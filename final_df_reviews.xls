I did manage to jump a few places in the queue due to not having all of their paperwork ready.

Antigua-and-barbuda,2018-03-30,"Check in: good, but not enough kiosks for the larger airlines ie American Security: Standard TSA-style take-of-your-shoes security. Terminal: It's a brand new aiport, opened in 2015. The old airport was hot and crowded with long lines. The new airport has jetbridges and is air-conditioned. It has plenty of seats. Cons: you can see in the bathrooms from outside and it is very hard to hear the PA system due to echo. (at my gate the agent used a microphone and portable amp instead). WiFi: You have to pay for the wifi, however there is a 15-minute free trial that requires you to give your full name and email address. Food: There are three restaurants which offer a variety of fare (sushi, pizza, burgers, sandwiches, pastries, etc.). However, they are expensive (one woman purchased two pieces of pizza, a salad, and a Corona beer for the price of $94 EC ($35 US). I purchased an Italian sandwich for $36 EC ($13 US). It was good, but I could get the same sandwich at home for half the price. Other: There are two important things to note. First, take into consideration that you must go through immigration both when you enter and when you leave Antigua. They still use paper customs forms. When you arrive, there is a departure stub on the form that you must keep if you want to leave. The second thing to note is that Antigua no longer collects a cash departure tax at the airport.

There are two coffee shops, and also a James Boag's bar/restaurant, which has a good selection of drinks and decent bar food. There are four gates downstairs, with additional seating areas.

One thing I always find to be a shortcoming is there is only one security line and when there are two flights leaving with a similar timeframe it can be a pain to get through. There have been maintenance issues the past two times I've been there and we waited in line for what seemed like ages only to have a Jetstar flight push in front of us because they were leaving first, meaning another long wait.

The terminal has had a facelift with the addition of baggage carousels, better arrival and departure gates and increased refreshment access. The stumbling point can often be security with just the one security entry, if you are unlucky to arrive when two aircraft are departing it can become quite a bottleneck. Car parking has been increased and long term parking although expensive is still quite reasonable, for example it is often cheaper to park you car than it is to get a taxi to and from the airport, depending on the length of your trip of course. The airports web page has a handy long and short term car parking calculator which I encourage you to use if you are thinking of driving to the airport.

For example, at departure you have to scan two separate codes and fill in all your details. One is to get into the terminal (wasn't too bad, basic information) but you have to do it at the entrance. There is seemingly no opportunity to fill it in at home, you have to do it while standing in the front of the terminal door. Of course for me it didn't work because it insists on sending you an SMS code to your WeChat phone number - which I don't have. However, they managed to work around that. At customs, you have to fill in another App, again, seemingly no opportunity to do it in advance. This is very intrusive as it asks for all sorts of information - including other than China where have you been before - we were two years in China - so this seemed fairly redundant. And, you can't say not applicable - you have to give it something, we just made up some BS and put that in. It also asked alot of irrelevant questions for departure (relevant for arrival, but didn't seem so for departure). All in all this was took ages to fill in, you do it inside the ""lining up"" area and as a result there was lots of congestion. Finally, the security check was over the top. The signs and first security guy says the standard ""laptops and liquids"" need to be taken out. But post X-Ray, everything - including USB cables, Power cables, phone chargers, even my house keys - had to be taken out, visually inspected and rescanned through the XRay machine. This was happening to everybody. Finally it was all very random. My wife had a 50ml Hand sanitiser attached to her bag, they confiscated that, but they let me take a 100ml spray bottle of lens cleaner, and they didn't find (despite the rigorous scanning and visual inspection) her replacement bottle of hand sanitiser (the confiscated one was almost empty). The whole experience of getting into the airport was very draining - but we didn't have much choice. Also, it took about 4 hours to complete the checkin and entry.

More international flights are coming in the next a few years. WUX can be served as the alternative arrival point to Shanghai, often with cheaper airfares and less frustrated flight experiences. Wuxi Metro Line 3 (to be completed in 2018) will link the city centre and Wuxi East High Speed Railway Station (transit via Metro Line 2), where you can take a short 30 mins' ride to Shanghai, 60 mins' ride to Nanjing, or a 4 hours' ride to Beijing. Clear custom at WUX is a breeze, 20 mins is all it takes, again, stress free. Same as luggage collection, almost instantaneously upon your arrival into the baggage claim area, another perk associated with ""smallish airport"". Taxi isn't a big deal at all, at most USD$20 can take you to the city centre, you can book a 5 star hotel in Wuxi online for as little as USD$100 per night, and Wuxi is also a popular tourist destination in China, you can visit the Jichang Garden at Xihui Park, where Beijing's famous Summer Palace was modelled and constructed as a replica of Jichang. Moreover, the nearby Taihu Lake has breath taking views and tranquility, especially in the spring and fall seasons. Try the Wuxi Steam Dumplings and soup Wonton, definitely number one in China.

Then, when you're allowed to enter the boarding area, there is a person who gets your documents and types something in a computer. Then, 20 feet ahead, there is another person with another computer who checks your passport. After that you pass through a small duty free and you think it's over. Wrong! Right at the entrance of the boarding zone there's another person behind a big table who requests you to open your hand luggage to be inspected. After some time, when you're waiting to be called to the gate, a lady approaches you and asks you your passport number.

In case you missed the terminal 1 stop you can walk from inside the terminal 2 to terminal 1 from a connecting corridor (8 minutes) but you can’t go to terminal 3.

In overhaul my check-in desk was easy to find and my check-in was fast. The security check was fast and not under pressure. They was a lot of people at the normal waiting line and ones you arrive at the security check desk you can stop at the one that have less travelers waiting.

The departure lounge is incredibly small. The size of one gate at a larger airport. It is incredibly cramped. Seating all full. A lot of people standing up against the wall and even in open space. There is a coffee/bar counter and a duty free shop. The boarding of the flights is a bit chaotic too. One ramp down to the apron. Two flights of pax actually got queued down either side of this small ramp. The upside is that a terminal extension appears to be in progress.

Then you gotta pass through the hoards of people waiting for family outside. It's sweet, but also pretty ridiculous. There's no way to get back upstairs for departures, except to go through the parkade...where neither elevator was in service. Back up there to check in, only to go BACK through exit immigration and filling out the same paper form for the second time in 2 hours. Hot as hell in there for the most part too. There's wifi in the terminal and it's not terrible, I'll give them that, but the rest of the terminal is pretty dreadful.

Hungary,2023-04-27,"Visited quite a few airports in Europe, but the only worse experience than in the Budapest airport is the one in Vienna. The airport looks nice, and is pretty modern, however, the staff working here are one of the most unpleasant people I have came across. While I do understand policies and procedures, they go above and beyond to make your day miserable and stress you out without any reason. Namely, I had bought a Hungarian palinka that I wanted to bring home, and upon security check they labeled my bag as suspicious and one woman rudely and with force started opening my backpack. Made me feel like a criminal while yelling at me how it is forbidden to bring more than 1000 ml of fluids. I, at no point had more than 1000ml of fluids, and the Palinka bottle itself was 100ml. Also, I had a type of thick yoghurt that in no way is a fluid, and that also was an issue for her. She demanded that I either eat the yoghurt and DRINK THE PALINKA on spot, or throw them away. Of course, I ate my yoghurt and threw away the Palinka. I couldn't even believe she suggested for me to down an alcoholic drink right before a flight. As mentioned, I do understand the rules and why they are in place, but forcing people to throw away stuff that is in no way against these policies is just wrong. I have travelled by plane many, many times and most of the times I had the same yoghurt with me and no one said anything against it. Many times I bought drinks from other countries, not exceeding the limit for fluids, and no one found any issue with it. This only casts a long shadow on the Hungarians.

But the catch is when people who are flying they have to access the departure gates only & must not require to wait in queue for the parking tickets. They can swivel past these gates, drop, and wait for 2 minutes, greet farewell & exit. Unnecessarily the problem sticks at the entry gate collecting the timestamp tickets.

Italy,2022-07-11,"The Marconi Express is a quick way of getting to the airport from the railway station in Bologna. The trains are pretty short and don't have many seats, but they are regular. It takes about 15 minutes and from the station, it is a short walk to the terminal building. The automatic ticket machines can be a little tempramental. The airport is small and probably never designed to handle the number of passengers it is handling. I'm beginning to feel that so many of my travel woes are down to Ryanair. They seem to have a knack of ruining every airport that they don't exclusivley use as they seem to take up every available slot with their high density aircraft. Both landside and airside, every space was crammed. I did manage to find a table at one of the few food outlets landside. I was lucky. Many of the tables and chairs were occupied by customers who had long finished any food that they might have had and were nursing a half empty bottle of water. Everything seems to take much longer in BLQ than in most other airports that I've travelled from. I had checked in online, but it made no difference. There were two queues. I was confused as to which one was the bag drop and which was the check-in. Both were moving as slowly as each other. It took at least 30 minutes to check-in. Security took another 40 minutes. The queue began at the top of the stairs and snaked about 400 metres around the length on the hall. It was all a bit disorganised. The departure lounge was equally as full as landside areas. All of the food and drink outlets had large queues and no available seats. There were no free seats anywhere in the departure lounge. Boarding was via transit buses. I waited until the queue had dissipated before approaching and boarded the last of the buses to leave, which had less than ten of us on board.",2,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,,2.0

I still had to wait 10 inutes after I had reached the designated carousel. BLG is compact and once in the arrivals hall, it is a short walk to the Marconi Express shuttle to Bologna railway station. The automatic ticket machines seemed a bit tempramental. Most people ahead of me had problems buying tickets.

The security check speeks surprisingly bad English. The guy took my phone with a QR-code and didn't give me back until I reminded him of it... Also, there was a mess with the gates and communications, although this was a Ryanair's fault as well.

There is no gates which can be connected to the airplane so you do not need to get of the plane by walking down the steps and then sit in the bus which will drive you to the airport terminal.

I have travelled to many places and international airports around the world, however, I was surprised, or even shocked and couldn't believe my eyes. It's a truly low-cost experience and is not making your flying a pleasant, but rather a painful experience. Shame on that... You won't get any piece of your mind at all... It's a bit bothering me.

Netherlands,2014-12-07,Very small but friendly & clean airport with easy bus connection from/to Groningen (the journey takes ~40 min. from the Central Station by bus #2).The overall opinion of mine is positive but I'd mention 3 negative points: - I would have expected at least one more shop in the terminal building as the only one offers a very few choice of products. - I find it a bit uncomfortable that I was not let to pass the security check until the PAX of the previous flight depart. (I guess it's due to the fact that there would not be enough space for the PAX of more than one flights in terminal building). - The only restaurant offers a poor variety of food.

The staff on the airport are very friendly and helpful. Due to the airports small size and low level of commercial activity it provides a hassle-free experience. However, for the same reasons the service amenities are few besides one restaurant serving typical roadside restaurant food (not meant as a negative characteristic) and some snacks and soft drinks. The quality of the food is above average, but nothing out of the ordinary. Furthermore, public transportation options are poor, with only one bus alternative with departures every 2 hrs or so, and it requires a 300m walk from the terminal to the bus stop. Beyond that, taxi is the only other option, or renting a car from Europcar which provides cars for rental at the airport. Parking at the airport is free.

Philippines,2019-07-22,"Let's start with the good things: it's easy to get to this airport. It's along the main road in Virac and there's lots of tricycles waiting. Now for the bad part: it's chaos overall. It starts with check in. There's no system, no check in facilities and the terminal building is a size or three too small to handle a single short haul jet aircraft like the A320. Add that most people in Virac are not used to flying and it easily takes over an hour to get checked in while the queue seems to be manageable and would take 5 to 10 minutes for a professional crew to process. And apparently people are just allowed to leave and enter the line at their own convenience, so the number of people waiting for you differs every minute. Now for security. It's lacking. There is no security here. They do a small scan when entering the terminal, and there's an x-ray machine for hand luggage and scanner for people, but they're not in use. Security staff just takes 5 seconds to go through your hand luggage, approve it, send you through the scanner and when it beeps, no one reacts. Hold luggage is delivered at check in and not scanned either. You can basically deliver anything here. There is no wifi, unless you have a Philippine phone. There is no business lounge. The general waiting area is about 3 sizes too small to contain all the people waiting for a small aircraft like the A320. There's simply not enough room. Apart from a toilet, there are no facilities here. Expect no shop or vending machine. There is none. There's a sign stating that there is a shop on the top floor, but its apparently indefinitely closed. There is a huge load of staff though. About 10 security guards, about 20 people working for the airline or airport are on site, but only 3 people really seem to be doing something productive.

Portugal,2023-11-27,"Porto Airport, also known as Francisco Sá Carneiro Airport, has several areas that could benefit from improvements to enhance the passenger experience. One of the primary concerns is the security check process. Currently, passengers are required to remove electronic devices from their bags and place them in separate trays for X-ray scanning. This procedure often leads to delays, discomfort, and the formation of long queues. Many modern airports have adopted advanced 3D X-ray technology, which allows for faster and more precise screening without the need to remove electronics from bags. Unfortunately, Porto Airport, much like Lisbon Airport, has yet to implement such technology, a change that would greatly improve efficiency and passenger convenience. Another significant issue is the limited operating hours of shops and services at the airport. Most facilities close after 10 PM and do not reopen until 5 or 6 AM the following day. This can be particularly inconvenient for passengers with very early morning flights or those arriving late at night. There are limited options for dining, shopping, or even waiting comfortably during these hours. The situation is further exacerbated by the restricted hours of the airport's only VIP lounge, which does not offer extended service to accommodate these passengers. Extending the operating hours of the VIP lounge, at least, would provide a much-needed amenity for travelers during these off-peak times.

Portugal,2023-11-27,"Porto Airport, also known as Francisco Sá Carneiro Airport, has several areas that could benefit from improvements to enhance the passenger experience. One of the primary concerns is the security check process. Currently, passengers are required to remove electronic devices from their bags and place them in separate trays for X-ray scanning. This procedure often leads to delays, discomfort, and the formation of long queues. Many modern airports have adopted advanced 3D X-ray technology, which allows for faster and more precise screening without the need to remove electronics from bags. Unfortunately, Porto Airport, much like Lisbon Airport, has yet to implement such technology, a change that would greatly improve efficiency and passenger convenience. Another significant issue is the limited operating hours of shops and services at the airport. Most facilities close after 10 PM and do not reopen until 5 or 6 AM the following day. This can be particularly inconvenient for passengers with very early morning flights or those arriving late at night. There are limited options for dining, shopping, or even waiting comfortably during these hours. The situation is further exacerbated by the restricted hours of the airport's only VIP lounge, which does not offer extended service to accommodate these passengers. Extending the operating hours of the VIP lounge, at least, would provide a much-needed amenity for travelers during these off-peak times.

Стоящий рядом со стойками ""бык"" на руках переносит багаж от стоек до общей ленты. Это выглядит как минимум смешно, но по факту - очень отстало. Радует, что ещё не введено маразматическое требование обязательного наличия аэропортового автобуса, которым пассажиры должны доставляться к самолёту (либо обратно - к зданию аэровокзала). Сейчас пассажиры самостоятельно преодолевают расстояние от самолёта до здания (либо обратно) за одну минуту, без необходимости тупо тратить время, ожидая, пока автобус наполнится людьми и тронется в путь, огибая всю внутриаэропортовую площадку. К сожалению, такая тупость была введена в аэропорту Нарьян-Мара - там тоже небольшой аэропорт, и такие вот автобусы реально убивают время пассажиров.

If you don't have lounge access there is not much to do at UVF airport once through security. There is some duty-free but it's all pretty expensive (and in $), better off getting it in UK. Food services was pretty dire with overpriced greasy food available plus massive queues and not very many places to sit. Bottles of cold Piton beer were available from the self-serve shop at $5 a bottle and there was no queue. The tannoy announcements were annoyingly loud (and unclear) so there isn't much chance of a quick shut-eye, not that there is the space for it either. Terminal was very small.

Saudi-arabia,2021-08-23,"It was the worst experience with the staff at KKIA. Travelling to Jeddah on SV1047, I was running late because of a wrong turn for terminal 5. I had baggage to checkin so it was crucial to make it to checkin at least 60 mins before departure. I had a sky priority tag on my boarding card which meant I can use the business class lanes. I couldn’t spot that at first so tried to speak to one of the supervisors at the checkin counters if I could skip the normal queue. As soon as I started to speak she stopped me and said rudely ‘can u give me a min?’ I stopped but was impatient due to the limited mins left. She hardly cared and got busy on a phone call! During this time I saw the priority sign on the opposite checkin bay. They was one passenger in front and I waited for him to finish. As soon as my turn came I tried to show my boarding card on the phone and the guy at the counter got busy on his mobile! After a long few seconds, he took the phone and I put the luggage on the belt. He asked me rudely to remove the previous tags I had on. He was like ‘remove that tag’. I mean, what happened to ‘please’ and a little courtesy? After this, I got thru the auto gate and to security check. Being as good as business I turned towards the fast track lane which is normally red carpeted. The lady there started waving as if shooing me away! So much prejudice! Can’t a normal looking person fly business? Does he have to suit up? It was only after she saw the red marked ‘sky priority’ on my card did she let me pass through. It’s ok if she stops me, but there’s definitely a better and much more courteous way! Ask me questions for God's sake, I’ll show you why I came this way… I’m telling you, the lady at the brand after security store was much more helpful and polite. This is the worst prejudice experience I’ve faced in this country! I hope they shape up…soon. Please understand we also are humans and can travel business or have a priority pass.

Not much to say except for the free WiFi which annoyed me a lot as it is useless to anyone who does not have a SIM plan there or wants to pay extra for another country’s roaming fees. You have to enter a verification code from either an email address or a phone number to be able to connect which is impossible to ever receive because you don’t have an internet connection in the first place! That is why you are trying to connect! In short you cannot connect with out a SIM plan for South Africa with roaming or an international SIM also with additional fees for international roaming to be able to receive a verification code. Otherwise, some of the staff there are outstandingly friendly and all will help you to where you need to be if you require it. The airport could do with a major clean due to age and many facilities being dirty from very frequent use but this doesn’t make too much of a difference considering once you are through customs and security there are lots of shops managed and cleaned individually and the seats and waiting/resting areas are relatively clean. Toilets are always clean due to the cleaner that waits there and cleans immediately. Overall a good airport to be at but not overly outstanding.",4,5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,

Like every other airport in Turkey this one also has a 2 time security check excluding the boarding. But again with low amount of people entering the airport it took only a couple of minutes.

Uganda,2023-11-27,"Entebbe Airport, serving as Uganda's primary international gateway, disappointingly falls short of the expected standards. The airport's outdated facilities are a significant concern, especially considering its role as the country's entry point. A lack of basic comforts for passengers is starkly noticeable. One of the most pressing issues is the inconvenient access to the terminal. Vehicles are required to stop a considerable distance away, forcing passengers to walk at least 100 meters, often while dragging luggage and navigating ramps. This becomes particularly problematic during rain, as only VIPs or VVIPs are allowed closer access, leaving others exposed to the elements. Regarding specific aspects of the airport experience: - Road Access: The toll road leading to the airport is in excellent condition, a stark contrast to the airport itself. - Check-in: The check-in process is passable but could benefit from reduced waiting times. - Security Check: The security checkpoints, requiring passengers to exit their vehicles for metal detector screening, seem inefficient. This process overlooks the possibility of drivers carrying prohibited items in the vehicle. - Terminal Facilities: The terminal offers minimal amenities for those waiting for flights. The VIP lounge is the only refuge for a modicum of comfort. - Wi-Fi: The presence and quality of Wi-Fi service are unclear, but it seemed virtually non-existent. - Food and Retail Services: Options for dining and shopping are severely limited. In summary, Entebbe Airport is in dire need of an overhaul. The current state of the airport, with its outdated facilities and lack of basic amenities, provides a less-than-ideal experience for travelers. A new passenger terminal is under construction, which brings a glimmer of hope. However, it isn't likely to be completed before the second half of 2024.

Uganda,2023-06-23,"A Depressing Ordeal at Entebbe Airport Having recently had the misfortune of traveling through Entebbe Airport, I find it my duty to warn fellow travelers about the horrors that lie in wait. The moment you step foot inside, it becomes clear that you've made a grave mistake. The passenger terminal is nothing short of appalling. Imagine the smallest, most ill-equipped bus station you've ever had the displeasure of visiting, multiply that discomfort by ten, and you might begin to approach the woeful conditions of this place. There is no suitable structure to accommodate the rush of travelers, and the amenities are just as sparse. My ill-fated choice to fly with Turkish Airlines and Ethiopian merely amplified my troubles. In a twist of fate that, in hindsight, seems entirely predictable, my luggage did not arrive with my flight. Given the obvious shortcomings of the airport, I wasn't surprised, just disappointed. The situation devolved further as I attempted to retrieve my lost baggage. The baggage claim staff, if one can indeed refer to them as such, were lackadaisical at best and negligent at worst. Slow to react, devoid of any motivation, and exuding an aura of casual indifference, they made the agonizing ordeal of a lost luggage even more tormenting. Their evident lack of commitment and professionalism did not instill any confidence in their ability to perform their duties effectively. Adding insult to injury, if your luggage happens to arrive in a damaged state - a scenario that, given my experience, seems more likely than not - their response is simply that they can do nothing. As if losing one's luggage wasn't stressful enough, to hear that any damages incurred will not be accounted for is a disheartening blow. It's a trial of patience to assert your rights and make any headway in this chaotic environment. One needs to be prepared to go through the rigmarole of collecting every possible shred of documentation and evidence, and then engage the airline in your home country's court. In summary, Entebbe Airport is a veritable nightmare of inefficiency, apathy, and disorganization. It's a stark contrast to the tranquility and beauty of Uganda itself. Travellers beware: if you value your peace of mind and your possessions, avoid this airport at all costs.",1,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,

And worse still is over £13 to park for an hour, and £5 just for the privilege of dropping someone off. It's criminal that they bleed their customers of cash at every opportunity. And have to mention that baggage reclaim is a joke. Dont rush through immigration (if you get the chance) because your bag with the priority bag tag will be the last one out after at least an hour of waiting.",2,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,

Also the airport itself looks nice, but is shorthanded on choices and so forth. I had a morning flight, and I did my research and ate before I went since the only true breakfast choices past security is Starbucks and Chilis. Rest weren't open yet. Also like any Starbucks in an airport, it was painfully packed for those who needed caffeine to survive the day. The shops are fine. There is a whiskey store, but if you fly out Sunday, they can't start selling until 1pm due to blue laws nonsense that should be off the books. I digress, I wasn't planning on getting anything, but they had some good whiskies as a last minute gift idea. Otherwise your stores are basically the news store with snacks and a magazine. I didn't see a full book store at all, or an electronic store. But the news stores to vending machines sold a good selection of headphones. Finally, the seating is outdated. They don't have outlets at all outside of a random wall spot that I was lucky to find at an empty gate that morning, but no luck at a full gate. Wifi worked on my phone, but not on my PC. It refused to be authorized. Overall it's an okay airport. It's clean, lighting is good, and the facilities work. The only huge issue is the wifi for me at least.

Vietnam,2023-04-14,"This is a horrible airport for flying out Internationally. It takes way too long to get through as there are 3 separate ID checks. 1 to get to the immigration line, 1 at immigration which is needed, and then the security check. There is no reason to have one pre immigration. This just caused us to wait a lot longer in line. The pre immigration check was then messed up even more due to the fact that they had no idea what they were doing and allowed a lot of people to cut. They then only took paper boarding passes, and not my electronic one. Its 2023. Catch up.",1,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,,,1.0
Vietnam,2023-01-21,Not far from downtown Hanoi. Not a bad airport at all. Checkin was pretty simple but online check-in was not available for this flight (Thai Smiles).

Vietnam,2024-03-09,"Tsn airport is a decent airport when it is not too crowded, however, it is terrible when compared to other airports around the region such as Bangkok, Singapore or Kuala Lumpur. The check in is decent, but at the International terminal the immigration lines are always crazy long, since the airport still hasn't invested in smart gates, and the people operating are often very slow. Furthermore, there are individual lines for each counter rather than one long snake line which doesnt make much sense. The process could also be faster if they allow families to go together, but they only allow one at a time. At security, they make you take off everything including shoes, watches, ipads and belts, which delays the whole process and doesn't make sense to me since in many other airports you don't have to take anything out. The departure area is quite small for the main airport of a large city, and it clearly over capacity. There is not much to do, with mainly souvenir and a few designer shops. The food selection is also quite underwhelming, not meeting International standards. I have visited this airport many times over the last 6 years and barely anything has changed. While it's not the worst airport in the world, it is definitely one of the worst in Asia. The interior of the terminal is also very bland and uninviting, rather than open and airy, maybe okay for an airport in the early 2000s. It's a shame that they haven't made this airport more comparable to any other airports in the region, and I hope the new airport under construction will be better. Even though there are not many flights from here to connect to, if you have a connecting flight somewhere I urge you to choose Bangkok or Singapore instead as you will have a much more comfortable layover.",2,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,

Vietnam,2023-09-30,"As shown in my review inbound to SGN, the airport is a massive and messy airport. The check in process was flawless there was no queue for business class passengers. Our departure, which was around 12am was during the night time peak hours. Due to this, the 8-10 all passports emigration lanes weren't able to handle all of these passengers ( the lanes were handling passengers of 7 wide body departures and some narrow body planes departing.) The next step, the TSA check was another chaos where only 4 x-ray machines had to check all these people. Inside the terminal wasn't too bad and there was a decent amount of shopping options and some dining venues. We got the access to one of the SASCO lounges at SGN airport and we chose the Rose lounge, which was closer to our gate. The decent lounge had some hot meals and some tea and coffee and had great apron views. Overall, SGN airport should try their best to improve customers' experience by making the emigration and TSA check process faster.",2,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,1.0
Vietnam,2023-09-26,"Worst airport experience ever. Our flight landed around 10""30pm which was around the late night peak hour. Our terrible experience started with the massive queue for immigration that just wasn't able to handle even with all of the counters open and we waited in the hot, humid terminal for almost 30 minutes for our passports to be stamped. Our experience just got worse when we found out that all passengers were forced to go through the customs in the ""items to declare"" lanes even if they have nothing to declare. The lane was packed with people and after our bags were scanned through x-ray machines, they were piled up and mixed up with other passengers' baggage and we needed to search for our bags. Now it gets even worse. Exhausted, we tried to sit down a little bit but we realised that there aren't any seating areas so we decided to catch an Uber with our phone which we failed since the airport wifi wasn't working. That was when several men from the taxi counter started to try to scam us. (these people are supposed to offer correct taxi prices and information to different areas, not try to scam passengers) Overall, the SGN airport is an embarrassment of Vietnam and HCMC deserves a better airport rather than this miserable, chaotic airport.",1,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,
