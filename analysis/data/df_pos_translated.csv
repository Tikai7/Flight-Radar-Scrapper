0,1,"The Kabul airport has improved. It's a lot cleaner and they have upgraded their facilities. There is a new lounge, not connect with Emirates/FlyDubai yet but one can purchase entry. The old Business class lounge is a waste. They have opened several new eateries."
1,5,The domestic terminal is quite run down.
2,8,"A very nice terminal, recent, modern, comfortable. The trip by bus to Tirana (there are no train, tram or metro) is less comfortable and can take from half an hour to nearly one hour according to traffic, which is hectic in town at the rush hours."
3,10,In 2023 still not admit the digital boarding pass. You have to go to the fate to print the boarding pass
4,11,"Tirana’s airport is way too small compared to the number of visitors, alltough you can spot some nice plane such as Embraers, CRJ’s,etc.. 3/5"
5,12,The immigration staff are rude and impersonal. Atm's charge a small fortune to withdraw cash however the exchange rate is extremely good at the kiosk! Wifi is awful and rarely works.
6,14,We asked the lady at the check in for a window like 5F and she gave it to me. Than at the security they controlled us and no problems. We ate something at the Bar there waiting for the Boarding to start. We went at the airplane with busses. Small but a modern and nice airport. Overall rating 10/10
7,17,"Queues were rather long, which meant that there was a lot of waiting around. However, the staff were friendly and there were plenty of seats to sit in while we waited for the line to shorten so that we could board."
8,20,"This flight was a great flight for me and my family flying to Algeria, arriving to Algiers and departing from there was excellent, i think this airport coming from my preference has a huge potential into being one of the best airports in Africa and globally, its also quite clean and i always see cleaners around mopping the floor, the building was quite modern and huge but there was quite a lack of entertainment for the children."
9,21,"Good airport, modern, but please be aware that the immigration might take a lot of time for non-Algerians, so be on time on departure!"
10,24,This is the best airport in Africa :D ....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
11,26,"Excellent very bright, best in north Africa ...nice airport Algiers / Houari Boumediene. very clean, quick passage through immigration, Baggage in 10 minutes. undoubtedly the best in North Africa."
12,27,"Excellent: I like this airport. Profissional and kind immigration/customs staff. Quick processing in both ways: no time lost, no long queues, just few minutes to go through all controls. Wifi is available but not for free: WIFI access cards can be purchased from stores inside airport."
13,28,"One of the nicest in Africa, very bright and clean. It still needs some improvements such as more shops and restaurants, but in overall it is a very nice and comfortable airport. Besides, it will be soon linked with Algiers underground system, which is a very good thing, given the prices asked by some taxi drivers..."
14,29,"as i flight attendant i find DAAG's new look one of the best in Africa , more than this , the services provided are quite fine , they do the job, maybe the problem that faces passengers is related to security and check , here sleeps the difficulty, but except check.. everything is alright and so fine just make sure you fly with Tassilli airlines to enjoy your trips ..."
15,38,What is the use of tagging the business class passenger bags when the wait for collection is exactly the same as economy passengers. Business class have the privilege to leave the flight first and then wait with all other passengers for luggage. The Priority sticker does not mean anything in this instance.
16,39,"The lounge has no toilet, the toilet on the airport is a mess, with no paper and sinks with no water or broken. There's no much option for food. The service connection system and staff are confusing. And there's no wifi on the airport."
17,45,The airport is small for the number os passengers that have now a days but is very nice. So comfortable. Most of the Toilets are out of order
18,51,"Getting to the airport was simple given the number of taxis on the island. I'm not aware of any public transport options, but taxis would be more reliable. Check-in and security were not a problem. Several shops and food and drink outlets are available airside, including Big Banana. Boarding was straightforward, if a bit back to front in my opinion."
19,53,Small airport but new and air conditioned. Baggage reclaim is slow for an airport with very few flight arrivals. Immigration was quick and easy.
20,54,"Nice airport: small, clean, several food/drink options. Comfortable seating near gates. Executive Lounge was nice (Great outside seating area with sunshades overlooking the runway: wish more airports offered the option of outside seating after clearing security)"
21,55,"Small, modern airport. Few Duty free shop nad fast food. No chance to smoke anywhere. Friendly people"
22,56,"Check in: good, but not enough kiosks for the larger airlines ie American Security: Standard TSA-style take-of-your-shoes security. Terminal: It's a brand new aiport, opened in 2015. The old airport was hot and crowded with long lines. The new airport has jetbridges and is air-conditioned. It has plenty of seats. Cons: you can see in the bathrooms from outside and it is very hard to hear the PA system due to echo. (at my gate the agent used a microphone and portable amp instead). WiFi: You have to pay for the wifi, however there is a 15-minute free trial that requires you to give your full name and email address. Food: There are three restaurants which offer a variety of fare (sushi, pizza, burgers, sandwiches, pastries, etc.). However, they are expensive (one woman purchased two pieces of pizza, a salad, and a Corona beer for the price of $94 EC ($35 US). I purchased an Italian sandwich for $36 EC ($13 US). It was good, but I could get the same sandwich at home for half the price. Other: There are two important things to note. First, take into consideration that you must go through immigration both when you enter and when you leave Antigua. They still use paper customs forms. When you arrive, there is a departure stub on the form that you must keep if you want to leave. The second thing to note is that Antigua no longer collects a cash departure tax at the airport. Overall: It's probably the best airport I've visited in the West Indies."
23,59,One of the best airports i've ever been. The People working there were very helpful and very nice.
24,60,Exec lounge was nice but small. Good service from hot assistant.
25,63,Nice urban airport close to the city centre of Buenos Aires with potentially spectacular views across the city provided you are on the correct side of the aircraft according to the direction of take-off
26,64,The International portion of AEP has no business class lounges. There are a few reasonable restaurants where one can sit such as Outback. I was going to Brazil. It was worth the issues to not have to go out to Ezeiza to fly though.
27,65,"Airport champion for its location, ""next to"" the center of Buenos Aires. Despite its small size, it is perfect for those who want to access Buenos Aires and have quick connections across South America."
28,66,"A clean airport, with several gastronomic options, it hurts the charging stations, very slow."
29,67,"This airport is a quick, city airport. It is easy to get to the airport and the security check was fast. Food was really expensive and there was no wifi."
30,68,It is an airport with a lot of passenger movement and despite its renovations... it is not very functional... it should be bigger...
31,70,Been there while in reforbishing. It was a mess. The airport is small and very crowded altought it's easy to get to it.
32,71,Easy access to the airport but arrive with time because the check in is very slow. Food services are too expensive.
33,72,"We were lucky, we didn't find too many people queuing for security, but we had already been waiting too much in the baggage-drop line. What we didn't like was the lack of places to eat in the airside."
34,73,Ground services are terrible! Waited more than 1 hour for parking area. Than waited Stair and bus for getting the terminal. In terminal there was a long queu for custom. They are so slow!!
35,74,Always a great experience. The new international terminal is very organized and makes things very easy for travelers.
36,79,"I think that at the international airport - the gates of the country, there could be a better condition of the premises where luggage is received, and an immediate response should be organized to the fact that the passengers who arrived are both children and very elderly people - accordingly, the veterinary service of Senasa didn't have to keep my family at her counter for an hour and a half!! (without offering a chair to my mother of 80 years, until I myself demanded) and not even offering water to the child !!"
37,82,I used terminal C for this boarding and it caught my attention that there were almost no food options in the departure lounge. Unfortunate.
38,85,"It is a very good airport, easy to get to, comfortable and with excellent Wi-Fi. Gastronomic options are not many."
39,86,"A nice airport, easy to get to with several options. The terminal is adequate and the Wifi network is good."
40,87,"Nice airport, very comfortable and with charging stations. The wifi is very fast and is always available."
41,88,Small airport. Ascent and descent by sleeves. There is little food and shopping available. Access is quick and simple and there is Wi-Fi at the airport.
42,89,"Boarding area bathroom is not big enough. There should be another one. Beverages machine swallowed 10 pesos and stopped working, I lost that money."
43,90,It was ok according to the huge demmand during that week end. Flight took-off on time and there were no delays at all. Clear day.
44,91,"It was not crowded, and as I live in Cordoba and close to the airport I have no troubles in getting there. Check-in was quick and they help me deciding the best seat regarding windows and comfort."
45,92,"Cordoba's Taravella Int'l Airport is a medium size airport, that works as a hub for Aerolíneas Argentinas, Austral, Flybondi, and Norwegian (coming soon). It has many international flights with Copa, Latam, Aerolíneas Argentinas, Gol, Azul, AirEuropa. The space is very confortable, it has some places to eat or drink, many chairs with AC and USB power outlets, and free WiFi."
46,93,Airport has a considerable domestic/international aerial traffic due to be an AR/AU third longest hub.Small but not so stressfull enviorment.
47,94,COR Airport has not ILS and it's so difficult for depart or arrive if there are bad meteorological conditions.
48,97,The airport is new and so beautiful but it’s extremely far away from downtown and there’s not so much options of transport and they are expensive.
49,98,"I just use the airport for arrival> Baggage claim was very quick. The airport is 30km far from the city. A shuttle service is available (desk after the baggage claim), have to pay by cash only (absolutly not normal in an airport!!)"
50,99,fast boarding
51,100,Beautiful airport in the middle of nowhere!
52,102,The airport is being repared
53,103,Very small and fills up easily. There is wifi and it works well. Access is regular and there is a train station 200m away.
54,104,It took like half an hour for us since the plane landed until we reached the terminal. Bus was very crowded.
55,105,"Small, low cost airport. In my case it was difficult to get there from the center of Buenos Aires, because the train did not run. It doesn't have much comfort, and it is small if several flights leave together."
56,109,"Everty time exceedingly kind and friendly law enforcers. Fast check-in, but limited food and retail services. Good free wifi!"
57,110,"Services on schedule and generally good weather, the treatment of the staff inside the airport is excellent and we are amazed by the improvements that have arisen through the renovations. Extremely expensive Wi-fi, perfect transportation service, although there could be more public transportation services."
58,111,"Services on schedule and generally good weather, the treatment of the staff inside the airport is excellent and we are amazed by the improvements that have arisen through the renovations. Extremely expensive Wi-fi, perfect transportation service, although there could be more public transportation services."
59,114,The bars are very expensive
60,115,"Neuquen's airport is very small, not jetways and only one security check point. There is only one cafe, and it isn't to good. Otherwise, the air traffic is constant, so you can take good pictures."
61,116,NQN airport is small and doesn't have jetways. There is only one hand baggage scanner. The flight was excellent as usual with LAN. Excellent crew and service. The food was Ok for a flight this short.
62,119,"it was raining on the inside, only one place to buy ""the worst sandwich ever"" and so expensive, Security made us wait outside the airport when it was empty on the inside."
63,120,"A very small, efficient airport. The airport was far from anywhere so it was at least a 1 hour drive to the nearest village. Customs was quick and we got our baggage in no time. However, be prepared fo expensive food and little to no wifi, there is also no lounge."
64,123,"I don't have a lot to say. It's a small airport, and when we arrived, we were the only flight at that moment, so the baggage claim room was not that full and the process was fast."
65,132,"A quick airport, a bit far from the city but lots of duty free and there is cheaper food. There is a little bit of wifi. Immigrations was quick and we got our bags quick."
66,133,"Small little airport from where you hopefully will start into the North, becazse you then fly over the beautiful lake and one has an amazing view from up there. Getting there is a bit complicated by bus and also a bit expensive, if you compare the prices to the ones from the subte in Buenos Aires."
67,134,Airport was saturated due to peak season. Getting was lucky because the local bus has a 2 hr frecuency.
68,135,Getting off the airport was difficult as the local bus only comes by every 2 hours even tho it is the peal season with many tourist comming by to the sky centers. Taxis had a long delay as well. Few options to get to the city center.
69,136,You can get a 72 bus with SUBE card.It costs about $8 ARS. Check in staff is friendly and nice. Security check is fast.I got a breakfast at the restaurant outside the departure lounge.It was convenient. Lounge is old and no amusing at all.
70,137,BRC is an small airport with a restaurant and some souvenirs. You can get a van for $110 ARS .Driver take a way for all the passengers to get into destination. Wi fi is good.You get a sanitary control even for domestics arrivals.
71,138,"The airport is very far from the city, it has a very good and widely used public transport service. The view from the terminal is excellent, you can see the runway, mountains and the planes parked at the boarding gates. Photos can be taken from an exclusive place for this. It has constant aircraft traffic. The WIFI IS EXCELLENT, you can watch Netflix easily. Translate this if you want!"
72,145,"Incredibly nice looking tiny airport. Very nice wood constructure. I only flew in there, but you have to have your luggage scanned again if you arrive."
73,147,"Great airport, looks really nice :) it's small but have atmosphere like on the end of the world :))) Get to the airport only with taxi. Must pay tax when you leaving about 26 ARS for person. Everything was great"
74,150,Yerevan airport is 30 minutes away from the city. Immigration queues are long but manageable. Food options are limited and expensive. Duty free is good enough. Beer is cheaper than water in this airport which was weird.
75,152,"A simple airport. However, the police officers and guide staff were all very kind and helpful."
76,154,"Bus no.17 and no. 18 runs directly to the city center, which is more cheaper than the taxi. One way costs with big luggages only 300 AMD (0,50€)"
77,155,"Zvartnots has become a modern, safe, comfortable airport. In terms of security and electronic services it is better than many European airports. It is incomparable better than neighbor country airports. I would love to see more flights with Armenian carriers. Very nice, modern airport, always well treated. staff good command of knowledge of foreign languages"
78,156,to BM ... they have a modern airport only for people and not turkeys. if u r a racist (fascist) tell the people firstly who you are... u can tell the people how a turkey eet grass ............................................................................... ------------------------------------------------------------------
79,157,"Zvartnots has become a modern, safe, comfortable airport. In terms of security and electronic services it is better than many European airports. It is incomparable better than neighbor country airports. I would love to see more flights with Armenian carriers. For passengers: large areas, free fast wifi with good coverage. For pilots: one of best ATC services in large region! Happy flying"
80,164,"Small airport. Distance from plane to car is short, not as short as TXL, but good enough. People from Aruba are friendly so service at the airport is good"
81,165,Follow @JFKSPOTTING On instagram! _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
82,166,"The pre-flight customs when flying to the USA is honestly inane. They treat you as if you literally did just get off of a plane from somewhere else rather than walk through like, two rooms. It'd be much better if it was like the pre-flight customs for flights to the USA in the Montréal airport. Luckily, someone plucked us out of the 4th unacceptably long line we were in for the SECOND security check to speed it up and put us on the plane. We got there almost three hours early, and we almost missed our flight! Talk about island time. Still, the airport itself wasn't so bad, and I think that day was just particularly crowded. The issues were heavily exacerbated by the over-an-hour-long wait to check-in from American Airlines. They wouldn't accept online check-ins or mobile boarding passes, for some reason????"
83,167,"Average holiday airport, too many flights arriving together caused long queues"
84,168,Fast easy no hastle
85,169,small but adequate
86,170,"I was in ADL for a <2 hour layover from Brisbane to Perth, and primarily stayed down the Virgin Australia end of the terminal, though I walked through the retail area next to the international part of the terminal looking for lunch. I have to say the design of the terminal is annoying as you have to walk for a while between the Virgin Australia / REX gates to any facilities. Once you're there, you will find plenty of food and duty free shops to purchase from. Overall, a good airport once you're properly in the terminal."
87,171,"The airport was close to city. However, bus service my not be friendly for passengers. There were considerable number of self-checkin kiosks in departure hall. Several bag drop machines were also capable to handle whole Virgin Australia passengers departing from Adelaide. As I preceded the security check at around 5:00am, there were around 50 people waiting at the security screening. However, all 5 screening lanes were operated for passengers which I was really appreciated. However, limited choice of food services was allowed at early time and quality was not good either."
88,172,"The airport was close to the city (just 15 minutes drive). Due to the wind direction, the aircraft only taxied a short distance to the gate. The distance between the gate and the baggage claim was also reasonable. However, the conveyor belt contained four flights which might accumulate a lot of people."
89,173,Cross border registration counters at arrival gate. Every traveller must complete an interview by the authorised officer
90,174,"al. Because of the prior exit of the business customer, the customs was merely filled with a few people. This naturally resulted in the instantaneous process of immigration. The security check of Australiagovernment provided me a fast track which was directly process to the"
91,175,Staff seemed to be processing the security line reasonably quickly even with only one lane open. No food or beverage avail apart from vending machines.
92,177,"Slept at Atura hotel, very well made and positioned. Check-in was easy. however security lines could get a big long. The internet was really fast at speeds of over 100mpbs download"
93,178,Adelaide Airport is easy to get through there are 2 main hallways for Domestic Flights there is a line on a wall next to the Burger King which line is always full because the Qatar and Emirates flight is departing close to each other
94,179,Getting to the airport was a breeze with the convenience of the Atura Hotel. Airport is laid out in a neat way
95,181,"All you could want for arriving at a Regional Airport. Walk straight in the building to see the baggage carousel in front of you and access to restrooms and the cafe (though closed) available straight away. Could only ask that the cafe was open, but otherwise great arrival experience."
96,182,TRANSIT
97,184,"The AirPort was small and sweet, perfect size for the city of Alice Springs. Getting to the airport was no problem. It’s not very far out of the city and if you are driving a rental car the signage is very clear. Check in was a bit slow, had to queue for a while since only one of their check in desks were open. Security check was quick and smooth, no queueing. Terminal facilities were also good. Plenty of bathrooms. The wifi, however, was slow and really annoying to use, and there weren’t enough restaurants. There was one café but that one was quite crowded. Overall it was a good experience."
98,185,"Perfect small airport. No queues for check in, security, cafe, shops. Free wifi. Comfortable waiting area and an outside seating area under the trees. Easy boarding walk across the Tarmac. If only all airports were this easy!"
99,186,it's a small regional airport so don't expect anything fancy
100,187,Nice small airport for a quick transfer
101,188,Great airport. Great staff.
102,189,"Plenty of facilities, from shops to food"
103,190,"lovely small airport, was really busy, a globemaster was parked up , mostly props, 1 737, and a bae146"
104,192,"It's a simple domestic airport. No food services, but they found space for a gift shop. Getting in and out is easy as a parking space and a long drop off zone. Check in is alright, security too. Nothing much to say other than no real food source, other than a few vending machines!"
105,195,"Good small airport, one of the best regional airports I have been to. Fun ""observation area"" which i saw my plane land in. I would have to bring a little more to do, as there was not enough to see/do there. What can you expect though? Too expensive for a Coffee though."
106,196,it's a regional airport so there's no shops or any other services
107,197,"Excellent facilities for such a remote airport, particularly with car hire companies, but there is little to eat."
108,199,its was great new area lots of spare time coming really close to the 737-800 not busy in check in easy to get though security was not busy not much people there nice and quiet but they were still upgrading inside so it will be better there wifi is really great the lounge is okay hard and soft at the same time
109,200,"A good/handy airport to get to Sydney or Melbourne when I need it most. A nice new terminal and a penitential new runway to fit Airbus A321s, it's gradually growing bigger. recommend the Burger place."
110,201,Small but efficient.
111,202,tiny tiny tiny
112,205,"nice security, made sure to let everyone know what they needed to do for cleaning, sanitary stations weren’t all the best it was a mat on the ground with alcohol poured in it"
113,207,"Brisbane international treminal is very busy in the morning when the big planes come for example from, Dubai, Vancouver, San Fransisco, Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul. And sinse Australia have very strickt rules of hwo can come in or not. To get thru evrything we had to stand and wait for about 2 houres. So if you travel international just know if you want to get thru the customs fast don't travel there so you are there in the morning."
114,208,easy to get to the internasjonal terminal. The check in took some time but after some time we were thru. TRhe security check didb't take long sinse we were the last plane to depart out of the terminal. there were many placesto charge youre phone and realx. finding the gate was easy and the boarding was efficient.
115,209,Busy VA Terminal with many transiting and connecting flights landing and departing. Information was made available via many info boards. Friendly lounge staff and accommodating to ensure passenger comfort.
116,210,"Probably the best airside views of any airport in Australia, when combining how much of the airport you can see with the variety of traffic."
117,211,SQ Silver Kris lounge was very small but it's understandable because we are not at their hub but the food was very good!
118,213,"The lounge was very good, however, our flight was cancelled shortly after. Would have loved an apron view off the lounge as well."
119,214,Very easy to find our gate. Check in was alright. Gate agents were nice. Good for plane spotting at the gate.
120,215,the theatre of security. apparently a million dollar body scanner can't tell the difference between a tissue in your pocket and a bomb.
121,217,"Love Broome Airport. Small and cute! Just a few points: Business lounge only opens 2 hrs MAX before the flight. That's it. Even if the flight is delayed, it closes after 2 hours."
122,218,It’s a15 minute walk from the China Town to the terminal. No queue at security check even though there were two flights leaving around the same time. Waiting area has plenty of seating. Free wifi is reliable and quick.
123,219,Flight arrived early. Easy off plane and straight out of airport. Didn’t spend any time in the terminal.
124,226,"Wynyard airport is easy to get to with free car park and wifi. Facilities are fine. Fast check in, what you would expect at a small airport. Security is done at Melbourne airport and is also quick. REX have four flights to Melbourne a day, there are also flights to King Island Launceston and Hobart with other companies. A new airline just starting flights to Essendon."
125,227,"A little dezpagueri like yts daddy I had a problem with suckarmelame same tt. Now, aside from the jokes, the lie is that he was ready to spend a little while. A little bit of dezpagueri like yts daddy, I had a problem with suckarmelame too tt. Now, aside from the jokes, the lie is that he was ready to spend a little while. A little bit of dezpagueri like yts daddy, I had a problem with suckarmelame too tt. Now, aside from the jokes, the lie is that he was there for a while."
126,228,"A little dezpagueri like yts daddy I had a problem with suckarmelame same tt. Now, aside from the jokes, the lie is that he was ready to spend a little while. A little bit of dezpagueri like yts daddy, I had a problem with suckarmelame too tt. Now, aside from the jokes, the lie is that he was ready to spend a little while. A little bit of dezpagueri like yts daddy, I had a problem with suckarmelame too tt. Now, aside from the jokes, the lie is that he was there for a while."
127,229,"Landed and once we got off, there was a huge line for immigration/customs as there were over 300 people on the flight. We were at the back of the line and we were still on the jetbridge????! It took us nearly 2 hours to get out of the airport including baggage claim and immigration as there were only 3 staff working at 5 am."
128,230,"Good enough for a smaller airport, would have liked to see some better cleanliness though. Our bags arrived covered in blue goo."
129,231,No public transport to airport. Expensive shuttle or taxi or walking 30+ min on a roadside through the wetlands
130,232,"Fastest check-in + security ever, both done in less than 5 minutes. Decent food selection for small airport."
131,233,We landed at Cairns. Departed 20mins late and arrived just before 5 am. Immigration wasn't a lot of help though. Just a long line of security. Baggage claim was also crowded and took us nearly 1.5 hours to get through security and baggage claim.
132,234,"Easy to get to, easy check-in, can be a fair degree of walking from the car-park if you are unlucky with your spot and in the height of summer can be a bit uncomfortable (humidity). Otherwise a nice enough airport, but security can sometimes be a bit of a bottleneck (in high season)."
133,235,Overall pretty good and everything very organized and efficient. The main downside : hardly any power points in the departure area. I think in 2017 we can expect power points USB ports to be available....
134,236,Small and unspectacular airport. The domestic flights to e.g. Brisbane and Sydney are usually crowded at the Check-In counter. The post-security facilities are limited yet sufficient.
135,237,"International terminal is very crowded and long queues for check in and customs. The immigration officials weren't taking the job very seriously, talking to each other in between passengers. Duty free was very expensive, a chocolate bar and some Weathers were $10."
136,238,"Cairns Airport was good, with great Wi-Fi and the flight was on time being 15 Minutes earlier than expected. Lounge facilities were good with many shops but little franchise shops. The flight was great with no turbulence and a smooth landing and departure, cabin crew was polite and not rude."
137,239,"This airport is is recreational and training flights only so there is no transport, check-in, security (apart from a small fence), terminals, wifi, stores (apart from flight schools) or a lounge. However these services many be available depending on the flight centre/business you are affiliating with."
138,240,"Great airport South West of Sydney and Bankstown airport mainly used for leisure and learning how to fly. This airport has a wide variety of GA (General Aviation) aircraft from small Cirrus SR22s to multi turbojet private planes like the Cessna Citation III and everywhere in-between including fighter jets, gliders and helicopters. Camden airport is also home to the only blimp in the Southern Hemisphere and the largest number of gliding operations."

141,243,Small private airport full of pipers and Cessna as well as two Cessna Citations including a Cessna Citation 3.
142,244,I was at the airport for about 2hrs transiting between flight. A great airy airport with plenty of natural light and plenty of photography spots through the glass windows even though they are tinted. More eating options would be fantastic.
143,245,Very Awsome and smooth flightvfrvrcffdfecfrvfrvrvgrvgr rvgbtbybgrgggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg
144,246,Got off the plane straight away and immediately collected bags and left the airport so not much to base the rating off.
145,247,Unfortunately no priority check-in for business class/platinum passengers with international connections
146,248,The new terminal is fantastic. Just needs some more aircraft movements to make waiting go by quicker.
147,249,Best and Easiest airport to travel in and out of in Australia. Beautiful new terminal and facilities.
148,252,"The issue at Canberra airport is the poorly designed security check in. IT is like a supermarket checkout rather tan an airport security system, where people have to line up to have their carry-on luggage checked out. The architects have a lot to answer for. This was not designed for passengers - it was designed for architectural reasons."
149,253,Amazing airport
150,254,"Clean airport, quick and easy check-in and security. One small cafe in the departures hall. There is a Qantas Regional Lounge for Qantas frequnt Flyers."
151,255,"Coffs Harbour is a great airport. It's a small airport but that doesn't stop it from being a good one. Dropping off your luggage is quick, depending on the airline and how many people fly it, security is quick to get through, but seating wise, there inst a lot of seating. Sometimes a large majority of people have to stand up. The little cafe is good but doesn't have a lot of choices of food and drinks. They have power points if you need to charge, although there inst a lot. I haven't tried WiFi but from what I've heard and seen, its not the best, using data would probably be a better option. You have to use stairs to get aboard your aircraft, there are no Jet bridges. It's not a modern airport but a good size for an airport for Coffs Harbour."
152,256,"Coffs Harbour is a small regional airport which has flights to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. It features a Qantas Regional Lounge and has fast check in and security. The WiFi is OK, I prefer to use my data instead. Of course, it has a toilet and a spacious lounging area and a restaurant."
153,257,"Nice little airport. Hope they eventually extend it into an even bigger regional, possibly state hub."
154,259,"Quite security, good range of food and gift shops for the size. Can check in talking to a person, only screens."
155,260,"Darwin International is a good airport! What’s keeping it from being five stars is a lot of delays, a great thing of darwin airport is that there are not many lines/crowds for security and check in!"
156,263,Easy access through airport
157,264,Small and nice. Security queues were very long. Age of terminal showing.
158,265,Pretty small holding area for transit. Free WIFI. Expensive souviner shop with slow serice.
159,267,"distant from the city, not many facilities besides car hire and the odd food."
160,273,"4/5 here is why, The security was good, food was good the new terminal was good but the delay! Our flight got delayed for about an hour!!! I was even tracking it!!!"
161,274,"Getting to the airport was fine; there were a lot of car parks. Customs wasn't that fast, but it wasn't terribly slow either. The baggage claim took a little while but was tolerable. There are good views of the airport; I love it ????"
162,275,"Getting to the airport was fine; there were a lot of car parks. Customs wasn't that fast, but it wasn't terribly slow either. The baggage claim took a little while but was tolerable. There are good views of the airport; I love it"
163,276,"Nice small airport, Multiple food options, but sad that the domestic airlines don't use the new terminal extension when international flights aren't. The holding areas for when gates open are bizarre with just long lines to stand in and no seating. Overall a nice airport with great scenery and easy access on the 777 bus which connects with the G link tram from Broadbeach."
164,277,The international side of Gold Coast airport has nothing but a duty free & a restaurant. Eat food on the domestic side before you move onto the international.
165,279,"Very regional feeling airport for an international destination airport. Feels like a few departure gates, food outlets, chairs, and washroom fitted inside a big shed."
166,280,COVID-19 border force in QLD was seamless and travellers who had completed the correct forms prior to landing were able to move straight to baggage claim and to their final destination.
167,281,"Check in was simple and quick, however Qantas did not accept my Q bag tag as there is not a self serve bag drop."
168,282,A bit improvement from pervious weeks where GC Airport utilised the International arrivals hall customs facilities to check qld border declaration passes!
169,284,Loved all of Hamilton island and no long queues is hamo airport easy to get through and nice location.
170,285,"Landing may seem daunting, although it’s 5,800ft runway is very safe for commercial pilots Weather conditions average 15knots or more from the S or SE Lovely views on approach & final! Airport staff are super friendly & will help you in any way possible!"
171,286,"Landing may seem daunting, although it’s 5,800ft runway is very safe for commercial pilots Weather conditions average 15knots or more from the S or SE Lovely views on approach & final! Airport staff are super friendly & will help you in any way possible!"
172,287,"Withe reference to first review posted by Rod Adamson; Hervey Bay Airport (HVB) has always been completely separate to Maryborough Airport (MBH). For many years, flights operated Brisbane - Maryborough - Hervey Bay and return. Maryborough used to be the main airport in the area, but since the upgrade work at Hervey Bay, Maryborough is no longer listed as an airport."
173,288,"I worked at Hervey Bay when it was a one-man operation handling 3 daily flights to/from Brisbane (Sunstate Airlines), during the 1990s. I returned there in 2012 to find a highly updated airport with new purpose built Terminal. Flights to/from Brisbane (Qantaslink/Sunstate) but also direct jets flights to/from Sydney (Virgin Aust). Very impressed with the updated local Airport."
174,289,Actually Maryborough Airport.
175,290,Not very many food options in the terminal. But it is efficient to pass through and with no airbridges you are on and off the plane pretty quickly.
176,292,"For a small airport Hobart is just fine. The departure area is clean, with a couple of choices for food and shops. Decent toilet facilities. Really nothing to complain about for its size."
177,294,"Fantastic small airport. Hobart Bus Connection is a godsend. 30 - 40 minute journey. Very quick check in, security with no queuing. Departure lounge large with plenty of seating. A few shops and lovely bar overlooking the runway and aprons. Wifi is free and connects quickly and maintains the connection."
178,295,"Hobart International Airport is a small airport that connects Australia to Tasmania. There aren't many flights so book early or you might not get onboard. The food is good with a range of Cafes to choose from. The wifi isn't so great, it drops in and out. The Lounge is bland and not exciting, but is still decent."
179,296,Decent new airport
180,297,Good joint.
181,298,Freezing cold when you arrive in winter on a wet night. Insane that Australia's south most airport does not have skybridges!!!!
182,303,"Launceston is certainly very well equipped for a regional airport, however it still lacks a lot of comforts expected in an airport. In saying that, it has more services than Canberra Airport so it has that going for it. Food services were limited to a bar/cafe and the Gates were rather small. There's also no public transport to the Airport, instead requiring shuttle buses or private transport."
183,304,"Arriving in Launceston was simple, though I would not have liked to land on a rainy day. Open tarmac boarding, only 2 baggage claim belts (which were small too), no retail in arrival. Also no public transport is available to the airport, only a handful of shuttle buses."
184,305,"Beautiful airport. Easy check in, security is a breeze and they also have the qantas regional lounge to wait in."
185,306,Great airport for a small city with a modern waiting area and great views of the surrounding countryside.
186,307,"Great little country town airport. It's a fair way outside of the city, but easy to get to via a new highway interchange. There is a convenient petrol station just before the airport for refueling your hire car. Parking is easy. The check-in area is small, and the counters only open 1.5 to 2 hours before each flight on Virgin, Qantas, and Jetstar. There is a toilet and a shower available pre-security, and a small seating area, but not much else. Security is quick and easy; you can go through even if you're not travelling. Once inside, it's a really nice space. There is a store featuring general newstand merchandise but also Tasmanian goods - from candy and cheeses to wines and spirits and woolen goods. There are two coffee shops, and also a James Boag's bar/restaurant, which has a good selection of drinks and decent bar food. There are four gates downstairs, with additional seating areas. Arrivals and departures are separated like an international airport would be; this is likely because arriving in Tasmania you have a biosecurity check - little beagles sniffing your bags as you come through. All in all, a good little airport to get you to and from Tasmania."
187,308,Good for a regional airport. No public transport available. Only a 15 to 20 minute drive to city centre.
188,309,"Launceston is undertaking a bit of a growth spurt at the moment. The renovation started a few years ago with new luggage carousels and from there an expansion to the departure gates and finally this year more cafes and shopping opportunities. One thing I always find to be a shortcoming is there is only one security line and when there are two flights leaving with a similar timeframe it can be a pain to get through. There have been maintenance issues the past two times I've been there and we waited in line for what seemed like ages only to have a Jetstar flight push in front of us because they were leaving first, meaning another long wait. For a small regional airport it really is becoming quite a nice airport to visit, if only they can smooth out the security issues."
189,310,"Launceston is a small regional airport which has undergone quite a bit of refurbishment over the past few years and is continuing as I write this in Aug 2015. The terminal has had a facelift with the addition of baggage carousels, better arrival and departure gates and increased refreshment access. The stumbling point can often be security with just the one security entry, if you are unlucky to arrive when two aircraft are departing it can become quite a bottleneck. Car parking has been increased and long term parking although expensive is still quite reasonable, for example it is often cheaper to park you car than it is to get a taxi to and from the airport, depending on the length of your trip of course. The airports web page has a handy long and short term car parking calculator which I encourage you to use if you are thinking of driving to the airport. Current 'works' may cause some delays but when it's all finished it will be an A class regional airport."
190,311,Good for a regional Australian airport. Not accessible via public transport so either taxi or hotel transfer bus if they have one. Airport less than twenty minutes from CBD so short travel and relatively cheap taxi.
191,312,"Quite a small airport, parking prices are very good. A cafe, 2 coffee shops, newsagency and gift shop is all it needs inside. A very good airport."
192,317,I wasn't here for long and this was only a layover for me but it seems good enough for a regional airport.
193,318,"It's a usual domestic airport. One terminal, does what it's there to do. There are a decent bit of food options. Baggage and security is good and pickup and drop off is very smooth!"
194,319,"Nice airport, quick baggage claim"
195,320,small airport but nice and friendly staff
196,321,"Basic facilities, very few food options but food was reasonably priced."
197,322,"Breaking news from the world press is on the Global Newspaper news site. You can instantly read breaking news from hundreds of different countries around the world on kureselgazete.com.tr, and access breaking news and sports, science and technology, health, business and local news. https://kureselgazete.com.tr is a global news site where you can find the most up-to-date breaking news from the world press."
198,323,"If you're going to the lounge, make sure you are 18+ unless flying with an adult otherwise you won't be let in."
199,324,"Very nice airport, great windows for avid aviation lovers. Good food and duty free, immigration should be quick unless its late at night or early in the morning. Baggage is easy to get"
200,325,"Really like the airport - easy to navigate and also full of great shops and cafes. Just one problem, it is a bit unorganised. As soon as you enter, you feel overwhelmed by how the gates and how many people there are. Maybe keep it a bit more spaced out. Overall a great airport."
201,326,Travelled to Melbourne from Canberra on QF1517 B717-200 Deplanning was Smooth had a 3 Hour Stop over in Melbourne at the Buisness Domestic Qantas Lounge Food was Amazing
202,327,"It has been a while since I was last in Melbourne departure hall. Some works ongoing but nonetheless, minimal disruption to passengers. Adequate space to move around and a good number of shops to cater to our shopping needs."
203,328,Checking in didn’t take to long and from checking in to boarding everyone there was really friendly and helpful so it didn’t take us long to reach the skies
204,329,Wifi requires a number of details to be submitted which is not what happens in many airport nowadays
205,331,Terminal 2 very good with plenty of food and drink. Check in took a while but security and customs were quick. I suggest getting a Uber or taxi due to traffic and lack of parking. Overall pretty good experience.
206,332,Avalon airport is a domestic airport with all the facilities that you need for a regional airport. The security line was long but this was due to 2-3 flights trying to get through security at one time with only 1 lane open
207,333,"Terminal is small, a bar and a cafe with very expensive prices, did not enjoy the airport experience."
208,334,"Arrival to Avalon was fantastic as you enter the building directly to baggage claim and can proceed directly out. However, permit check was quite slow and led to quite the queue build up in the area which with the space available, the room was only just able to accommodate. Had there have been an aircraft larger than an A320 arrived, it would've queued back out to the Tarmac."
209,335,"Although it's quite far from Melbourne city, the airport service is quite good. There is bus shuttle from Southern cross station direct to the airport with reasonable fare."
210,336,Very conveniently located . personally for me where i live its much faster however the distance to Melbourne airport is same but Avalon is much fast . Ample and cheap car parking is available . few flights means less hassles and saves time . Hopefully this doesn't get much busier:
211,337,"We use Avalon Airport all the time to and from Sydney. Its close to home and easy to use with new flights to Gold Coast, Hobart and Adelaide hope terminal facilities will improve."
212,338,"Pretty annoying to get to melbourne from here, much better to go to tullamarine"
213,344,Separate arrival and departure lounges. Good facilities. Also air force base. Hi tech scanners installed.
214,345,"Good small regional airport, although after renovations, there should be more to do at the airport itself. Feels a little empty. Besides that minimal delays and cheaper than Sydney Apt."
215,346,An great little regional airport. From getting off the bus to clearing security was 10 minutes. A couple of cafes adequately deal with the small number of passengers. A relaxed atmosphere and easy boarding.
216,347,Great little regional hub just hard to get to the city
217,348,"Smaller regional airport but very clean and modern, difficult to get to and from the airport and no accommodation within a 20klm radius"
218,351,it’s quite mid; you’re average international airport and this is coming from an 11 year old aviation geek
219,352,"Lost my camera on arrival , airport staff and security great the best ever they found it out at bus area where I left it when we went outside to see was our pick up there."
220,353,"A large airport, not many lines at around 11AM, lots of food and facilities and great to plane spot!"
221,354,"Very poor setup overall with 4 different terminals in 2 separate clusters, making changing between them quite hard. You have to get a bus from the train station to get to the T3/4 terminal and the T1 terimnal is at least a 10 minute walk from it own train station. More minor issues: false advertising - their wesbite claims they have direct flights to many more destinations than they actually do e.g. direct flights to BKK - not true. 20 minutes to get through security on my recent flying out of T1."
222,355,"For me its one of my favorite airports because the staff are super nice and friendly, getting to the airport is easy and its actually clean. The WiFi is good, the restaurants and retailers there are super nice, lounges look nice, immigration was long but still nice and the baggage claim was nice. Overall this airport is nice and I want to visit it again sometime soon."
223,356,Immigration/customs much more civilised than previous visit. Airport itself has had a lot of work done so better than in 2014
224,358,"Train line wasn't working in Apr'23, bus replacement. Municipal buses are not easy to figure out, and some routes require about 15 min walking distance"
225,359,Everything is very convenient and right there when you need it. The staff are helpful and you won’t have trouble finding where you need to be on time.
226,360,"QANTAS use T4 for their international flights and it's nothing like as well set up at T1/2 where all othe r international departures go from. Very limited facilities and only open when the flights are going. Although check in was dead easy you have to go through domestic AND international security which is a pain. Good news on the new train line to the City, opening 10 October 2022 - $5 only!!"
227,368,"Sunshine Coast Airport is a solid airport. The airport has undergone a big change developing / extending a new runway to replace the old, aging one. It's terminal is adequate for 2 - 4 departures at any given time, though I am a bit concerned that there will need to be an increase in terminal size and capacity to cop with the new influx of movements from Bonza. Thankfully on my flight into Maroochydore, I was able to see there were plans to expand the terminal and increase capacity. The facilities inside are enough for a couple hours inside the terminal. The viewing area is unfortunately blocked with gates 1 and 2."
228,369,"Easy security process with minimal queues. Swell cafe though is awful, burnt coffee and food that makes you feel sick 36,000ft in the air"
229,370,Seating is very limited with only one cafe. Their prices are very expensive and unreasonable however there isn’t too many other choices. Security was fast and efficient
230,371,The airport is very small with limited facilities. The few cafes are poorly stocked and overpriced including a Sumo salad chain store. Staff tried to be helpful but weren't as good as staff at hub airports.
231,372,Nice regional airport. Free wifi. The lounge areas could do with some upgrading from rows of plastic seats.
232,373,"Unable to dock at the terminal, bused to the terminal. As soon as we entered inside the terminal it was a crush of people trying to use the Customs passport e-readers. I took over an hour to pass customs and join the huge lines after collecting baggage for customs ..."
233,375,The lack of taps to fill up bottles is annoying. One of the toilets had a strange urinal setup that would be somewhat awkward to use and witness.
234,376,"Early Morning flight, got to checkin at 6am and was past security in under 20 minutes. Sydney has some good views, lots of shops and a couple of lounges."
235,377,"Hello fellow travelers. This is a review of Sydney Kingford Smith Airport. Quite a large one, many gates and many places to sit and/or drink, Kingford Smith is nice. Friendly staff and workers Sydney's Kingford Smith is well positioned and well tuned."
236,378,SYD airport is very good. Good services and excellent location in relation to the city center. Access by train is very expensive. T1 departures has plenty of shops and services of international standard. Arrivals also has a range of duty free shops. Border Force and customs work very efficiently.
237,379,The baggage claim was small and very crowded especially when there's other passengers who arrived and around 800 other passengers (on my plane) who arrived are now squashed together in a tight space.
238,380,"I have used this airport throughout my entire life and it is amazing and there are many services, everyone is nice and helpful."
239,381,"Took an Uber to the airport, pretty good airport, plenty of services except getting through customs takes WAY longer than it should. Also a huge line for the check in desk, apart from that, it was fine!"
240,382,"Sydney is very good for transfers, even 1hr 15mins. Bus to terminal bit disorganised, but other than that security and transfer excellent at SYD."
241,385,"Townsville Airport is a good airport. The terminal has recently been given an upgrade which has helped with an influx of movement through the airport post-covid. The facilities inside are sufficient with a bar, a cafe and a general shop. There is plenty of seating through the lower part of the terminal, though very few upstairs where gates 1 - 5 are."
242,386,"Townsville airport is a great airport. Although it's a reasonably small airport, its got quite a few cafes, 1 news agency (reasonable size), toilets and many seats, downstairs and upstairs. They also have power points for those people who need to charge. Going through security is quick if both sides are open, but generally doesn't take long with one side open. Usually busy in the morning on weekday flights. Staff are kind and always happy to help. As this airport also serves as a RAAF Base, you might be lucky to see F/A-18s or any other RAAF Planes, or Army helicopters."
243,390,"Graz is both modern and delightfully old-fashioned. While the train station is a few hundred meters outside the airport, it's easy to walk there via a paved, lit, and covered walkway. Just be aware that there are NO elevators at the station, in case you arrive by train and have heavy luggage. There are ramps though. As for the airport itself, the terminal is nice and modern, but also very compact. The airside is equally compact, and all gates are walk or bus gates. The business class lounge is accessed via a dedicated staircase or elevator, although the access is a little hard to find. Food and drink options are a bit limited, but generally of good quality, and the views over the airfield are pretty damn impressive indeed. Speaking of views, the airport has a freely accessible viewing deck on the first floor. No security check, you can just walk straight out. More airports should have that!"
244,391,Small - fast!
245,392,Excellent airport!
246,393,Nice SMALL airport!
247,394,"Very nice, small and well organized airport. No direct train connection, but in 10min walking distance."
248,395,Nice airport
249,396,"Longest time at security and no fast track, but best and cosiest star alliance lounge in the network!"
250,397,It is a very small airport but still cosy and enjoyable. A small duty free area as soon as you entered was available and baggage claim was quick and easy.
251,398,"If flight arrival in evening is delayed and last bus missed closely, that last bus SHOULD have to wait for approx. 50 passengers. Also, there were only some 4-5 taxis for those at least 50 passengers, hence huge cues and waiting times. Generally, very bad organisation."
252,400,"Small regional airport, which is beautiful located in the heart of the alps and stunning views... Everything you need for a smooth departure - quick, friendly check-in staff - definitely coming back again!"
253,401,"I wasn't expecting much as it is very small but it was totally what I expected. Not somewhere I'd want to be for 3 or 4 hours but an efficient airport with absolutely breathtaking views. The terrace to watch the planes from is amazing with the backdrop of the Alps. Not much to do apart from a small shop air side and a very small cafe. Easy access to the main town, bus F takes you from the terminal straight to the centre or Innsbruck in 20 mins. No hassle!"
254,402,"It is not a big airport but got everything you need. It's in Austria so I was used to the high prices already. Nice and clean airport in a beautiful city that's a few minutes away. It's located between the mountains, which is amazing to see while landing."
255,403,Delayed due fog.
256,405,"Windy landing, uncomfortable approach"
257,406,"Small airport with few flight per day and at the terminal everything is at short distance. Bag drop, security check and border control is very fast and staff is very friendly. Only one small duty free shop, but that's because whole airport is small. Parking is cheap in comparison with other Austrian airports."
258,407,"For a small airport, it has everything required. It is a short busride from town center, but no rail connection. There is a small retail outlet directly between security control and the departure gate. A small baggage reclaim area leads directly to a taxi rank. Clean and staff are usually pleasant."
259,408,"Very small but friendly airport. Landing approach is amazing, wait times are very short. wish there were more connections to 1-2 hour destinations. great landscape and surrounding. don't expect super fancy facilties though."
260,409,"SMALL AND NICE, GREAT VIEW!"
261,411,"Small Airport, very clean and friendly"
262,413,"Regional airport, connected to many destinations through regular connections to FRA. Short distances, quick luggage check-in. Security check <2 min. -> In short: very pleasant to travel from there!"
263,414,Reasonable for a small airport. Only a small cafe beyond security control but the restaurants in the main building are sufficient and provide enough variety. Security staff tend towards the friendly.
264,415,"My favorite and also my home airport. Fast processing, no long walks, friendly staff, clean toilets within 5 minutes of the parking lot at the gate! There aren't a large number of destinations directly from Linz, but Frankfurt opens up the gateway to the whole world."
265,417,"Very fast processing, 15 minutes before departure at the airport, still flown."
266,419,Own Charter
267,420,"The airport is moderate size, nothing crazy. It is neat and has everything you need, but nothing special."
268,422,Typical Austrian Airport. Good restaurant upstairs whilst waiting. The lady on the cash desk charged me €256:00 instead of €26:60 which I did not notice until I got my credit card bill! Contacted the airport by email and got the difference refunded without any problem - nice.
269,423,"As always, arrive, a short walk across the runway and you're at the baggage carousel. Then another 5 minutes and you are standing in front of the airport. It doesn't get any better!"
270,425,"After the construction of a small lounge for Staralliance and Oneworld guests, the airport is now complete. The security for lounge guests works excellently, the lounge (although small) serves its purposes well. The rest of the airport has always been very good. The only thing SZG can't manage is prioritizing LG, AUA and AB."
271,426,"As always with hand luggage, getting off the plane is just great. Quickly across the runway into the parking garage and you're in the car in an unbelievably quick 10 minutes. Simply great! If it were always like this, SZG would be my favorite airport in Europe"
272,427,SZG is the perfect Airport for frequent Flyer. From the car port to the security is less than 5 minutes. Yes there is no Lounge for Status Flyer but it´s ok. Mostly you enter the Airolane by foot and this means you see the great landscape of mountains around Salzburg.
273,428,"Nice little Airport, bit hard to reach but it`s ok, really nice designed Airport. You have free Wifi, which is great. There are not that many food shops but the lounge is comfortable. It`s easy to get through customs and to your baggage claim. Nice!"
274,435,"Very straightforward! Arriving from the bus gate, we were dropped off right at the baggage claim. There were minimal delays with the baggage. You have the option to buy city train tickets right at the baggage claim, or you can buy your tickets at the train station."
275,437,"Self check-in is a joke. You cannot print bagtags or boardingpasses, so whats the point? Slow manual checkin Terminal 1 is nice and lots of space. Contrary to other large airports in Europe, the gates actually has sufficient seating."
276,438,At baggage (re)claim there were 4 flights on carousel. It is too much on 1 carousel. Also i think it is a correct airport.
277,439,"Panorama terrace is really cool place. There is a lot of modell plane on the corridor which made me so excited to visit this place. There is no glass instead of glass there is SRA check, so thats means you have to go through an addicional security check."
278,440,"helpful airport officials, nice and sincere crew, it was really worth it to fly through this airport."
279,443,"Incredibly modern and spacious airport with many facilities. Definitely first class and reminds me somewhat of Istanbul, but smaller. Would give it six stars if I could."
280,444,"Queues for immigration and visa check is too long, took over 1 hour. Transport links to the city are great. Wi-Fi was slow in the immigration area."
281,445,"No airport express runs between 11pm-7am, although the official airport website has the schedule with hourly departures throughout the night. Rather crowded passport control (only 3 counters), virtually all airport staff assumes you understand Russian and does not speak either English or Turkish."

284,449,"Very good, modern airport here in Baku. i think a lot of its customers enjoy it. Lots of food restaurants and lots of other good stuff. Very friendly, helpful staff. Fast check-in. Good wifi."
285,451,"Duty free is weird and usually more expensive than touristy downtown shops. Everything else is perfect: check-in, security, WiFi, wheelchair assistance if you need it. No long walks, plenty of seating at the gates."
286,453,"The outdoor seating was nice considering the heat inside the terminal. Although there was only a Dunkin, it still hit the spot."
287,454,"NAS has come a long way over the past 10 years. The airport is incredibly nice now. From the updated checkin area, security, customs/immigration and boarding area- it is extremely up to date, clean, airy and nice. There are a few amenities as well while you wait to board your flight."
288,457,nice that you can clear us immigration before you depart. long long long wait at immigration to get in thou! aprox 900 people waiting for 3 immigration officers! otherwise ok thou!
289,461,"The airport is clean and spacious. There are major food and retail services, car rentals and duty free shop."
290,462,Quick and smooth check-in and security check. Great terminal facilities and WiFi working even on the apron. Wow!
291,463,"Excellent new airport, not crowded, good facility, helpful and friendly ground staff, short walks, easy orientation, security with newest technology with no 100ml cap"
292,464,"Travelled to Bahrain Airport for a transit. The new terminal is very nice: easy, fast, clean and with numerous shops. To be recommanded!"
293,465,"The old airport is coming to it's end of life. Construction of a new terminal is ongoing. Facilities are outdated, but everything is quick."
294,468,"Easy to go through, efficient process, plenty of seating and especially the lounge was very nice! Looking forward to the new airport."
295,470,the airport is small and needs a lot of renovation and it need to be bigger as there are a lot of transit passengers laying down on the chairs . and the duty free is small compared to other airports in the area . and the smoking rooms are always crowded and the place near them are very smelly
296,474,If you are there for a layover I advise to go to the lounges either in domestic of international. They are x1000 more comfortable and not that expensive.
297,475,"be careful at DAC domestic terminal, a pick pocketer stole my wallet with 200 dollars in it right outside of DAC domestic terminal. they are a group of people. 6 of ours bags fell off from the trolley maybe they intentionally pushed it to distract me"
298,477,"Arriving Dhaka Airport is really critical, the huge traffic and vehicle security check at the entrance of the airport may cause you to miss the flight, it is suggested to try to arrive 4 hours early."
299,478,"Domestic Terminal is like local bus Terminal, only one food and retail service with disappointingly overpriced. Not much clean. Air conditioning is not good. No air bridge boarding available, only bus."
300,480,"Security check was carried out loosely but before boarding a screening was conducted, I was stopped and have to explain my reason of travelling one way from Dhaka to Rome. After the agent received my affirmed response, I was allowed to board."
301,481,"Since the Bangkok flight was 2 hours late, this cut short my transit time at Dhaka to about 4 hours. After deplane, I went to the transfer desk immediately to obtain the next sector's boardng pass but was given a Biman token and asked to check 1 hour before departure time. The staff also issued me a Maslin Executive Lounge pass but when I arrived there, the door was unlocked but no staff was in there and light were turned off. Instead the shabby Biman lounge, the manager at the Sheraton Hotel Airport lounge managed to accept me there to enjoy better amenties and service. SQ, MH, EK, KU also use this lounge in Dhaka. I was later invited to join the delayed Hajj Saudi flight pilgrims to dine together in the dining hall at the airport. Quite an interesting experience."
302,487,"Hi everyone! as a native getting to the airport was quite simple, though you may need to use a taxi or ZR to get there if you live/stay far from the airport. Check-in for American Airlines was simple and quick, though for any other airlines i'd suggest getting there early to have a seamless experience. Security check was fine so it got the job done but i've heard stories of people's stuff being stolen(?) so be careful and do a double check before to head to the gate. The Terminal Facilities are really bad and don't expect A/C in a tropical airport because you will get none. However there are fans. The pax info is hard to hear also. WiFi is alright but you have to be inside the terminal for it to work. Can't speak on Food because ove never had any there at the airport. AVOID THE LOUNGE IF YOU CAN. The food is not great and minimal views plague it."
303,488,"I got to the airport kinda late but in reasonably good time. Check in was fast and the check in agent was nice and we had to fill out immigration cards with no table to press on. Security was fast and I didn't really had to do too much. The departure terminal was clean and air conditioned. The bathrooms were clean also and there were water fountains around the terminal. As I sat and began to relax, boarding was called. Boarding was a bit slow but wasn't really bad. We had to walk across the tarmac to board the airplane by stairs."
304,489,"The airport is made really huge for no apparent reason. Everything is far away and under utilized. If you fly in from the United states the flights come late at night and the airport is almost closed from 11pm - 2am. However, during the daytime it is very lively."
305,490,"Great airport, friendly staff. Pretty rough luggage handlers. Damaged my case."
306,493,"Of the minuses: - You can get there by private minibuses, you need to buy a ticket in advance at the bus station (you can’t do it online). - The Wi-Fi code simply did not arrive. Otherwise it's a great airport. Belavia has self-registration terminals, it was very convenient because... flew by Belavia."
307,494,"There was a good gate, but it was not very clear where to go during a transit flight"
308,495,"just like in the 90s, you had to go through inspection and passport control again"
309,497,"Well, this is very cool airport. It is small, but that is not problem. The only negative is internet, not very good"
310,498,I can recommend the official airport transfer service - details at https://airport.by/en/tourism/transfer
311,499,"Decent airport, undergoing improvements. No train service, but cheap bus and taxi. Immigration not very fast, but the queue is quite short - airport is not very busy."
312,502,Minsk international is a convenient airport and not very busy. Always fast check-in and fast security/passport control. -- To get to the city use official airport taxi (about 15 usd).
313,503,"Airport without car is only reachable by bus from closest train station and does not offer much to do, so be aware to not arrive well ahead of time. Wifi is strong, security and checkin quite quickly. Boarding may be slow if another aircraft is already boarding."
314,504,"Fantastic small airport. Check-In and Security cleared within minutes. Gate 1 offered good views across the airfield, but limited seating, due to some form of construction work taking place. Public transport access to the airport seems rather limited though, with either a 10-15min walk from Mortsel Station, or a taxi ride from Antwerp City."
315,505,"Great little airport, very fast. Fokker 50heaven ;) Parking is still free but this will change soon with the expansion of flights going on. The home carrier VLM is a fantastic airline as well! Premium service for a low cost price !"
316,506,"As we were flying with a private plane from this airport, the facilities were of course ecellent. No time waiting, private check-in and security check, great lounge... When you're flying on a regular flight, the aiport is very convenient as well. Small, but fast. It's mainly a business airport so good food and WiFi, but less shops."
317,509,"Getting to the airport was fine. Check-in was slow and painful to experience, although it was made up to by the quick security checks. Terminal Facilities weren't the best, the same with food services. Paid 10 euros for a roll and also paid 5 euro for a 750ml bottle of water. There wasn't much places to lounge apart from the area where the food stalls were."
318,511,Quite a few destinations considering this is a pretty small airport! Not located in Brussels but Flanders. Easy to get to!
319,513,"Baggage drop opens very late, not too much time to spend in the lounge. Priority queue for the security check ends up in the same line as the non-priority queue, which is rather confusing. The tax free shopping prices are not very competitive here."
320,514,"Brussels Airport stands out as a prime example of a well-equipped and comfortable airport, offering an array of shops and services that cater to a diverse range of needs and preferences. The terminal's layout and amenities are designed to provide a pleasant experience for travelers. The array of retail outlets and service points is impressive, ensuring that passengers have access to everything they might need before their flight. From last-minute gifts to travel essentials, the shopping experience at Brussels Airport is both convenient and enjoyable. However, one area where the airport could improve is in its provision of VIP lounges, especially those accessible through the LoungeKey program. While the existing lounges offer a degree of comfort and exclusivity, the limited options for LoungeKey members mean that many travelers are unable to take advantage of this facility. The addition of more VIP lounges compatible with LoungeKey would significantly enhance the overall experience for frequent travelers and those looking for an extra layer of comfort and service. In summary, Brussels Airport excels in terms of its shopping and general services, providing a comfortable and efficient environment for travelers. However, the expansion of VIP lounge offerings, particularly for LoungeKey members, would be a welcome improvement, elevating the airport's status as a top-tier travel hub."
321,515,Well this was hellish getting here. Got off one stop too early on the train heading there and had to wait for an Uber to take me to the airport. Run like hell then go through the tedium of paying for extra kilos and the security process.
322,516,"Smooth transfer. Changing terminals was easy, but tedious. Not much else to say. Good selection of shops."
323,517,"I’m going to cut some slack to Brussels Airport as strikes happen very often. However due to strikes by AviaPartner that was not predicted, my two baggage’s were left at Brussels Airport for three days before I reclaimed them in Cairo. We were left in the gateway for ten minutes straight until an official came and told us no baggage will be put on our flight. My check in person notified me about the strike so we knew beforehand."
324,520,It is a joke that you have to pay for the toilet on the airport. I have never experienced something like that crazy idea!
325,521,"This smaller, regional, airport has undergone significant improvements since its last construction work in 2022. It does not provide a drop and go zone, requiring passengers to utilize the main parking area and pay a fee of 3€ for entry and exit, which could be considered relatively expensive. The parking facilities were quite full during my visit. Despite being crowded, the security procedures were executed swiftly and efficiently. The airport's installations were well-maintained and clean, leaving no room for complaints in that department."
326,526,"An airport that does not pretend to be something it is not. Despite its small size immigration was fast and baggage reclaim was also swift. Getting to Brussels is easy enough, however, the bus can get busy and you may need to wait for the next one."
327,527,"Well its typical ryanair territory, like 40 min away from the city, other than that its well equipped clean and fresh, with friendly staff"
328,528,"It’s a really good airport, check in was easy to find and quick to get through as well as security and they had a good few restaurants and a big duty free. They had a lovely little terrace with a bar, which would be lovely in summer!"
329,529,Belgian airport.
330,532,It's a small airport. Fast check-in. The Security check took 5 min. there's a small lounge at the gate. Overall it's a good airport
331,533,"All correct, but the bags are very damaged and lost!!!"
332,534,Airport whose runway was not flat.
333,535,Great Airport!!!! Good place for spotting and bussines
334,537,"Not sure if every time my comments overwrite each other but anyway...this place needs some work. Food choices are not good. WiFi ""exists"" but otherwise unusable. Hard wooden benches at the gates. Security here is very haphazard (they confiscate CHEESE of all things)."
335,538,"I know Belize is a ""third world country"" but tourism is pretty much the only thing they have going for them these days, having decent WiFi at the airport would be a big step in the right direction. This is my 7th trip in 5 years and it actually seems to be getting worse."
336,539,"Functional - this airport has what you need, and not much else. Inbound travelers won't see much of the airport - immigration and customs, baggage claim, and you're out."
337,540,"I've reviewed this airport elsewhere. Despite ""international"" in the name, this is a TINY airport with few traveler amenities. It has almost nothing to eat (there's one decent restaurant upstairs that can't be reached from the actual concourse). WiFi exists but not much more than that. Immigration/customs is pretty smooth - they get lots of tourists here. Baggage claim is simple, there's only one carousel."
338,541,"Phillip Goldson airport (also known as Belize International) is what it is - the only international airport in Belize, so if you're flying in or out, you have no choice. Having said that it's not a bad airport. Immigration and customs are usually pretty quick/efficient at handling inbound arrivals. Outbound, the airline desks likewise are pretty good. Security is a very compact affair with only a couple of conveyors and one full-body scanner, but I've never seen a line so I guess it moves along. There are several little gift shops and a couple of higher-end jewelry and liquor shops, but decent food/drink is almost nonexistent so don't count on eating at the airport. WiFi is present but usually so weak or oversubscribed as to be useless. In summary, this airport does the essentials (ticketing and check-in, intake of international travelers, security) quite well, but has very little in the way of amenities that you might be looking for."
339,546,"Someone said Bermuda is in the ""Caribbean""..the Caribbean is about 1200 miles south west of Bermuda, you are an idiota and obviously cluelss about geography...it is also 720 miles due east of New York."
340,547,A great airport considering it's the Caribbean but it could be better considering security lines take 15-20 minutes when 4 flights leave at once. The free wi-fi and restaurants are nice and the lounge (Priority Pass and others but no business class) was fine with a pasta salad and free drinks.
341,548,Small and convenient airport. Should have been a lounge for elite flyers who are not flying BA.
342,555,"It is a small airport that is improving the services, but it still lacks the organization to be an International Airport. The access to the airport is not the best one from the city, in rush hours it can take more than one hour to get there, despite of not being that far from downtown (only 15 km)."
343,557,"What a surprise on arrival couple of days ago to see a new airport terminal building finished within a year time. New departure terminal is fresh and clean, in a contrast with all other parts of the airport, which remain the same: old, used and cold. Service and personnel at the airport are better every year. La Paz and El Alto have together around 3 - 4 millions inhabitants, but LPB airport is of a size regional airport somewhere in middle of nowhere."
344,558,"Small and in the morning hours usually overcrowded airport without appropriate infrastructure. However, improvement is on the way and recently reconstruction and extension of the main airport terminal started. But, the early morning take off from LPB with mountains towards N and lake Titicaca towards west is one of the most impressive take offs"
345,563,This is the major airport in bolivia. It doesnt have Air Conditioner or wifi. It has just 1 small lounge and you have to pay almost a hundred dollasr to get in. The boarding to the plane was a mess.
346,565,"Santa Cruz VVI is acceptable. it's not a great place for a long layover, but it'll do. at least it's not cramped. it has an area with nothing but an unobstructed view for planespotting, in case that's your thing."
347,566,"The main airport in the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra is small but comfortable, I had a good experience in it."
348,568,Mostar Airport is a pretty good Airport ! Because you can travel acrosse the world with the line Zagreb Mostar
349,569,"Mostar Airport, a small, pleasent and friendly airport. Perfect posititon, 20km from Medugorje and 60km from Adriatic Sea. Check out Mistral Air and Meridiana fly web pages to get flights from Italy to Mostar. Visit www.mostar-airport.ba for more informations."
350,570,"Mostar Airport was opened for civilian air traffic in 1965 for domestic flights. In 1984, the airport became Mostar International Airport and was announced to be an alternative for Sarajevo International Airport during the 1984 Winter Olympics. The airport is also popular for people making the pilgrimage to nearby Međugorje. In 2012, the company had a twofold increase in traffic, making it the second busiest in the Bosnia and Herzegovina Kindly persons at Mostar International airport and very nice City of Mostar. Be sure to visit."
351,573,A tiny airport with a very poor Lounge. I believe there is only 4 gates for boarding. View is good for airplane seighting.
352,574,"Nice little airport with quick check in and fast security control. The airport is being expanded right now, but it does not create problems for travelers. I really enjoy the view on the runway"
353,576,"Small airport, connection to the city center is almost limited to taxis, be sure to ask the rate to the driver before the journey to avoid scams! Nothing bad, nothing exceptional, the airport has a fascinating story. Few flights, so it's not crowded and everything is quick."
354,577,"This is a small airport, and the fastest I have ever used. I was on my transfer car to the hotel within 10 minutes of leaving the plane. The plane landed right by the terminal building, pretty mush as soon as you're through the door there's passport control. Baggage claim is just past it and the bags were already coming through. The facilities are what you'd expect for a small airport, a duty free shop and a bar/cafe once you're through security. Change any left over money before going through though as there's no money exchange once you're through security."
355,578,"Small but great, clean airport. Love the position of the airport, so close to Sarajevo city center and with new freeway A1 to the rest of Bosnia. Only thing missing is strong domestic Bosnian air carrier to bring some competitions to Star Alliance airlines with still high air ticket prices to Sarajevo. Hopefully Bosnian Wand Airlines will become strong player at Sarajevo Airport."
356,579,"One of the easiest airports to get through everything is right there, no hassle, no long waits. Access is easy even when several flights come in at the same time (which is rare). One of the best small airports around. Its only problem is the fog (winter months)."
357,581,"Very nice airport.It easy to navigate,you can't get lost even if you want to.Nice scenery during approach and takeoff,Big parking infront of the airport.You can pick up your baggage in no time after passing customs check."
358,586,"Airport has everyhting you need. two giftshops two restourants and caffes,, two gates, and there is going to be built a new building much larger this year, so capacity is going to increase. There is wifi connection and food is brilliant. It is 15 km from Tuzla and 8km from Živinice towns"
359,592,"It's a simple airport, not many services, just basic restaurants and snacks available. No air conditioning. Usually very calm airport, easy baggage claim, no jetways (must be available on the new terminal, but the building hasn't started yet). It does its job."
360,594,"Santa Maria airport is being renovated, it is small but for the number of flights that the city receives, it is currently a good size, it just needs air conditioning as it is hot and stuffy. After the rain it gets even more stuffy, but the departure lounge has air conditioning."
361,595,"Small and beautiful airport, places of info, security..."
362,601,"Airport with excellent infrastructure, very spacious lobby, but the departure/arrival halls are already small for the number of passengers that currently pass through there at peak times."
363,604,"Very bad but functional airport, expensive things, few options. The boarding bathroom was very clean."
364,609,"Congested terminal. Aircraft out of finger. The buses that transport passengers to the aircraft are old, poorly maintained and are not suitable for those traveling with hand luggage."
365,611,"Despite the distance from the airport to the city, the size and space resulting from recent renovations are impressive, and the options for those with longer connections are very varied."
366,612,Confusion with baggage retrieval. I saw passenger suitcases breaking on the conveyor belt due to the heavy fall. And the baby comfort was on another mat.
367,613,"Airport with new and extensive facilities that provide passengers with more safety and comfort, both for those who are boarding or disembarking, and for those who are connecting."
368,614,"After renovation, CNF has everything to be in the top 10 airports in the world. Top 5 in south america. But it fails on adjusting the air conditioners... That is a big downfall..."
369,615,"It is a great airport since it has been renovated. Spacious and comfortable. However, the main floor has no air conditioning. If it does it was highly inefficient. Just terrible. Besides that lavatories are clean and well maintained. The subway sandwich booth had only very limited types of bread. I have, then, chosen the BOB´s sandwich place that was excellent. You get your money´s worth."
370,616,This is my favorite airport. I really liked the punctuality of the flights and the ease of check-in.
371,617,This airport has gotten a whole lot better over the last few years! Lots of food and retail options as well as an spacious and bright terminal.
372,618,"Good airport and nice terminals (if you're flying from Gol and not Azul). Luggage appeared very quickly on the belt, which is just what you require for a domestic airport."
373,619,"If your hotel offers free transfer, just use it! Or get a taxi to get out or to go here. You can try Uber but keep in mind that Uber drivers at BH Airport just accept long rides (and they don't care if you will do a very angry complain at Uber support about they refusing short rides or anything else)."
374,620,"The lobby was off and stuffy, in addition to a long line to identify before the x-ray."
375,621,"From arrival to boarding the flight, the airport has excellent infrastructure and provides excellent service. Very beautiful and comfortable airport"
376,622,Very practical disembarkation and the airport's infrastructure. Super cozy departure/arrival terminal to wait for flights.
377,623,"Brasília, today is perhaps the best airport in Brazil, but it is very poorly used, very good and spacious VIP lounges, large lobby, good access bridges, two runways that allow simultaneous landings and takeoffs. But it's a shame that there are so few international flights."
378,624,"Excellent airport. You need to arrive early as accommodations close to the gates fill up quickly and, depending on the flight, you will need to walk a lot to get to the terminal."
379,625,"Very clean and modern. Good facilities, wi-fi, food, and some lounge offerings as well. Within Brazil, very-well connected in terms of flight offerings."
380,626,"The airport has everything to be very good, but the ground staff is slightly disorganized, not very well trained, as some problems they don't know how to solve. Other than that, the airport is clean and well signposted."
381,627,"In 2014, BSB airport was much smaller than it is today. There was no VIP room ready or just one I don't remember but it didn't have a partnership with AF. Good connection with the esplanade of the ministries via executive bus and at a reasonable price at the time. The terminal lacked infrastructure, which from what I've been reading has improved a lot in recent years."
382,628,"Brasília airport is without a doubt one of the best in Brazil, modern, functional and with many options for the customer. (Connection only)."
383,629,"Brasília airport is without a doubt one of the best in Brazil, modern, functional and with many options for the customer. (Connection Only)"
384,630,"Airport with good infrastructure. Ease of entry and exit. Some work on the outside, which doesn't interfere at all."
385,632,"Viracopos IS One Of the Best Airports in Entire Brazil with 20-50 Azul flights per day, the Structure IS the best"
386,633,"Modern airport with well-distributed infrastructure, plenty of chairs and sockets for the necessary utilities for both those embarking and/or disembarking and also for those staying in connection, as well as many shops and restaurants to choose from services/products."
387,634,"Going to Campinas may be a problem during weekends if you are using AD Bus Service from São Paulo. Check-in were very slow making us wait until the limit for its closure and needed to change counter to Business Class one, and in the end 1 luggage stayed in VCP."
388,636,"Very good airport, great structure. However, the baggage return service left a lot to be desired, it took more than 30 minutes to get my bags"
389,638,Reaching the return point for rental cars is a true nightmare. Poorly identified and a very complicated way to go.
390,639,"Medium/large airport. Good dining options, although quite spread out, the conveyor belts only lead in one direction."
391,640,"CPQ/VCP is a small, convenient airport located about 90km northwest of Sao Paulo. It's much easier in and out than GRU, with shorter customs lines, faster bag claim, faster checkin, etc. The main downside is the distance from Sao Paulo. As an international airport, it's a good alternative to the much more crowded GRU, but if you're going into SP city centre, beware of the time it will take in a taxi."
392,641,The airport was renovated but they didn't think about making big bathrooms. They are all always very crowded. Needs a little more structure
393,646,"Brand new terminal, the old one was really terrible withou any kind of facilities. Now there's a good boarding area, with pretty fast wifi and two jet bridges. The only point that is not so good is the only food service available."
394,649,"Small airport but expected to grow in the short term, after all Cascavel is the fastest growing city in Brazil................................. .................................................... .................................................... .................................................... ..."
395,650,Airport undergoing expansion and equipment installation works.
396,652,"CAXIAS AIRPORT IS FAR FROM BEING BAD. ITS IS VERY GOOD INDEED. IT IS VERY CLOSE TO ALL THE TOURISTIC PLACES OF THE REGION, PLUS THE SERVICES ARE VERY GOOD, AND PEOPLE ARE NICE AND WELLING TO HELP."
397,653,This airport are better than ever. They are changing the terminal confort and the flights isn't cancelled too frequently.
398,654,"Tiny airport, suffers frequently with fog, and because it doesn't have ILS, flights get cancelled and the passengers get rebooked through POA(and then get to CXJ on a bus)."
399,656,Airport under renovation. There is no bathroom for those disembarking from the plane. The bathrooms are only available after boarding.
400,659,"this is the easiest, and quickest airport I've been too. baggage claim is fast, its never super busy, and it is extremely clean! free wifi, super speedy security check. there's a small coffee shop (and they don't super upcharge their coffee)"
401,660,"In my opinion, the airport needs more place (chairs) for people that waits for flight. Everytime I went there for travel, the lounge was full of people, and there wasn't chairs to sit. The foods are very good, but they're very expensive."
402,661,"New little airport, good coffee, clean toilet, many seats but the wi-fi system isn´t work and the town center is far from there. There is no public transport system to get to the town center, you have to pay 20 dollars taxi to get there."
403,668,"beautiful airport just a little confusing, there are all the girls from the airlines talking at the same time, you have to have your ears open"
404,669,"a little confusing, and all the girls from the airlines talking at the same time you have to be very attentive when you travel, but other than that, pretty cool airport"
405,670,Great airline option for those looking for regional flights in Mato Grosso! Excellent service at Cuiabá airport and Canarana airport (SWEK)
406,671,Too hot. Drink lots of water and use sunscreen. Fish restaurants and steakhouses always have good quality and reasonable prices.
407,672,"Very good airport! Good food, it's a shame they removed the cheese bread house to put in a lower standard one. No traffic."
408,674,"Very spacious airport, with food courts with a variety of restaurants, the terraces with panoramic views are incredible, as well as well-distributed departure/arrival lounges."
409,675,All restaurants and VIP room closed early in the morning. No option to have breakfast. All the rest is good.
410,676,"Very small airport, after going through the x-ray there are not many options for places to eat. We almost missed the flight."
411,678,"Good airport, access through São José dos Pinhais is not great, but inside there is a relatively good variety of food options."
412,679,Giant airport with good signage I loved some stores staff willing to work and friendly rating 10
413,680,"When landing domestically, access to baggage is quick and easy. The airport itself is great, clean, big, with a large window overlooking the gates, taxiway and runway. Functional WiFi with good speed and stable connection. Various stores and services, but they are also expensive in many areas"
414,681,"It is the best airport in Brazil. It is not big enough, on the other hand, very clean and beautiful. Good orientation with international standard signs, good internal mobility solutions and several transport options to go to the city center by taxi or coach."
415,682,"Good airport, fantastic city, excellent!"
416,683,"Curitiba is an average airport, which means it is better than the vast majority of other airports in Brazil. It is not very big, so it is not going to be a problem to move around the airport, and it is also organized and clean."
417,687,"We had to try 4 baby changing tables before one was working. Other than that, the airport is wonderful."
418,688,"Beautiful airport, nicely laid out, thoughtfully designed. The entrance with shops and foliage and a small tennis court (!) was fabulous. Great job."
419,689,"Terrace with excellent panoramic outdoor views, I recommend visiting!!! The bathrooms are very clean, shopping mall style, there are only a few seats left so passengers don't have to stand up."
420,690,"If you are renting a car, be careful to arrive at the airport with full fuel. The closest station is 1.2 km away and you have to deviate from the airport route."
421,691,"Florianópolis airport was very good after the extensive renovation it underwent. From a small, crowded airport without many options, it became a large, spacious airport, with dining options and with a good capacity to receive the tourists that are many in high seasons in the summer."
422,692,"The most beautifull airport that I've been. If someone takes a picture of entrance and tells me that it's a shopping mall, I would probaly agree."
423,694,"Public transportation is excellent, very easy to get to and leave. while waiting for the bus just outside the building you'll be harassed ad nauseam by taxi drivers. when there's a game in the nearby stadium, leaving or getting to the airport will be grotesque and chaotic. no free wifi, limited food options, hardly any past security and all horribly overpriced. there aren't enough seats in the waiting area. it needs desperately an overhaul. when there are military exercises in the nearby air force base (which shares the same runway) all flights will suffer delays"
424,695,"It's a very nice airport, but - at least in the summer - the terminal is almost saturated. The observation deck it's not that nice. It has a restaurant where you can see the planes - and the food is delicious! When I passed by the security area, it was very fast."
425,696,Public transportation is a pain in the ass.
426,697,"The entire procedure was super smooth and without delays or queues, with excellent support and customer service in all areas of the airport"
427,698,"I've been to Fortaleza before and I didn't remember the airport, which is beautiful and functional."
428,699,"Fortaleza airport is well located within the city and there is a good offer of transport (bus, subway (a little further away), Apps and taxi) to reach the city center and the best known urban beaches (Iracema and Beira-Mar). ). The airport itself has options for meals and is well managed by the concessionaire company."
429,700,"Great location, good beaches. However, with the pandemic, things here are very limited... I recommend going to restaurants famous for seafood-based food, eating crab on the beach is the best!"
430,701,Fortaleza underwent a mega renovation and is now the largest airport in the northeast. Super courteous ground and ground teams. The wifi at this airport has to be super fast and efficient.
431,702,The airport access runway was under renovation (duplication). The airport access lane was under renovation (duplication).
432,705,"AIRPORT UNDER CONSTRUCTION, BOARDING MESSY AND WITHOUT ORGANIZATION. NO PRIORITY ON BOARDING, EVEN BEING A PRIORITY CUSTOMER. TOTAL MESS, WITHOUT GUIDANCE FROM AIRPORT OR AIRLINE STAFF."
433,706,TERMINAL UNDER IMPROVEMENT WORKS. BOARDING MESSY AND WITHOUT GUIDANCE FROM AIRPORT AND AIRLINE EMPLOYEES. PRIORITY BOARDING IS NOT RESPECTED.
434,707,"Small Airport with 5-10 Flights a day, received many updates and lounges next Year, good Airport all"
435,709,Small airport with only one international flight to Lima in Peru. For the tourist importance of the region and the triple border should be bigger and better organized.
436,710,"Very small airport, when you get off the plane, skip the temptation of taking pictures of the airplane, and go straight into the airport to clear immigration. There are only two officers to clear everyone!"
437,711,"Foz do Iguaçu is a commercial city, only the Falls are really a spectacle in itself, we also have the Foz do Iguaçu Power Plant, one of the largest. the Hotel is normal. To go to Cidade do Leste you can go by bus or taxi"
438,715,"The snack bars inside the departure lounge have very few places for customers to eat. The other services are well positioned, with plenty of toilets."
439,716,"There are no signs at the airport, it was very difficult to find the boarding point, I was lost as it was the first time I flew"
440,717,"The airport became better after the construction of the new terminal, but it still leaves something to be desired, the airport is more efficient, but the food area is still not so much, boarding has become faster and safer for 4 new positions with '' fingers'' however for the remote areas there is still no bus available to transport passengers through the boarding area, the counters have become wider and escalators have been added to the food court, the issue of parking is complicated, for simple fact that there is a relatively high charge for a space in the sun, the old terminal had small huts where the car was kept from the sun's rays, transport there is good, you can count on buses, minibuses, taxis and especially ubers, the terminal was a little further away than the old terminal, the issue of runway and marking remains the same, just the addition of new taxiways for the new terminal, the takeoff runway went from 2500 meters to approximately 2400 meters. .. with everything with a final conclusion the airport has become at least reasonable compared to the old one. Note - For aviation lovers like me, who liked to watch landings and takeoffs in the observation windows of the old terminal, or even relatives on flights, these windows no longer exist, that is, it is not possible to view the boarding area , unless you board a flight..."
441,718,"It's good, but Goiânia deserves much more comfort and structure. The current terminal needed painting and some care with the details and even the bathrooms, but overall it's good. What is reassuring is knowing that the new terminal will be opened by next year and should help a lot."
442,719,"I don't know what Santa Genoveva airport is like today, but when I was a flight attendant it was very precarious, it was hot, there was no air conditioning and the coolest thing was that we got off on the runway for boarding and disembarking. in a more normal airport without much to do."
443,720,Needs a better food court.
444,731,"JPA Airport is very small, so there are not many facilities, food and retail services. The lounge isn't so big and were very full on that day."
445,732,"When at João Pessoa airport, it was undergoing renovations. I hope they finish it so we can better serve you."
446,734,"Doesn't have a jet bridge, in a rainy day, you must have the umbrella give by airline to get on the plane."
447,735,"Very clean and modern airport. It's small, but on a par with the current traffic. I just disembarked at this aiport, so I can't evaluate other aspects."
448,736,"Well, JOI is small. It has some advantages, such no much time before flight to be there, but facilities are poor. Getting to the airport is not easy, not enough indications during the way."
449,737,"There is no view of the runway at any point, that is, a large window overlooking metal structures in the departure lounge!"
450,738,"I think they only offer flights to são paulo and campinas. The terminal is really small and lacks of food options. However, security check is fast and efficient due to the few flights a day."
451,739,"The new technologies implemented have improved flight punctuality, in addition to contributing to fewer flights being cancelled. Although small, it is a cozy place. The access avenue, Santos Dumont, was doubled and an elevated road along its section is being built, reducing travel time. Snack bars, bank terminals, car rentals, crucial establishments at an airport are present. It has improved a lot!"
452,740,"The street leading to the airport was doubled and finally access is much better. Check-in was a little slow, as there were more flights and they were full, there could have been more counters. The Federal Police were extremely quick in their inspection, the terminal offers an ATM, which I see is crucial at an airport. There is no Wi-Fi, a shame. Food services are also improving. The departure lounge could be bigger, on a day with 3 flights leaving in less than an hour it gets quite crowded. The new landing technologies installed allowed my plane to land even in fog. Over the years, this airport has improved a lot!"
453,743,"Wonderful city, beautiful landscapes, a beautiful lake, a variety of places such as parks, squares and at night, many bars and clubs for all tastes."
454,744,Small airport for domestic flights. No need to arrive too early as there is nothing to keep you entertained at the airport.
455,745,"Small airport, but with a good and beautiful structure and is very easy to getting to the airport. The airport has serious problems with fog and rainy weather, suffering from some flight cancellations in the morning. No free wi-fi. Currently the airport goes through good improvements."
456,746,"Londrina has a good airport, recent renovations have improved the airport but needs more improvements at check-in system, in the lounge and the facilities available to users like free wifi or electrical outlet for eletronic equipaments."
457,747,Good structure for a regional and small airport
458,751,"Modern airport, tourist-oriented infrastructure without all the traffic of a big city"
459,752,The airport is about 20 km from downtown Maceió and the roads were congested during my visit. One hour to get to downtown from there. Traffic was even worse on the way back. Very few dining options at the airport. Wifi is decent.
460,753,"Clean, organized, good space in the boarding area. Clean, organized, there are good internal space on boarding."
461,754,QUIET AND SIMPLE AIRPORT. ORGANIZED AND DOESN'T HAVE AN ABUSIVE PRICE IN RESTAURANTS. GOOD PLACE TO DRINK A HEINIKEN BEFORE TAKING YOUR FLIGHT.
462,755,Large airport with several shops and other services. It has parking spaces for cars divided into two floors (ground and underground). Security and baggage control are efficient.
463,756,"Manaus has a good airport, however, it was quite hot that day and there were no food options."
464,757,"Manaus airport is very modern, however, the food options are still very limited."
465,758,"I thought security failed in some details, I saw people wearing watches, bracelets and chains through the detectors without any problems."
466,759,"It was just a stopover, but we disembarked to change crew on the aircraft and then returned."
467,760,"Great infrastructure, parking is big and good, check in is very quick, staff are attentive, security is good, the airport has a lack of good restaurants which is a bit annoying, there is a good wi-fi service"
468,761,New airport and in the final phase of modernization. It's getting very good. Ample parking and spacious airport as well. uncomfortable benches in the waiting room and bad and scarce food.
469,762,I loved that turtles swimming in the fountain outside the terminal
470,767,"Small but funcional and straightforward airport, not that far from downtown, Uber is the best way to move in and out."
471,768,"Very organized airport, great experience despite being small for its size, nothing that an expansion can't solve"
472,769,"I always use this airport , that small one but very easy to getting in , to the gates and make chek in,the most important they have many flyghts every day to Sao Paulo and to GRU international airport."
473,770,It's a small airport but have everything you need. Fast and easy check-in. Very good parking lots (public for short period or charged for long period). Has only one negative point: just one place to eat (airport standart prices).
474,771,Small but excellent airport!
475,772,Very good and efficient new airport!
476,775,"Modern and very beautiful airport. Unfortunately, the departure lounge is small for the exorbitant number of passengers traveling there."
477,776,"The airport is ok. It is in another city just under 1 hour from Natal, so you need to keep that in mind when arriving in the city."
478,778,"I really liked the airport, despite the distance from the capital. It has a structure that leaves nothing to be desired. It's a shame there isn't a sufficient number of flights available at the airport. Government and concessionaire must attract flights to the city, in addition to improving terminal facilities. A direct connection between the airport and the hotel chain (mainly Ponta Negra) would be wonderful."
479,779,"The airport very good, new, clean, good restaurants the problem is to get there, is located in the middle of nowhere."
480,780,"New airport, very organized and very comfortable. Employees are always available to users. On the other hand, there are few food options, Wi-Fi is slow and there are no lounges in the boarding area. In the future, it has everything it needs to be the best in the Northeast."
481,781,New airport built for football WC 2014. Only small fraction of airport capacity is used and available infrastructure including shopping and eating corresponds to that. There are rumors about plans to make from Natal major hub for Brazil in future.
482,782,"A Nice Clean and Organized Airport, However Very Lack of Information, Leaving There at 04:00 in the Morning, and Arriving in Guarulhos at 07:40, My Opinion and There Should Be More Information at Natal Airport."
483,783,"Small but easily accessible airport, the free parking structure around the airport could be improved. There are few snack stores inside the boarding area, but enough for some waiting."
484,784,"Getting to the airport is easy, simple access, bus lines that stop close to or in front of the airport also exist. It itself is simple and very comfortable for a Passenger looking for a domestic flight, but for an international flight, it still needs improvements. It has some services inside, but could have more. As small as it is, it has a second floor with a beautiful view of the Patio and track. Regarding the baggage service, it's good. As there is no gate, boarding/disembarking the plane is carried out via stairs. Passenger traffic between the aircraft and the terminal is carried out in the open air."
485,786,The airport have much people.
486,787,"Palmas Airport in Tocantins, is an airport that is constantly evolving, with the objective of transporting passengers to their destinations in a more comfortable and safe way, located in the south of Palmas, with a runway of 2500 meters, this is SBPJ!"
487,789,"Small airport, not many leisure options! But functional and supports demand! The airport is also far from the city, and has few check-in counters! It also needs more flights, especially to the northern region!"
488,794,I loved Petrolina Airport. Small and functional for current demand. Now it's time to think about expansion in the short and medium term. 2 or 3 flights at the same time and the current size is not enough.
489,795,"Finally I came to meet Petrolina. I loved the structure of the airport, considering it is a regional airport. Everything clean, organized and working."
490,796,"O aeroporto é limpo, o check-in foi rápido e o processo de embarque muito tranquilo. Infelizmente, o terminal é pequeno e tem poucas opções de alimentação. Petrolina airport is clean and small. Check-in and embarking procedures went fine, as well as luggage dispatch. Unfortunately, the terminal is undersized and offer few places to eat or spend some time."
491,797,The Petrolina Airport follows the development of the São Francisco River region. Always in expansion. New departure lounge and new arrivals and coming soon and new parking. Petrolina airport follows the development of the São Francisco River region. New departure and arrival halls and new parking soon.
492,800,A well-structured International Airport. Workers were outstanding when my flight companion needed assistance.
493,801,"The airport has a good structure and has undergone recent renovations. But the lack of equipment for instrument flights is disappointing, especially knowing the conditions of the Rio Grande do Sul winter in the mornings when the airport is routinely closed."
494,802,Porto Alegre airport is very good. Automation of access to Boarding to read the boarding pass. I used the Mastercard associated room (due to the C6 Black Carbon card) Ambar room... very good.
495,803,"Large, well-lit, organized, beautiful airport. The airport's ground staff is very well trained and prepared."
496,804,"Porto Alegre Airport is very good after the expancion. Enough space, enough Restaurants and Snacks options. There's still a louge missing though. Maybe more Retail Stores would be good too. Overral very nice experience."
497,805,"Revitalized airport, new boarding areas, check-in and waiting lounge. It is expected that in the coming years, with other improvements, the airport will become even better, however, some areas are poor, such as signage and ease of access."
498,806,"I really liked this airport. Its structure, facilities, services. The administrator did an excellent job of renovation and expansion."
499,807,"The airport became a bit gray with the expansion, it could be more decorated with plants, foliage or some type of art that represents our Gaucho culture and marks everyone who passes through there. But I can't deny that it's very spacious and harmonized (in the new part) - looking forward to expanding the track!"
500,808,"Small airport, was undergoing expansion work. Very poor feeding area, without variety. Few stores"
501,809,Poor infrastructure and few food options for those who need a connection. Passenger boarding/disembarking is terrible.
502,810,"Overcrowded, dated airport. Very few options to grab something to eat or drink. No air conditioning in the main lobby. Pretty easy to get to the airport from downtown Porto Seguro, though."
503,811,"For those who like to watch the planes, this airport is terrible, there is no point where you can watch the flying machines"
504,812,"Very practical and easy to access airport, around 12-15 minutes away from the city. You won´t loose time carrying cabin luggage only, as practical as a bus."
505,814,"Small airport, it looks like a bus station, it is only international because it offers flights to Portugal and other countries in South America."
506,815,"Simple airport, but good service"
507,817,"The airport meets the needs of the city, which receives several charter flights."
508,818,"Airport very well located very close to the city of Porto Velho with a bus line leading to the city center. The airport is medium in size and satisfactorily meets the main needs of passengers, offering shops in various segments, clean bathrooms and efficient security control."
509,819,"Good airport, small, but very pleasant and well built, a good range of shops and restaurants, serves the city very well, just a flight to the center west. Good airport, small, but very pleasant and well built, a good range of shops and restaurants, serves the city very well, just a flight to the center west."
510,820,"Good airport! Comfortable, with several options for food, snacks and car rentals! They just need to improve the route between the aircraft and the terminal, I think the construction of fingers would greatly improve the flow of passengers!"
511,821,"Clean, airy, air-conditioned and comfortable airport! It also has two avenues as access options in addition to being close to the center! The airport lacks a few things: 1- Without a doubt, they should prioritize the construction of boarding bridges, as the city's heat never lets up! URGENT!! 2- A larger aircraft apron, the last time I used the airport I had to take a long walk from the remote position to the arrivals hall! 3- More destinations! The airport basically has daily flights to Brasília, Manaus, Cuiabá and Rio Branco! 4- The airport needs a customs office as it would have strong potential for international flights! Despite these cons, the structure inside the terminal still offers comfort! It has several options of restaurants, snack bars and car rentals. The terminal also has parking and a relatively cheap taxi to the city center! In comfort, the airport beats several large airports in the country, such as Cuiabá, Florianópolis, Goiânia, Vitória, Campo Grande, etc."
512,822,The airport is still lacking in terms of air conditioning. The air conditioning is not working. It's so absurdly hot.
513,823,"VERY EXPENSIVE, DESPITE GOOD FOOD OPTIONS. INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE DESIRED, MAINLY IN THE ISSUE OF CLIMATE/AIR CONDITIONING. NEW FOOD COURT"
514,824,"The airport expansion renovation is going very well. The improvement in several aspects is already noticeable. When completed, the airport will be even better and bigger."
515,825,"Airport with good infrastructure, but needs repairs to the roof near the panoramic terrace and some areas that are closed on the second floor."
516,826,"A very rainy day in Recife, we caught a ride with a truck driver to get through the flooding on Avenida Recife, our flight was delayed for almost two hours because the crew couldn't get to the airport in time, the city was in chaos."
517,827,"The Airport is undergoing renovations and expansion, which is very positive. He had a bath in the store and is very beautiful. The air conditioning is great, bathrooms are clean. Everything working perfectly. The bad part is just the visual pollution with excessive advertising."
518,828,The Airport serves as a hub for flights to numerous states in the country. It is already small due to the number of flights it handles and it deserves to at least have a Large VIP lounge as the number of seats the airport has does not meet demand.
519,829,Airport with a larger structure. Service from the team is good. Few options when boarding. Access compromised due to traffic.
520,830,"10. Friendly Service! Cleaning up to date, staff available for information and guidance."
521,831,"10. Friendly Service! Cleaning up to date, staff available for information and guidance."
522,833,"Everything at the airport was closed, I believe due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The airport does not have WiFi."
523,834,"We practically didn't use any services (no checked luggage, we didn't eat anything, etc.). Disembark on the runway, as the airport is small. Reasonable terminal for the size of the airport."
524,837,Excellent airport. Now it needs specific care to clean the structures. Lots of dust in various environments.
525,838,"Boiling, no AC, lounge was cramped and they shut down the customs for checks!? I didn’t like the experience but it might just be Brazil."
526,839,"Big Airport with Internacional Flights, Many Lounges and Airlines Lounges, Good and Nice Structure and organized"
527,840,Getting from Galeão to the center of Rio is difficult at any time. Arriving at peak times can cause your appointments to be delayed a lot. I couldn't access WiFi.
528,841,"One of the most important things to take into consideration at an airport is how to access it. In this, Galeão loses A LOT as there is no good public transport connectivity and what exists is VERY unsafe for passengers. Ordering an Uber depending on the time of day is terrible and that's what happened in this situation. I'm passionate about GIG but it's a very complicated airport for those arriving and leaving."
529,843,"Airport with impeccable infrastructure, food courts and well-distributed boarding/arrival areas. It just needs to improve in terms of Wi-Fi and cleanliness, which leave something to be desired."
530,844,"In 2011 it was still the ""old GIG"" and I miss the old GIG. The Airport, in theory, is more functional today but much less charming than in 2011. Nowadays we have fewer international flights than 11 years ago, which is absurd. I miss this GIG, that time when the airport still had great relevance for BR's connectivity to the world."
531,845,Galeão in no way resembles the Galeão of yesteryear and needs to improve. It urgently needs to attract new flights and airlines as today it is just a shadow of what it once was.
532,846,"The airport is very well located. But for long waiters, it can become a little uncomfortable, and there is a lack of food options."
533,847,"A good way yo get to downtown is the VLT. From the VLT you may take the subway to the South, North or West zone."
534,848,"Fast Check in and Security, beautifully located. Not all Check in-agents can speak english, a common problem in Brazil. WiFi time-limited."
535,849,"The airport offers a magnificent approach and take-off, has a very beautiful and modern departure and arrival hall with a blue sea scenery in the background, but the structure itself is small and needs improvement. I only connected to Curitiba from São Paulo - GRU."
536,850,"The airport offers a magnificent approach and take-off, has a very beautiful and modern departure and arrival hall with a blue sea scenery in the background, but the structure itself is small and needs improvement. I only connected to Curitiba from São Paulo - GRU."
537,851,"Super visually clean and good restructured airport. I liked a lot!!! Thanks for the staff!! The best airport to get to I have ever, ever stayed at! Cool temperatura all along this good engineered airport!"
538,852,"The airport is good, but the prices for eating or drinking coffee are very expensive and there are not many low-cost snack bar options."
539,854,Small airport for domestic flights in Rio de Janeiro. Great options before boarding areas with mall and lots of restaurantes attached to the airport. Small lounge but not crowded.
540,855,"Arriving in Rio de Janeiro via SDU, in addition to having a great view, means being very well located in the city center. In a few moments you will be on your way to your destination!"
541,857,"Exit signage for arrivals was very confusing, everyone on the flight got lost due to poor exit signage."
542,858,"Fine regional airport. However queuing for security for int flight took very long since only one lane was open. Traffic in Salvador is a nightmare so make sure to leave timely before your flight, city to airport can take up to 1-1.5 hour"
543,859,"Clean, organized airport, with several screens throughout the airport, indicating flight times, departures, gates and the like."
544,860,"Salvador airport is well located and has numerous municipal bus lines that go to different parts of the city, from the beaches to the historic center. The subway is also a good option to get to and from the airport. The airport is big, clean, has several stores from meals to gifts. In addition, it has free and unlimited Wi-Fi."
545,861,"Excellent airport. After renovation and expansion, Salvador has a worthy airport for the city."
546,862,The airport is far from the capital of the State of Bahia (Salvador). The airport is far from the capital of the State of Bahia (Salvador).
547,864,The airport was under renovation and in poor condition. The air conditioning didn't work and the place was a mess. I hope it changes after the renovation ends.
548,865,Airport was under construction at the time so it was not in good condition to receive passengers. Airport was awkward and the air conditioning didn't work.
549,866,"SSA is very good to planespotting, but the traffic is typically domestic."
550,870,"I'm a resident of SJRio Preto, due to the size of the city, there are few leisure options. The city's postcard is the Municipal Reservoir Park."
551,871,"The departure lounge does not have a flight information panel. The process is quite ""manual"". The space is good."
552,873,great airport
553,877,"The passenger terminal should be expanded to provide more comfort for passengers, especially when it comes to TPS 2, which is small."
554,878,"The Airport has to improve a lot in terms of its physical structure, lobby and departure/arrival rooms with a smaller size than the number of passengers depending on peak movement times."
555,881,"the terminal has evolved a lot, the service is fast and has improved a lot now with the opening of the panoramic view of the runway and cafes, a restaurant and the very illustrious presence of a Subway franchise"
556,882,"Sao Luis airport was also growing, it had undergone renovation but it was nothing sumptuous, an airport with little to do. Boarding and disembarking are still directly on the runway, which is really cool. Today, few airports can use the runway for boarding."
557,883,"Average Brazilian airport. Do not expect to have a very big therminal. Therminal is fine, is air conditioner, check in is fine, security procedure normal, a cafeteria in embarkment area, some few shops in therminal and in the other terminal that is smaller there is a fast food and a restaurant. There's wifi connection but is not free. Bathrooms are fine too. The only problem for me that there is no direct international flight from here."
558,885,"They will improve more facilities to this airport as two more fingers, a restaurant and other. There are worst airports in Brazil. SLZ has been renewed with a new lights and airconditioned."
559,886,"A very busy airport, especially at the peak business travel and leisure travel times. The accessibility to the airport is very sub-par without a metro. To leave the airport you are almost forced to take a taxi, given that getting an Uber ride is very difficult, and the 'walking option' is also not very recommendable. Inside the airport there are basic food services, and not many lounge options available. The security check is usually quite fast, even at peak hours. Never used the in-person checkin."
560,887,I felt a lack of food options in the departure lounge. For a 5 hour connection it was a little uncomfortable.
561,890,Airport infrastructure without anything to complain about. Check-in staff are very rushed and the x-ray staff does not help with bags
562,891,"Free Wifi for just 60 minutes, ridiculous nowadays not to have unlimited access. Few seats with power outlets."
563,892,"10. Friendly Service! Cleaning up to date, staff available for information and guidance."
564,893,"10. Friendly Service! Cleaning up to date, staff available for information and guidance."
565,894,"Always a Great Airport to use... Easy and quick... I did the online check-in in advance and if I did not, it would have been a nightmare."
566,895,"São Paulo's domestic airport already shows clear signs of saturation due to high demand, especially during peak seasons, and limited space. It would need an expansion and modernization in its terminals."
567,896,The airport was clear and clean. I was only a connecting passenger and was able to test the internet and look around a bit. The internet was okay and fast and you won't get bored with the many shops. You can also watch the planes taking off and landing through the large windows. (I was in Terminal 3)
568,900,"Copa check-in at the Guarulhos Airport use to be busy and complicated, since there were no totems available, only human process. Although, there were no lines and the process was faster than usual."
569,901,"When you take your baggages, you have a very long way until the arrival lounge, because you have to cross the duty free. This feature is weird and has no sense, because you need to walk at least 3-5 more minutes. There is not also a direct exit to cut the duty free or avoid it. You have free Wi-Fi for two hours, and you have two free sessions."
570,902,"Its always perfect to board in Guarulhos airport, terminal 3 is wonderful, big, spacious, very good experience, I love this airport."
571,903,"Arriving at Guarulhos airport is one of the best in the world, especially for brazilians, that can pass through immigration electronically, making the process faster and less bureaucratic. After claiming the baggage, they make you pass through the Duty Free shop, confusing some passengers."
572,904,"An airport of international standards. Despite the distance between the train and the terminal, the convenience of long waits and the 4 hours of free WiFi were different from a 7-hour wait."
573,905,"Getting to the Guarulhos airport is one of the toughest tasks anyone will have on their trip. Luckly, coming from Campinas, there is a direct bus that travels this 150-km route. But since the last bus leaves Campinas at 20h, we arrived the airport some 5h before the flight. Copa check-in process is completely manual, no totem available. If you can, do the mobile check-in to avoid lines."
574,908,"A very simple and outdated airport, it is past time to be replaced by a new one, but it is not chaotic, despite the little space they manage to organize it well."
575,910,"there are no characteristics of an airport that serves a capital, extremely small and without infrastructure, although the city is served with few flights, the airport could be a little better, and have a little more entertainment"
576,916,"The VIX airport is located within the city of Vitória, next to several points of interest such as the Federal University of Espirito Santo (UFES), Camburi beach, ""Pedra da Cebola"" park, Reta da Penha, Parque da Vale, among others. It offers good infrastructure both for shops and transport and services in general are good."
577,917,"I hope Zurich Airport implements a lounge soon! Anyways, it's an excellent airport with very good food options and a not so extortionate price."
578,918,"Incredibly modern, accessible and connected airport! very beautiful, clean and have new, large and safe runways for international flights and spectacular landings close to the sea. congratulations VIX!"
579,919,"The airport is currently undergoing expansion, with the construction of a new terminal and new runway. While this work is not finished, those entering and leaving the State unfortunately have to make do with a very limited airport, with few options for food (although it has been much worse) and an infrastructure that leaves something to be desired."
580,920,"Normal airport, nothing out of this world, small runway and everything enough to fly, without luxuries of any kind"
581,921,Great aerodrome just for the opportunity to walk through the apron en route to boarding. The passenger is able to see almost all ground operations.
582,923,"Airport very busy due to being closed for many hours, but due to the organization and speed everything went well."
583,926,"Good airport, as It should be for such city. Pretty fast custom and good overall condition. But no any transport to/from the airport"
584,928,"Crowded morning but was expedited as all counters opened. However, limited baggage screening machines and with large crowd, took some time to clear. No time for duty free look around due to gate closing."
585,929,"Very nice, modern airport, Royal Brunei Lounge is absolutely great (also great food), short distances between the gates,..."
586,930,"Small airport about 10km away from the city center and easily accessible by bus services from the BSB city centre. Buses are available during daylight hours $1, but if not you can get a rideshare on the Dart app (local Grab/Uber equivalent) for about $10-$15 to the city center. It was clean and efficient but there wasn't much food available."
587,931,"Fantastic little airport. pleasant layout and nice looks. When arriving avoid bottles in your bags. When I arrived I had two leftover water bottles in my checked bag. It seems bags are xrayed upon arrival. Mine arrived with yellow dot sticker front and back which caused Customs officer to point me to having my bags xrayed and opened by customs. This said, everything and all in this airport was pleasant, very well organised and the lounge is great. It seems there are only stairs to get up but *there are* elevators, hidden so do have a look if you need accessibility."
588,932,Nice airport but with buses not running after 6pm it's kinda expensive(by taxi) to reach in order to catch later flights. The internet didn't work very well either. It's suppose to be free but didn't work after watching the video.
589,933,The airport is fine with interesting architecture and design. It's functional and operations are smooth. The A/C was a bit too cold in departures area. Airport bus schedule should be longer(at least till midnight?)..currently there are no buses after 6 pm!
590,934,"Airport is very near to Bandar Seri Begawan city centre (approx 15 mins by car). Check in and security check is fuss free. Terminal facilities is so-so, partly due to the airport going through a major renovation. WiFi is pathetic, can't get any internet connection at all. Limited F&B options."
591,935,The airport is still under development. Landside facilities have improved such as arrivals hall and departure check-in but the airside departure lounges are still in need of improvement. The departure lounge gets very full if you are flying on a widebody aircraft and the single x-ray security check at the entrance to the gate means you may have to stand in line for a while.
592,936,"The airport is in 10 minutes walking distance from the beach, awesome! But there is not enough sitting area inside the terminal, especially because WizzAir has a whole gate area reserved and they don't let you in, only during boarding."
593,937,An absolute rip-off. Even by airport standards the prices in this airport were extortionate. €7 for 6 nuggets! This is in a country where the average wage is far lower than Western Europe.
594,938,"A really small airport. It is nice outside the tourist season but in summer it is a nightmare. Checkin employees work slow, big queues for the security check, rude security officers. Be prepared for a long wait and try to keep your nerve."
595,939,"That’s one of the best airports I’ve been, I mean the customer service is top I actually didn’t expect it."
596,940,"Very impressing! Immigrations/customs were very fast to get to. Wifi wasn’t really good. No food places, only a Bulgarian old resturant."
597,944,A new passenger terminal has nothing in common with what it was before. Pleasant and comfortable place. Has a special place for smoking after check-in.
598,947,"No public transport (taxis affordable though) and someone smoked in the airside restrooms. Single tiny shop airside, small cafe/kiosk outside. Efficient to move through."
599,949,"Very small airport with average facilities, a bit limited the choice of food services, but nothing is bad."
600,950,Lovley scenic and hastle free airport
601,952,Wizz uses Terminal 1. Very old building. Overall ok. Toilets could be cleaner Metro connects only to Terminal 2. Shuttle bus every 30 min. Public transport also via Bus available
602,953,Sofia airport was very simple and easy to pass through. Just a short queue at customs. The bags took a while to come through at baggage claim.
603,954,"I have not flown from Terminal 1 since long ago, but check-in and security check were fast and flawless. The queue at the gate was however long and the flight was delayed for 1:25 hours, so not the best experience."
604,955,"Terminal 2 is great, but Terminal 1 is 70 years old and only Wizz air and some times Easy jet fly from there."
605,956,"A bit hard to check in, but the terminal was nice and clean. Security was a bit long and tedious, but once you get past it, the gates are right there. No duty-free you have to walk through. The yellow metro line connects the city of Sofia to the airport in around 20 minutes to half an hour. Not a great selection of shops and restaurants in the newer terminal."
606,957,"The domestic gate (D1) has nothing more than a vending machine, overpriced pavilion and a few places to sit. There isn't even a toilet after passing the security check!"
607,958,"Really too expensive to eat there. 16.5 BGN (8,4€) for a sandwich, 8 BGN (4,1€) for a 500ml bottle of water!! Way overpriced. It's not normal that I can buy a good bottle of wine for 8€ at the Duty Free and, immediately after, I pay more than 21€ for 2 sandwiches and a small water!"
608,959,"Getting to and from the airport is preferable with metro, but thera also busses and taxis. Sequrity check is faster with passport."
609,960,"At first it wasn't clear that I had to be at the other terminal (which is 3km further). There was a free shuttle, but the diesel van caused for a headache as engine was running while waiting to leave. For the rest very good airport with nice scenery"
610,963,Very small and nice airport. It has some restaurants and shops. If you are waiting for 30 minutes it's perfect
611,964,Very clean and well maintained airport. Everything works and happens quickly.
612,965,"Little, but nice airport. There is McDonalds inside and some cozy cafes, also there is a little terrace outside after check-in."
613,966,"The best airport I've ever seen. Clean, large, not crowded. Bus 409 goes straight to the city and can be caught right in front of the airport. The bar with the terrace on the slopes is a nice touch."
614,967,"It's home! Also, it has a brand new main terminal building which is quite good for the overall standards in this area of the world."

616,971,"I am really missing the terrace, like it was in the old terminal. During the early 90s there was a pastry shop with public access and one could watch planes while there. There is now an old ""abandoned"" Tupolev 154M (reg. LZ-MIV), which is getting rustier every day. It should be put outside the fence, just next to the entrance of the new terminal."
617,974,"Pretty poor during COVID. People were friendly but slightly disorganised, it felt dirty and I wouldn't have minded normally but with a global pandemic going about I was very wary about where I was and what I touched. Covid tests were rough, industrial like: we were lined up and marked on paper and then fed into queues to have a massive cotton swab stuck up our noses and twisted violently, much larger than the ones in Malaysia. Pretty average normally, here I would go so far as to call it traumarising."
618,975,"Small and friendly airport, even immigration officials smiling, security control staff helpfull and polite"
619,976,"Traffics from downtown to airport was quite bad at sometime, especially on Friday's evening. Better to arrived airport at least 3hrs before departure time."
620,977,"Overall a good airport. It's small, and quiet outside of peak hour times. The security members are somewhat unfriendly and can shout at you sometimes. Apart from that, good airport."
621,978,"Traffic to airport was a nightmare, check in was very slow, even in business class counter. But airport facility is not bad."
622,979,Basic airport with a few shops within domestic departures. Security was also small but seemed efficient
623,980,"Very, very long lines to check in, but otherwise great little airport! Nice restaurants.Quick and easy customs on arrival and retrieval of baggage."
624,983,Immigration staff are corrupt
625,985,"Small arrival airport with nothing but immigration/passport control, baggage claim, and customs. The staff are slightly rude and they don't talk much but over all it was a fast smooth process. The departing part is separate and is slightly larger and does have some food and shops to visit."
626,986,"Small arrival airport with nothing but immigration/passport control, baggage claim, and customs.

633,993,"Immigration/customs takes a long time. Forms can be filled in the airplane (if crew distributes them). Mostly same info 3 times. Despite long times, everything is very friendly and very clear. Since the airplane has only 50 pax, the waiting time is actually less than arriving on e.g. SFO or JFK."
634,994,"Duty free is highway robbery; in some countries, hands of thieves are chopped off and this should apply to Dufry management."
635,1001,Don’t Got To Thé Lounge Very Often When Flying So I Have No Comments On The Lounge For This Flight.
636,1002,"It's good to know for early flights that immigration does not open until 0430. Additionally, I see a lot of advertising for reducing waste, but could only find one water bottle filler, and it was out of service."
637,1003,"International terminal is beautiful. It’s all very spread out, and easy to navigate around. Lots of comfortable seats in the main area. Tons of food options in this terminal, even in the early morning when I departed. Facility is very clean, and modern. Would say the double windows do make it hard to spot planes, and the walk off the plane to customs takes a little while, but all in all, very happy with it."
638,1004,"International terminal is beautiful. It’s all very spread out, and easy to navigate around. Lots of comfortable seats in the main area.

639,1005,"Nice home airport. Facility was kept very clean, but the domestic terminal is fairly dated from the 1970’s. Also food wasn’t cooked from the Burger King restaurant, so I was scared that I would get sick."
640,1006,Decent over-sized airport. A lot of places being rebuilt so it actually looks quite empty but ran very smoothly with plenty of decent food/drink options.
641,1007,A very large airport with significant walking distances although there is an electric tram between concourses.
642,1008,Check in for US airlines is pretty packed as they have a smaller area. Security and customs is fast. Not to many food options but still not bad. Lots of shops tho
643,1009,"A rather solid airport. Amenities are all over and the layout is intuitive and beautiful. Makes for some good planespotting too if you can find a good spot! WiFi was extremely good, and all in all was a fantastic experience."
644,1010,Washrooms are clean and decent BUT not enough stalls (at least in the men's in any of the washrooms). I had to wait for the one or two that were in use.
645,1015,it is a great airport.Big windows for viewing the runway.Security was not very busy and food was pretty good
646,1016,Edmonton's airport is nice not to busy security was quick and easy I love the gates and the airport people they are super nice and friendly I recommend Edmonton's airport
647,1017,"Security had me mad. Everything was searched so intensely, like, its just a water! Other than that, Chrck in was delayed."
648,1019,A very user friendly airport with lots to see and do security-side. Lots of great opportunities to watch planes.
649,1020,"Have flown in and out of here Many Many times before, Check in is always quick. Security does take around 1-5 minutes depending on time."
650,1021,"Check in is very easy! Security can take up to a few minutes depending on time, it took u s 3 minutes to get through, it was 6AM local time."
651,1022,"An easy airport to navigate, right past security is a food concourse. There are many options for food and beverages. Good views of the tarmac is visible throughout the airport."
652,1023,Nice airport. Didn't need to try the WiFi so can't comment. Nice selection of restaurants and retail services.
653,1024,"Nice modern airport. Passed through customs, very nice interaction with the agents. Very clean throughout the terminal. Lots of variety for shopping, and eating."
654,1032,"My hometown airport, and where I first flew out of, so I may be biased. But objectively it does it's duty fairly efficiently. Any notable issues I've encountered at this airport were not fault of the airport itself, rather the airline or an individual. It's undergone some renovations/developments and in my opinion still looks fresh, and welcoming, even given its location in the middle nowhere among the Nova Scotian woods... The location of the airport is strange, but I can't say I have recommendations for better placement, so I'll zip it. I'll mention the Park & Fly system is efficient and useful, perhaps not as cheap as years gone by, like with anything of monetary value..."
655,1033,"Small airport, for it’s size, it offers a lot of stuff, location right outside of the city. Wifi is good, they have some good food, no lounges, but the waiting seats were comfortable."
656,1034,At 3:30 AM this place is quiet. Around 5:00a the shops open. Long wide concourse with lots of chairs with charging stations
657,1035,Very nice airport on the outskirts of Halifax. there are airport shuttles that will get you to the downtown area. Very wide concourses with lots of shops and eateries.
658,1036,I have never encountered an immigration officer such as the lady I had to deal with on arrival at Halifax. Her conduct was rude and highly unprofessional. She does not belong in a job where she has to deal with people!
659,1037,"Very small international airport resulting in a very fast, friendly and efficient immigration/ security process."
660,1038,It is a lovely little airport. There are a few retail facilities but mostly overpriced. Customs had a very slow queue so it really helps if you get off quickly.
661,1039,"My only real complaint would be with US departures. The US departures are off to a different side because of the US Preclearance, which is very nice. The only problem is that the two/three restaurants and shops that are there are only available at certain times. You may show up and have no food options."
662,1040,"Very poor AC lounge. Small, overpacked, and when more than 2 people are on the Wi-Fi it doesn't work."
663,1041,unscheduled stop due being diverted from yyt. westjet got us to yyt which i have to be thankful for. friendly staff and on time so what more do you need.
664,1043,"It's the perfect international airport, flight choices and times since the lockdown leaves a lot to be desired, but it's close and convenient if you can get a flight. The only thing is parking rates, last time I could fly I think I paid 65$ for the week, I decided to check the rates this year 120 for a week and 300+ for 2? 180$ more than yyz?"
665,1044,"I was flying to Las Vegas for the first time and YHM is amazing! There was nobody else in line at security, pretty good retail selection and boarding by a ramp is a great experience for an av geek!"
666,1045,Great small airport. Very efficient. Wish we could always fly from here when flying to the Caribbean.
667,1046,"Nice small airport and easy to navigate, very small line through security in the afternoon. The Airport is busier in the mornings as there are more departures. Only two restaurants in the airport (Tim Hortons and J&A Bar) as well as a duty free shop. I enjoyed the walk outside on the tarmac and using the ramp to get on the plane."
668,1047,"Small airport, however when there are 2 flights departing at once, the line to get through security can be quite long. But its a very nice international airport. To get to the baggage claim was very easy with very little wait. Hope this airport gets an expansion soon."
669,1050,"Nice clean, relatively small a/p. Handicapp people have special line so got thru security quick. Short walk to gate"
670,1053,interior looked unfinished
671,1054,"Neat little terminal. Not too far away from the city centre, friendly check-in staff, and super'b bar with good drinks and food. 4*"
672,1056,"Favorite local airport. Check in is a breeze, customs is quick. We have basically made a promise to never go back to YYZ after our first flight from YXU. The food was good, not too much to select from when it comes to shopping but that is just something that you sacrifice for convenience. No special lounge."
673,1057,It's my hometown airport so I may be bias but getting in was a breeze. Close and easy parking! Check in was slow (there was only one stand open for flair but it wasn't a big deal) still better than Pearson. The gate lounge is open and awesome. Great view of the runway.
674,1058,"Nice local airport. Always seem to have issues with security that seem like they require more training in customer satisfaction and how to perform their job! My wife seems to get through but usually has issues with her security check but I almost always do and I'm the one with every security clearance possible. Food is basic, parking is easy and convenient."
675,1062,"Great food and beverage options at the Air France lounge. Would have liked an open bar, since there was quite the queue for drinks with only one bartender but the food more than made up for that. People also actively spoke French which was a welcome change"
676,1063,"Nice, but once again there was a lot of people, and baggage claim was very weird. There were 5 trollers, and they decided to put 4 flights on the same one, so everybody was wondering where their baggage was."
677,1064,"Wouldn't recommend a long layover there as airport is pretty boring, Aldo our flight got its gate changed at least 3 times"
678,1066,"Despite being US citizen, it seems that it is still very difficult to not annoy the US customs employees. I got asked more questions at the US customs than I did at the Schengen controls at Paris CDG, despite being a citizen of the former and not the latter."
679,1067,"Insufficient pointers to the side ""Immigration room 1 and Immigration room 2"". We accidentally passed by and immediately went after the suitcases, expecting that ""Migration room 2"" will be on the ground floor. It turned out that these rooms were on the second floor. We have wasted our time."
680,1068,"Small international airport and probably not the most modern airport, but very efficient and convenient with only 1 terminal building. Check-in and security was fast (even tho there was a lot of people cacthing the delayed flights due to bad weather). The boarding area is also great, with comfortable seating and a great view especially for plane spotters"
681,1069,"Access to the airport is among the worst in the world. No train, expensive bus to downtown, too few parkings lots and very hard to reach with cad at rush hours."
682,1070,Hard to get it but it's cool to fly from ! Security is quick and there is a lot of things to do while you're there!
683,1074,"The airport was good. Wifi was excellent. I didn't eat food from the airport. I didn't try the lounge. Immigration/customs were fast. Baggage claim was good, but a bit slow."
684,1075,"Very nice airport, but for the size of the airport, the lounge can open earlier to accommodate passage that have early boarding times (My flight was scheduled to depart at 6:00 am but boarding was at 5:00 am and lounge opened at 5:00 am so had to rush to the gate."
685,1076,Security removed my dry spices from hand luggages. I am not aware that dried spices were not authorized on an airplane.
686,1077,"Quite a small airport overall, which makes for a smooth experience with minimal lineups. Would highly recommend."
687,1078,"Waiting for baggage takes a while, took my flight between half to an hour between us leaving the gate the the baggage exiting"
688,1079,"Good time at this airport. Fast , not too crowded and easy access. Could have more assortment of stores, but a good experience"
689,1080,"Good experience this flight. No problems at all. Staff was friendly and helpful, easy parking and no delays. I am flying to Florida in two weeks and look forward to using this airport again"
690,1083,For a smaller underserved city airport it provides everything you need. Checkin and security is usually fast and easy. Staff are helpful. It's modern has clean bathrooms and most restaurants are open till 11:00 pm. Usually up to the last flight. Upon arrival quick and easy to get to the carousels and luggage usually arrives within 10 or 15 min.
691,1085,"Travel at the time off covid19. This airport was dead! Everything was CLOSED. Not even a shop was open to buy a soda, water or anything for your trip. I just wish they had set up on display available for the passengers when departing."
692,1086,"There limited food options. No coffee shop on arrivals or food to eat. Starbucks is very slow service and terrible coffee.. Security is slow, be there early to go through security. Bus service is every 1/2 hour, taxi are expensive."
693,1087,"Nicely laid out airport, but security was very slow in processing passengers. It was late in the evening an not much happening, should have had more agents processing passengers thru security. Airport needs more shops. There’s no coffee shop or food shops to buy water or food when my family drop me off at departures. Very terrible for someone who wants to get water etc."
694,1088,Small airport on a human scale. A bit of a wait for baggage claim. Very nice agents. Clean lobby
695,1089,"Québec is an impressive airport for the small size it has. Not many food stores but just enough. The access is easy and will be even more after the finalization of the new parking area. The VIP lounge is really nice, imtimate and offering a great view on the airfield."
696,1090,very enjoyable for a small airport - good food too
697,1091,"Very small airport, with only about 10 gates. The experience is not that bad, unless its busy, which happens often. It takes only a couple flights for the whole airport, especially the security check to become very crowded and congested."
698,1093,Small but quick and nice.
699,1094,Friendly and fast - typical a small and local airport
700,1099,Very nice small airport. When I last came here it was under some upgrades. It was very quiet and clean. the location of car rentals and baggage carousel were in an odd place. The staff did not seem too happy that day. Very quick to get through both ways. Just minutes from the downtown.
701,1100,"There is a city bus to the airport but it is a hike to the terminal, which is no good if you have a lot of luggage or the weather is bad. Therefore you need a ride from a friend or relative or cab min. $20.00. Check-in area is a good size. Security check area is tiny, not much room to get dressed again after check. Only snacks/coffee available after security. The gate area is quite small. There is a small Newfoundland product kiosk selling neat local items. Everyone is quite friendly!"
702,1101,"Great airport, arrival and departure is really easy and laid back. Baggage claim is pretty brutal though, waited 30 mins to get our 1 checked bag!"
703,1106,"Nice and clean airport, easy to get to from Toronto and nice little tunnel to get there instead of a ferry but there aren't enough things to do in the lounge and tables to sit"
704,1107,"Beautiful views of Toronto and convenient getting there. Would be nice if they had us customs preclearance, and dont even get me started on how amazing letting jets would be"
705,1108,"Very nice airport. It has fast check in, security, customs, and baggage. It was a little hard to navigate my way from the plane to the terminal especially with all the glass. Wifi was free and fast and food was free (but i heard it is not anymore)."
706,1109,"I liked it better when porter offered free snacks, coffee and soft drinks. Now its just a big waiting room with opportunities to be separated from your money."
707,1110,"This airport is such a breeze. Wish there was an easier connection to the GO Train, but the shuttle is OK"
708,1111,"Small airport just 2km from downtown, so access is very convenient. The new tunnel makes the trip faster, without having to wait for the ferry. On the other hand, the departure lounge is really small, it gets overcrowded if one or two flights are delayed. The departures display was not kept up to date, as the person managing it had also to deal with the announcements and rerouted passengers..."
709,1112,"Awesome City! Very clean, especially the Toronto Islands and the CN Tower a must-see. For aviation enthusiasts like me it is also absolutely an amazing experience flying with Porter Airlines out of Billy Bishop City Airport. You should definetely do it! Maybe on of the last real flying experiences in the western hemisphere"
710,1113,"It was very clean airport, free food and drinks, free wifi. All in all, can't complain so I guess that's good? Also free bus ride from the Royal York made it easier. I'd recommend YTZ over YYZ anyday hahaha"
711,1115,"Rare time where Pearson was actually fine. We went had a domestic connection, so had to go through customs, baggage claim and reenter security, but it was fast (probably because it was late)."
712,1117,"Toronto Pearson's Terminal 1 is awesome. It's huge and accommodates several wide body planes at a time. However during rush hours, it can be a bit messy."
713,1118,Getting to to the airport was kinda easy first my uber needed to look for a drop off space so we had to look. Then the check in was very busy so once we finished we went to the security and it was busy but it was okay. Then in the terminal there was a lot of stuff like shops I only went in 1 store. I don't know about wifi because I never used it. The food was ok I got a pizza and it tasted good/ok and for lounge I don't know because I didn't buy that.
714,1119,"Terminal 3 is a bit smaller than Terminal 1, so it’s a bit more cramped for space but just as good in terms of passenger experience"
715,1120,not bad airport. Nice people. A lot of option for stuff to eat. Wi-fi is great. The only bad thing is air Canada
716,1121,Help Fellow Travelers by not submitting a review and engulfing them in the vicious odours of sidh's fart
717,1122,"Toronto Pearson is a great airport, but make sure you arrive 3 hours before departure if going to the US."
718,1123,"VERY expeditious customs arrival process, baggage claim was busy but not overwhelming and bag was delivered relatively quickly. From back of plane through customs to curb within 30 minutes. Union Pearson Express to downtown was reliable and efficient."
719,1124,"Easiest check-in and security I've ever done. Albeit a quiet time (0900 at Terminal 3), still a very enjoyable process. Went to a restaurant at end of pier C where there were hardly any people yet. Food was acceptable."
720,1127,"We use the Canada Line to get to and leave YVR now almost exclusively. Air North rarely has any lines at all, check in or bag drop is a breeze. Security with a Nexus card is pretty quick, but the lines ups at security were pretty small regardless. The Plaza Premium Lounge once again was basically full to capacity, but the food was good. No alcohol this time!"
721,1128,Didn’t Use The Wifi So No Comment. Also Didn’t Use The Lounge So No Comment. Was A Domestic Canadian Flight So No Customs Or Immigration.
722,1129,"Genuinely an amazing airport. We went through check-in, and security very fast, even with nine baggages, and skis. Then we stayed at the Domestic AC Lounge for like 1h30, and then boarded the plane."
723,1130,Very clean airport. I highly recommend flying to Asia with this airport if possible. Problem is that not very accessible from Surrey.
724,1131,The flight was delayed by 1 hour and 30 minutes. The terminal was very clean and the seats were comfy.
725,1132,"Customs was a very fast process, basically ask where you are going to in the states and ask how long you are there for. Lots of food options post customs."
726,1133,I think it is one of the best airports in the whole world because it is very qwiet and you can almost fly anywhere
727,1134,"Very clean and fast airport, as well as a scenic departure and takeoff. The connection to the Canada Line on TransLink is a quick walk away and a 20 minute ride to downtown Vancouver. On the return trip, the American Airlines check in agents were helpful in checking my bag, CATSA was once again very efficient, and CBP was very quick with Global Entry."
728,1135,"Its a NICE airport and very scenic also, It's just a nice and convenient airport for connections or Stays. I love the meet and greet area where there is also a plane spotting area for passengers. Overall rating: 5/5"
729,1136,"Vancouver's Airport is the easiest and convenient airport I've ever seen, Its very huge and nice with meet and greet lounges and more! I love it alot when I go for a connection or to stay there. It is very scenic also. 5/5"
730,1137,"Victoria Harbour Airport has a free food amenity for all customers, check was very straightforward very short lines also there is no security."
731,1138,"Victoria Harbour airport is a great place to fly out of. I would do this over a YYJ flight to Vancouver every time. Walking distance from any of the big hotels is a nice plus as well! Crew is very nice, check-in is super fast, and the flight is direct."
732,1139,"Great location in the centre of town, lots to see & do, go there every time we visit the Island! The Royal B.C. Museum is well worth a visit. .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."
733,1140,Convenient & beautiful
734,1142,"There is not an Air Canada Maple Leaf Lounge at this airport. Aswell not alot of food options post security. The one restaurant has hot food aswell as premade meals such as sandwiches and salads. The price is quite expensive. There are 2 restaurants pre security, Tim Hortons and The Fickle Fig."
735,1143,"I loved Victoria International Airport :) It's kinda small and still limited in public transport, but so enchanting, full of art and decoration, and pretty welcoming. As an analogy to a USA airport I flew in the past, I felt a pretty similar environment to Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport (BZN). Aeronautical greetings!"
736,1144,A pleasant and comfortable small airport. A couple of car rental companies with great selections. Public transport to and from the airport is not straightforward - there isn't any direct bus to downtown Victoria or Swartz Bay terminal (you would have to transfer.)
737,1145,"This airport was recently awarded as one of the best in North America and it absolutely deserves that title. Small but gorgeous, and super efficient."
738,1146,Wonderful Mid-size airport. Nice viewing lounge on the third floor. fast and efficient. short term parking only 2$ for 2 hours and nobody checks
739,1147,Good small airport
740,1150,"There was lots of parking spots this time. They have stated charging for parking again....thats too bad. Air North check in was super fast, security was a breeze, no Nexus line here, also still no restaurant, though that is coming soon, and no Lounge at all."
741,1151,"Airport access via the Klondike is easy enough, parking is fast to enter. Check-in is usually painless, no more then maybe 20 minutes in the line. Security is also quick and efficient. Terminal lacks in facilities, but honestly doesn't really need them, as this will either be your starting airport or final destination. Only a small shop inside, currently. Can get some small things, but kind of pricy and feels overall a bit cheap. Wifi has gotten a little better in recent years, stable enough but a bit slow."
742,1152,"Small and usefull airport. do not expect too much entertainment there. 2 hours before flight is earliest, you should be there. otherwise the checkin is not open yet."
743,1153,"No wifi, but not much of a problem. You don't usually need to budget lots of extra time for check in. Security check is fairly painless. Vending machines post security, but you won't be there long (there's also lots of plug ins in the boarding lounge), and the restaurant is pretty good at breakfast. Shuttles and taxis are easy to come by, and parking is free for the first hour."
744,1154,Long wait because there were 2 planes!
745,1156,"Priority pass doesn't get you anything here. The airport overall is nice and clean, but needs cooler stuff on both sides of security. The old terminal was better."
746,1157,"Good, quiet and not much at all open. There was one place open this morning serving breakfast and it was a pretty damn good breakfast sandwich."
747,1158,"Flew here on a trip from SFO (Layover at YVR), food was okay, wifi was great. The lounge was also pretty good, and the baggage claim was easy to find and get bags from."
748,1159,"This is my home airport and maybe I am biased but the new terminal is simple, modern and makes time at the airport as enjoyable as possible."
749,1160,"Nice, modern airport, with decent amount of options to use when waiting for a flight, and a growing list of cities being served, definately becoming a good centre to connect in, very kind and helpful staff"
750,1161,"It is a long way to get to the airport from the city, it is - though - a very comfortable journey. Lounge is very nice, whole airport feels modern and cozy. I was waiting for my baggage a while, but it was nothing too bad!"
751,1162,"Pretty easy and cheap (one fare, not zonal) to get to Winnipeg Airport. Once there, they have a Tim Horton's pre-security so you can eat for cheap. After clearing security, there's still a decent selection of food options. Oh, and a quirky thing I thought really added a human touch: there's a ""hug mat"" that signals where you're supposed to say bye to whomever you're dropping off."
752,1163,"I am a frequent user of this facility and really appreciate the new terminal. It is spacious with plenty of choice for food and shopping, a new Palliser lounge will complement the AC facility and the whole set up is good. The negative is the sclerotic and indifference shown by the local TSA staff; the Nexus line is usually intercepted by others, there are often longish lines, with security staff milling around chatting, and generally it adds a frustration to the YWG facility that is unnecessary. All in all, a good airport."
753,1164,"New terminal is a fair size, I love the big windows so you can view all of the parked planes, and the glass walkways. I was very pleasantly surprised by this airport. I would love to visit this airport again."
754,1168,"Very small aiport, but more buildings are under construction. During checkin, the security people confiscated all lighters they have seen in X-Ray. This was the first time I saw that."
755,1170,free wifi on this airport!
756,1171,"The airport is small. Not meant for large operations, so I doubt it can handle more than 2-3 planes at the same time. The number of security lines is very small, and the process is quite intensive (even checking people after the metal detector clearing them) so it takes time. The border is composed of 4 boxes on the way out, the facilities are not many, but should provide the basics. Inbound, the passport control is fast (as long as your country is on the list and you bought the visa in advance) and you might be lucky to get from the plane to the taxi in less than 5 mins. There is not much to it."
757,1173,"Small airport, transition very quick on arrival and departure, security quick performed well, limited shopping and food but not an issue."
758,1174,"The security check staff was incredibly rude. They openen ladies' handbags completely removing things and throwing them back in with no respect, order, care and without asking if they could do so. Unlike in some other airports, they did not request for the contents of the bags to be removed during the check: they did it themselves. Very disrespectful. The airport is slightly outdated, as expected, but it is being completely renewed. The check-in and gate area was all modern and new, and it seems the rest of the airport will be all new in a matter of months, wich is a huge plus."
759,1175,"Small airport with a few intl. terminals. Three departure gates in one waiting hall. The landing strip is surprisingly huge considering the tiny volume of traffic they handle. A lot of charter traffic passing by. Wifi is horrible, but free. Dufry is ok, accepts local escudos and euros, due to the mainly western european charter tourists tagging along."
760,1178,5x B738 at the same time is a bit too much for this small airport. The terminal was really full of passangers.
761,1188,The airport only offers transfers for travelers to access the San Pedro do Atacama region (the main tourist destination that takes travelers to Calama airport).
762,1194,"Attractive and new-looking small regional airport. Decent facilities for an airport of its size. A little odd to return a rental car, though friendly and accommodating."
763,1195,"Terminal handling and airport management are quite efficient and the airport is clean and comfortable Unfortunately, as throughout this beautiful country, English was an issue and international rental car companies, which by the way charged a ridiculous surcharge for nothing based on a Spanish language laminated sheet of paper, airport information and other personnel did not speak a word of English. Didn't see public transportation, but airport is virtually in town although not accessible by foot. Transport to San Pedro de Atacama was arrangeable though. All in all, I'd say a well-operated regional airport where things go smoothly but you will have to be either fluent in Spanish or as we were well organized"
764,1196,"The Calama airport more than fulfills the functions of a regional airport, with some international flights, but it is an easy airport to use for the passenger (although with the security control in a strange place) with flights to several cities and well connected with the city. and with the town of San Pedro de Atacama (one of the main tourist attractions in the area)"
765,1197,"Airport is only for a flights from and to Santiago :) Only one bar/restaurant before security check, but you should find there everything you need before a short flight ;) New terminal is under constructions."
766,1199,"Carriel Sur (CCP) is a modern airport, very fast and comfortable, with free WiFi and VIP Lounge. It is very easy to get to the airport, you can take the BioBus (orange bus) from the city downtown, and they will take you to the airport for less than 1 USD. You can pay that bus with coins or prepaid Biotren card."
767,1200,"Carriel Sur is really one of the best airports in Chile. The terminal building is spacious, new and clean, it is also very close to downtown and the main shopping area. Good connections even though there is no bus or train to get there, only taxi or transfer service."
768,1203,Some facilites like bathrooms were unavailable that day. Gate No6 were not available it's speaker so they announced using a megaphone instead.
769,1204,"The fast food establishments at the airport are very poorly located, and very few... The ones there are are very expensive."
770,1206,"IPC Airport has little structure but enough to receive large aircraft. Basically, the terminal is prepared for the two daily flights it receives (at its peak, unless I'm mistaken, it received three) and little more than that. Due to the small size of the island, you can walk if you are in the center and for your needs the airport does the job. Negative point was the absence of wifi."
771,1207,"Bare bones airport. You can get excellent photos with your jet though, as you walk out from the terminal ""building"" to the jet directly on the tarmac and board via stairs."
772,1208,"On arrival, a big queue starts to form on the left hand side of the walkway to the entrance of the terminal building. This is for the entrance ticket to the Easter Island parks, and not any immigration or customs check. Unless you're staying at a hotel that is not in the main village of Hanga Roa, or there happens to be no queue, there is no need to buy this at the airport. The checked-in baggage comes through fairly quickly, so save your time at the airport, and just buy the ticket from the main vendor on the High Street of Hanga Roa! On departure, the staff were helpful and friendly, as are most people on the Island. The building is clearly not designed for a full 787 of people, and queues can get long (customs, then check in, then immigration). Tourists tend to get to the airport quite early, so to maximise your time on the island, try going 75 mins before departure, once most people have gone through the stages of the process. Alternatively, go very early (150 mins before departure) to check your luggage in, and then go back to Hanga Roa for an empanada and some po'e!"
773,1218,"To be my first time at this airport, I am really surprised. I mean, I used to hate Chile, but now I LOVE IT. I don't know those people who said they were scared of Santiago or the whole country, but man, this airport was incredible. Definetly the most underrated airport in South America. Definetly worth the visit to this amazing country. :)"
774,1219,SCL airport is reasonably good. At the time of travel parts of it were under construction. Migrations and customs officers are quite unfriendly and can be quite rude to certain passport holders. Baggage claim is rather slow. Services including food and retail are of international level and price. The distance to walk between gates and immigration booth is extremely long. Transport to the city must be booked before hand. Domestic flights use the old Terminal and they have reasonable quality in both services and level of attention. There is traffic at all hours.
775,1220,"The airport is very new, but it is missing some things to be a good airport. Outlets, store offers, places to eat, VIP lounges, etc. Furthermore, and something that surprises me, it is an airport that does not allow you to see the planes much. From the waiting rooms of T2, it is difficult to see outside."
776,1221,"Quite a lot of walking, directed to the 'old fellas' immigration window so super fast. SAG form a pain, should revert to paper"
777,1222,"I felt an improvement at SCL airport since the last time I was there. I still think there is a lack of signage in some parts, especially in the older terminal. Good number of VIP lounges and overall, good airport."
778,1225,I went through SCL nates of modernization works so my review is certainly out of date. Airport needed improvements mainly with regard to a quick connection with the city center.
779,1226,"The new terminal 2 (international) is very big, spacious, good food outlets and excellent free wifi, no time limit"
780,1227,"Check in is quite slow, at least in the American desk, security and immigration fast, efficient boarding"
781,1231,"Baotou Airport is not the provincial capital airport, but it is not small. The proportion of corridor bridges is particularly large. The restaurants in the airport are very cheap, and the security check-in and check-in are very fast! The traffic is not very convenient"
782,1232,"Baotou is not the provincial capital airport, but the terminal building is not small, covered bridges account for a large proportion, restaurants are relatively cheap, and transportation is not very good. The lounge is too simple. It's not good."
783,1233,"The new terminal building recently (Oct 2014) opened has improved Baotou airport a lot, however as it is a small city, services remain to be lacking. Little English is spoken, security staff is rude, facilities poor. Taxi to the city is fast, although drivers will try and overcharge."
784,1234,"Customs are ridiculously slow, but everything else is fine. With a wide variety of food and services, it's worth getting a look at PEK."
785,1238,"Peking Capital airport is a great airport, is accessible from capital express subway, airport bus, public bus and by taxi. The airport has all the facilities and the airport staff workers are all friendly and professional. Is one my favorite airport in China."
786,1239,"I like this Airport, it has all the facilities a person needs to enjoy a dream travel. It is big, with professional staff, clean and with so many ways to get to the airport."
787,1241,didn't understand a thing people were saying
788,1242,"When we arrived at Terminal T3 this time, the airport staff was very responsible for the transfer passengers. The airport baggage claim area was crowded, the waiting time for luggage was long, the airport traffic was very convenient, and the restaurant prices were not cheap. The facilities are OK."
789,1243,"Starting from Terminal T3, the facilities are very new, but the security check queue is very long. There are many people in the restaurant and the price is very expensive, but WiFi is very fast."
790,1244,"The place is easy access, spacious, some superb places to eat BUT the fact that both on arrival and departure they had one solitary person handling immigration for every single non-Chinese national was shocking."
791,1245,The most modern airport with auto-check-in and baggage service. The security check process is also very neat. The walk to the gate is of small distance even in a large terminal.
792,1246,"The first phase of the airport project is designed with a target of 72 million passengers,2 million tons of cargo and mail,and 620,000 aircraft movements in the long term. Technological features of the airport include radio frequency identification for baggage tracking, geothermal heat pumps for heating and cooling, and facial recognition security access."
793,1247,"Amazing airport, the design of the main terminal is truly breathtaking. It's quite underutilized for international flights as there are only a handful of international flights each day. Therefore, getting off the plane, going through immigration and getting your back is super quick. There are a lot of restaurant/food options in the terminal. And getting to the city is quite fast and easy with the Daxing Express."
794,1248,"Gigantic airport with no queue, a lot of shops and lot of entertainment. Not many alternative to the airport - there is metro or by car."
795,1249,"I arrived at Daxing Airport relatively late. The airport is very large and clean, and the facilities are very new. The prices of restaurants are the same as those in the city (which is really rare). Even though it is relatively late, there are many transportation methods to leave Daxing Airport. Baggage can be picked up very quickly."
796,1250,"It's a perfect new airport. There are many ways to get to the airport. I choose the fastest subway. The check-in brother is very enthusiastic. The security check-in speed is a little slow, but the equipment is very advanced. The facilities in the terminal are very new, the restaurants are very cheap, the WiFi is very fast, and there are many rest areas, which are perfect!"

798,1252,Was my second time to be in this world's biggest airport. it's amazing place to be. I like it. keep it up.
799,1253,"Airport access train was super fast 50km travelled under 20mins (fastest regular train at 160km/h), getting to the train station is still far from city center waiting for the extension to be complete. Airport was super modern, beautiful in terms of architecture. Check-in too modern, difficult for non-residents who cannot online check-in. Smooth access to security from train station. Great choice of retail and food (specially Peking duck), shops centralized instead of spreading in each finger. Big issue was reaching the finger, probably 10 mins walk from central area. Not enough signage either. The terminal seemed to be designed so that domestic and international can share facilities and gates."
800,1257,"security check area C was closed during morning rush hour. Old terminal building and long waiting time for security check. Also, lounges are small and few food is provided.(Expect CA MU and 3U)"
801,1260,"Shuangliu Airport is very close to the city, and there is also Metro Line 10, which can easily travel between the city and the airport. When taking domestic flights, if you take Sichuan Airlines at T1, the security check is very fast, and you don’t need to arrive at the airport too early, because there is nothing to relax in the restricted area of ​​T1, and the lounge is not satisfactory. After all, T1 is too old. If you are in T2, you can reserve a little more time. I personally recommend arriving at the airport 30 minutes before boarding to start the security check. There are more commercial facilities in the restricted area than T1. There are two Starbucks, and there are also MUJI TO GO, Starbucks, and Starbucks in the check-in hall. McDonald's, etc., and even a hot pot restaurant! Except for Air China's self-operated lounges, T2's lounges are self-operated by the airport, and the conditions are relatively average."
802,1265,Nice new and clean airport. Fast service when travelling international flight.
803,1267,"It's an international Airport in one of the biggest cities of the world and nobody, really nobody with got in touch with had any knowledge in speaking english. We had some problems with our suitcases and it was a hell to explain them our problems."
804,1268,"New terminal 3 is really perfect. Just the outside transport is not so easy yet, waiting for the line 10. The CZ lounge is much bigger than the previous one, however still worse than the CA lounge."
805,1269,Despite delayed flight from Shanghai guys in Chongqing did amazing job to do the transfer service smoothly and I got my connection to Dubai on time. Only immigration was really grumpy and they didn't want only 5 passengers to go through without long queuing.
806,1272,The structure is simpler than expected and easy to move. There are about 3 turntables where you can receive your luggage. The turntable in the back has a strange structure where you have to go back to the front after taking your baggage. Immigration was very smooth.
807,1273,"Baggage inspection 3 times. Before entering the airport building, before check-in, before immigration. I felt it was quite strict. I think the international flights themselves are compact and easy to use."
808,1274,"clean, efficient airport!"
809,1277,"As the airport in my hometown, it's a place to feel at home. (So I may not be able to comment on its public transport situation...) 作为家乡的机场，机场设计让我有回家的感觉。（所以我也不便对机场的公共交通情况做出评价。）"
810,1280,"Compared to other airports in China rather small, but pretty crowded. CheckIn is slow. Security check is effective and fast."
811,1282,"Need to arrive at least 3 hours before flight time if you intend to use the lounge or for a meal. I arrive 2 hours before flight, after all checking, it’s already time for boarding!"
812,1283,Security was really tougher at this airport much more than any other airport that I have been to but it was a good experience all in all.
813,1284,Security was crazy definitely much tougher than any other airport I've been to but other than that it was a good experience.
814,1285,"If you are catching an early flight at CAN T2, don't go one night before. It's very hard to sleep over the airport while it won't allow you to restricted area one day ahead (even though you're catching a flight on the early morning). Lounges here are not 24hr and the only place you can find is a KFC"
815,1286,"If you can, use the metro to get to the airport. The Airport Highway can be slow, especially during holidays. Terminal 2 is much better than Terminal 1."
816,1288,"CAN's international terminal is terrific with a variety of shops and lots of aircrafts， including A380s, to spot. The Wifi is good, but all shops close at am, so mid-night connection will be a bit boring"
817,1289,"The new terminal is very beautiful, with a variety of services and magnificent designs. I enjoyed a meal prior to departure, and that was also very worthy of the price. All process are done fairly conveniently."
818,1290,"Next time, we will take ourselves to the airport. The longer router, but direct router with less transfer is always best. Got up a 5 am to catch a 10:30 AM flight. Security check took 30 minutes. Had to remove belt and shirt, x ray our luggage twice."
819,1291,"T2 is amazing for both departure and arrive, it's very international and probably the best terminal in the world."
820,1292,"The transportation is not very convenient. If you come by yourself, you can only take a taxi or the airport bus. I was sent to the airport with a tour group. There were not many people at check-in and the security check was a bit slow."
821,1293,"The airport is very beautiful, and it also has the meaning of mountains and rivers. If you arrive at night, there are a lot of people. It is a tourist city. At the end of the peak season, the flow of people is normal! There is no subway for public transportation, which is not very convenient."
822,1295,"Very so so, a small airport that just for a little stay, the lounge is so small, and food is not good. Will not come again, not like Guilin so much. So many cheating and the travel business does too good here. I don't like here any more, not beautiful, everywhere is a construction place."
823,1300,"Hailar airport is relatively large among the small airports. It has more parking spaces and taxiways with the same length as the runway. The security check is very fast. The airport facilities of the new terminal are very new, and the prices of restaurants are not expensive. It's just that the transportation is not very convenient. There are only taxis and buses. The departure interval is very long, which basically means there is no taxi. In the Inner Mongolia Plateau, the scenery is particularly beautiful!"

825,1304,"Congratulations ! You, L - qqn - qqfirstname - i, arrived in HZ at 8:37 a.m. from SZ followed by 5 flights of people and 30,000 post boxes at the same time with you! Welcome to the HZ!"
826,1305,"HGH new treminal T4 is extremely like a future construction,but the most disadvantage is that I arrive at midnight and I would transfer another flight next morning ,but the only rest place is the hard seat beside the check-in place"
827,1306,"T3 is basically all Chinese food items if you are looking for food items there is a KFC and Starbucks, but lots of renovations in progress"
828,1308,"Hangzhou Xiaoshan seperates both dosmetic and international airpot.The immigration queues were short, which is different from what I expected as airports like Peking International take around an hour to clear Immigration. But Im nit sure if its because I arrived at midnight, as the area was very unaccessible( ""ulu"", in singapore slang) and dark. F&B outlets were also closed. Our baggage also arrived almost 1 hr After we cleared immigration, so that was not acceptable. Not only that, I saw the airport staff throwing our luggage down, so I was really afriad my things would be damaged."
829,1309,"A very. Ice and modern airport of a romantic city of Hangzhou. The downside to it is that you can get to the airport by coach or taxi only. No metro, no rail line. And it is quite far away from the city center."
830,1311,This should be Hangzhou Xiaoshan Airport
831,1319,"Even in 2021, as China's national-level gateway hub to South Asia and Southeast Asia, Kunming Airport still has the world's fifth largest single terminal building."
832,1320,Second time using Kunming Airport. I stayed up all night underground waiting for a transfer. There was no outlet so I had to sit on the ground and charge..ㅠㅠ
833,1333,"The airport is all in all very nice. The only problem is with the WiFi, the free WiFi network is supposed to be accessible after getting a message on your phone, but I was never able to get any message on the phone, despite trying with many options in the way of writing my French mobile number. On the day I had some waiting time before flying home, I finally found a network (VIP-NGK or something like that) which was accessible without any authentication. But it is a pity that the official network is not working correctly..."
834,1334,"It's very convenient to take metro, airport bus or taxi to Nanjing Airport from downtown. Here are some transportation tips. 1.If you decide to take metro, you need to get to Nanjing South Railway Station (Nanjingnanzhan南京南站) first,because the airport line(Line S1) starts from this huge station. It usually takes 40 mins from the station to airport. 2.How to ride the airport bus? There are 3 main lines. Line 1: Hexi Wanda Plaza(Near to Hilton)- Airport Optime(5:00-21:00) Freq.(30mins) Line 2: Nanjing Railway Station - Airport 5:00-21:00 Freq.(20mins) Line 3: Nanjing South Railway Station - Airport 5:40-21:00 Freq.(30mins) 3.Taxi. The Airport Highway is nice to drive. But if you are going to depart from downtown, traffic jam during rush hour should be considered. So it's more suggested to take metro in the rush hour. All taxis in Nanjing are by meter."
835,1335,"First time through new Nanjing airport, modern design. Immigration was fast, easy access to pick up by a car."
836,1336,"Brand new terminal with wide selection of food and beverages, subway connection to city center, coach service to nearby towns. Facilities are well allocated, big terminal but no need to walk exhausting distance."
837,1338,Will be 4 runways in 2014
838,1339,The newly-built terminal in 2019 still feels a little small. It is very convenient to connect with the subway. It is not far from the urban area. Check-in and security inspection are very smooth. The disadvantage is that the VIP lounge is too small
839,1340,The newly-built terminal in 2019 still feels a little small. It is very convenient to connect with the subway. It is not far from the urban area. Check-in and security inspection are very smooth. The disadvantage is that the lounge is too small.
840,1341,was great my first time in Nigbo International Airport. congratulations to the staff that were so good in attending passengers that were in numbers by the time I arrived at airport. keep up
841,1344,"I flew from Qingdao Jiaodong airport. Liuting is not operating anymore. Even if it’s a little bit further away from the city, it’s quite an improvement. Magnificent airport ????"
842,1345,"Goodbye, Qingdao Liuting International Airport. The purpose of this round-trip flight is to visit Liuting Airport, which is very close to the urban area, but the facilities are a little dilapidated."
843,1346,"WiFi was stupid - you needed to text a code to yourself for access. Of course with my phone being foreign, the reason I wanted wifi in the first place was to avoid roaming charges. But I would have had to incur those charges in order to get the password (which would have been sent by text). Poor system. Security was so slow that in spite of a short line, I almost missed my flight."
844,1347,"Airport about 40 minutes from city centre. Great selection of restaurants and shops in international section. The Capital Airlines flights to YVR and Melbourne are helpful, along with the China Eastern flight to SFO."
845,1348,"Best airport I found for entry / exit from China. Both Immigration, Luggage delivery and Customs are fast and efficient, much faster than Beijing or Shanghai. Not many international flights arriving here... but the new LH786/787 to Frankfurt is very convenient"
846,1349,"Average China airport, medium/small size. International check-in and boarding very easy, as there are very few international flights... ""inland"" more messy... usually lots of delays, and poor comunication for delay / gate change, ""airport system"" is quite poor, very few screens, not updated."
847,1350,"typical medium/small chinese airport... Information system on flights is poor even for China. Flight was delayed ""officially"" one hour (real one hour and half). Boarding gate after some time disappeared from screens, one had to ""guess"" that was unchanged..."
848,1351,Airport is O.K. - but you have to search quiet long time for help ..
849,1356,"First of all, does it make sense that there is no currency exchange office at the airport? And even though there is an ATM, it doesn't take out money hahaha. I'm really amazed."
850,1360,"Shanghai Hongqiao Airport is very convenient. After getting off the plane, you only walk a little distance to the baggage claim area. However, the luggage that you have been waiting for for for a long time is very convenient to connect with Hongqiao Railway Station. It only takes 10 minutes to walk. There are a lot of meals and the price is moderate."
851,1361,"Shanghai Hongqiao Airport is very convenient. After getting off the plane, you only walk a little distance to the baggage claim area.

853,1363,"Hongqiao Airport is very close to Hongqiao Railway Station. It's very convenient to get off the plane and take the train. The facilities in the airport are relatively new, the WiFi speed is very fast, many restaurants are not too expensive, and the security check is very fast,"
854,1364,"Hongqiao Airport is very close to Hongqiao Railway Station. It's very convenient to get off the plane and take the train. The facilities in the airport are relatively new, the WiFi speed is very fast, many restaurants are not too expensive, and the security check is very fast,"
855,1365,"Whenever I came to Shanghai I felt home thanks to the hospitality shown to me in the Hongqiao Airport. Thumbs up to all the staff personal of the airport for keeping the airport environment amicable, pleasant and clean. I felt well passing through the airport checking proceaidures because of the professionalism shown by the staff's 谢谢。"
856,1368,Very amazing airport was great architecture design like the curved roof. The airport also has a tiny chinese garden in the checkin area. The food and retail services are mostly closed (probably it was too late) and the wifi was decent. This airport is nearly perfect for plane-spotting during day-times also duting night-times (the glass is tilted so it have light reflections that might block the view at night)
857,1369,"Very modern airport and thoughtfully designed. The baggage claim system is fast and efficient. Its probably the most connected airport in the world: with taxi sections, maglev, metro line 2."
858,1370,Customs was quite a mess and took a while (I suppose this being China) ... Seems to be lacking decor and such too
859,1371,"Very modern terminal and lounge, walking in the terminal and boarding were very smooth, modern airport and good facilities."
860,1374,"Being the world gateway for Shanghai, PVG is a pretty decent airport. However, if you are comparing PVG to HKG, DOH or LHR, it’s a bit far behind. Nevertheless, it does the job ????"
861,1375,"There is almost no service provided due to the pandemic. While the facilities and hospitality are really poor during this time, the staffs are well trained and helpful."
862,1378,"Shenyang airport has a disadvantage that check-in only opens two hours before departure. It comes early and has no place to go. The security check-in line is very fast. There are few restaurants in the isolation area. The rest room is not perfect, but the overall airport is very clean and handsome"
863,1379,"Shenyang airport has a disadvantage that check-in only opens two hours before departure. It comes early and has no place to go. The security check-in line is very fast.

864,1380,"baggage claims were shared between multiple flights; ironically, 3 or 4 claims were completely empty and unused"
865,1381,New Terminal 3 a big improvement
866,1383,Airside not much in way of shops/cafes
867,1385,"The Shenzhen Airlines King Lounge made my stay very nice. I had been travelling for two full days before getting on my last leg of my trip and the shower and lounge facilities were a welcome solace. The water was warm and had nice pressure, the food was good and not too oily, and there was even a piano in the lounge (unfortunately you can't play it, even if you're a professional). The lounge bartender made one of the best espresso martinis I've ever had."
868,1386,"Transferring internationally or domestically at Shenzhen can be difficult, must take underground train from arrivals back to main terminal, then you exit the terminal before heading upstairs to the departure areas to go back through security and customs, was not the easiest to find."
869,1387,Why does this terminal become a parking lot at 6 a.m.!?? That doesn't give anyone any pleasure!
870,1388,"Getting to the airport: there's a bomb security check at EVERY SINGLE enterance and it takes ten minutes Check-in: you can check in online, and there are self check-in faciilties Security check: fairly fast Terminal facilities: good, but the walk to my gate was like a kilometer WiFi: it's censored Food and retail services: nice, but sometimes, the facilities are on the other side of the airport Lounge: not that rich"
871,1390,"the queuing for security check was terrible. A large crowd there, and everyone got a possibility for missing the flight. People just jump the queue. You have to walk a long way to the gate. Facilities were fine, same as any other international airports."
872,1391,"This is the most beautiful airport I have ever seen.The only thing that lacks, for becoming a top class airport, is a direct train connection to the city. Still, there are multiple lines to many places, I couldn't tell how fast they are, I just took one to Shenzhenwan, heading to HK. It's not a bad way for entering HK at all, if the prize difference worths it."
873,1392,"Super futuristic airport terminal! As with any new Chinese airport, you would expect to see similarities with Hong Kong's HKIA with its white on blue signages and high-ceiling airy open check-in hall concept. For Shenzhen, this extends to even the dining and shopping areas, where a second floor restaurant level overlooks the check-in hall. The huge ground transport complex adjacent to the airport terminal is a convenient one-stop place for your onward travel needs, though the lack of a direct metro station is a bummer; for now one needs to take the M416 bus to get to the nearest metro station."
874,1393,"The best airport ever in terms of architecture and design. Still transport facilities are not good enough: you've got to take a bus to the metro station and it takes about 15-20 minutes. The airport provides lots of restaurants, shops etc."
875,1397,"The design of Tianjin International Airport is very atmospheric. Although there are many people when they arrive, the terminal is still very cold. It is getting dark, but the lights are still not on, resulting in darkness in the terminal. Subway connection is very convenient."
876,1398,"There is a subway that can reach the airport, and the food at the airport is as expensive as ever. The security check was okay, but the check-in was a bit slow, maybe because I was flying with Tianjin Airlines, which is the main base company. There are many counters, but there are also many flights!"
877,1400,the lounge is not too big. there are not many restaurants or stores in the lounge but only fast food shop such as KFC
878,1401,"Pretty small airport. Though the airport has many choices of F&B there. The location is okay. There are many good hotels near there. Check in is quick and fast, just as for security. Wi-Fi was terrible though."
879,1402,"Used the new Terminal 2 which was only used by China Southern at the time. Many of the retails and restaurants were not open for business yet. The new T2 has a lot of airport operated First/Business Class lounge and has a Premium Service area set out for First and Business passenger. In general, the terminal is very similar to the PEK T3 as they both operated by the same management."
880,1403,"The security check is very strict, you have to take off your shoes, and you have to take off Xiamen Airlines when you come back. Urumqi Diwopu Airport is the main airport of China Southern Airlines, so Xiamen Airlines of the SkyTeam alliance uses the terminal of China Southern Airlines. The terminal is not small. I bought a map inside, which is very good!"
881,1404,"Too strict for the passengers from Europe. When we arrived there were many checks of our helth and wash of our schoes and many other things. It went pretty well thoe, but the airport had internet only for the chineese people and the facilities were in poor condition."
882,1405,"This airport is the biggest airport in Xinjiang Region and is the busies airport in Mid-Asia. It is very convenient and near to urban which is only 30 mins driving. Due to some reason, the security check is very strict.But for us passengers safe it is worthy. Low delay and cancel opportunity."
883,1409,Snacks are offered free of charge to connecting passengers. I still hope that a Chayan Yuese will open in it~qaq
884,1410,The international terminal is really large but has very little to do: one/two shops near the ANA gate.
885,1412,"Wuhan Tianhe has a new, integrated terminal T3 since Oct, 2017. T3 is much better than the previous international terminal T1, although the food/retail services and first/business class lounges there are still insufficient comparing to its capacity."
886,1415,"Seems to be a lof of construction work at this airport. This may explain that our plane had to travel a long distance after landing before finally unloading us to a bus... And the bus again travelled a long distance... Baggage claim was reasonably speedy but poorly marked, our flight number was posted on one belt but with a different city, then it disappeared completely, on another belt the city we came from was posted, finally our baggage was delivered on the belt where there non longer the flight number and not the right city, so somebody coming late to the belts would probably have to guess..."
887,1416,"Wuhan's domestic terminal is somewhat below the average in China. It was easy to get there by taxi, I haven't tried other transportation means. Checkin was quick and easy, ground staff understood English. Security check was simple and quick, a few passengers though. Very few restaurants inside, I counted two restaurants and two cafes, I have eaten at the California beef noodle restaurant, it was average, and relatively expensive. It was easy to get access to the free wifi (you need a Chinese mobile number for that), the speed was ok for browsing websites. Boarding was quick and easy. All in all a very average airport, but I liked it,"
888,1417,"My home airport...so I'm probably a bit biased in its favor. :) Overall, it's small enough to be easy to get around and find everything, but large enough to have all the amenities. However, if you don't speak Chinese and don't know what you're doing, not many of the staff, including those at the information desk, speak much English at all. Transport to and from the airport is rather expensive by taxi (it costs me 180 yuan/30 dollars to get home, although that's the upper limit as I do live on the opposite side of the city). There are well-organized buses that run to several points around the city as well. But it's taking forever to get the subway line out there working--that will change everything."
889,1425,Nice and clean new airport. Easy to find the way.
890,1428,"The air conditioning at this airport does not work so well in the summer. It was extremely hot inside, especially in the business/first class lounges."
891,1429,thumbs up to all the staff personal of the airport for keeping the airport environment pleasant and clean. I felt well passing through the airport checking proceaidures because of the professionalism shown by the staff's 谢谢。
892,1432,Going past immigration was a hassle because there were enough attendants for the number of travelers. Not many food options as well. Overall not a bad place for a small layover.
893,1434,"If you are going to travel with Xiamen Air using Xiamen Gaoqi International Airport as transfer airport, take into consideration that Xiamen Airport doesn’t have transit zone (!). You have to pass through Border Control, collect your luggage and check in again for your next final destination. In my case, on my way from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur (through Xiamen), my luggage was checked in to Xiamen and then I checked in again to Kuala Lumpur in Xiamen Airport (though whole route was issued in one ticket). It is really inconvenient."
894,1440,"a small airport, with good view on the tarmac. One runway which we tracked back to take off."
895,1453,"So, if you;re ever visiting, this airport is basically the same as pre remodelation, but, they gave it lovely atmosphere and also it is very cozy. But, while they were remodelling the airport, to chack in, you had to go to an igloo, literally."
896,1454,"A fairly comfortable airport, aesthetically not very nice but functional. The amount of services available is the worst detail of the airport, buying a soft drink became an impossible task."
897,1455,The best airport on the entire Atlantic coast. The smr and ctg aero looks like a bus terminal.
898,1458,Absolutely loved the El Dorado Lounge with the gold artifacts. The food served left a bit to be desired and the alcohol selction was severely lacking but overall a great lounge with a lot of quiet space
899,1459,"My favorite airport. Great organizational structure, customer service is 100 and the views are phenomenal"
900,1460,"Excellent flight without complications. I do not recommend middle seats, it is very uncomfortable for a long trip and at night"
901,1461,"I liked the airport, very pleasant, I ate Latin food, a soup that I had not eaten for a long time, rice and meat ???? All very well"
902,1462,"The gate for remote positions downstairs are extremely crowded and there is lack of food options down there. A LATAM flight was delayed on the gate close to ours and the passengers were furious, making the small space even smaller."
903,1463,"Good airport, especially for international connections, since it is not necessary to pass through immigration. Be ready to walk a lot, though."
904,1464,"BOG airport surprises me every time I go there. Its incredible El Dorado VIP room stands out as one of the most interesting rooms I've ever been to. If you take into account that it is a room in a South American airport and that it is also open to the public via partner programs (LK, PP and DP) it becomes even more incredible. Nothing negative to mention about BOG."
905,1465,"Immigration was quick for me, as I am Colombian. However, it is a lot slower for other immigrants. I did not use the toilets or anything, so I can't really say anything about that. The airport did not seem as clean as Pearson Airport, but it was not dirty either. Finding luggage was surprisingly easy (I’m mentioning luggage because it was hectic to find at Heathrow Airport, UK). The Wi-Fi was okay, not bad, just okay. El Dorado offers only 30 minutes of 10 MB/s before charging a ridiculous amount. Customs was not bad; they only asked three questions before letting me continue. This is not a problem, but I think that Customs can be more friendly when interacting with people. After that, I met my family and got in the car. One thing I do not like is the airport surroundings. They are very disorganized and filthy, especially when getting to Bogotá."
906,1466,Excellent Service at El Dorado Airport. We got tickets for the flight we wanted and the attention of the lady selling LATAM tickets. Excellent. Very good attention from the ground staff
907,1467,"Good airport, seats are also good check in with enough time sometimes migration takes longer than spected for foreigners."
908,1468,"GREAT! it is a small airport, everithign was clean and shiny security was perfect. It has a lounge but you need to pay a extra fee to a other company to get access"
909,1469,"Spacious building with restrooms and food, all the services you might need, windows all over the place to take great pictures of aircraft."
910,1471,I flew to this same airport back in 2012 and I was very pleasantly surprised at the upgrades it has undergone since I last visited! It has become a much more pleasant airport to fly into and out of and may have matched some (of the not so good) European airports in terms of convenience.
911,1474,"An airport with an average structure, but at least during the ""mid-season"" period, it didn't compromise anything. Extremely weak lounge, VERY crowded as it seems that Avianca (we accessed via LK) raffled off entry for everyone. Needs to improve urgently."
912,1475,You have to walk on the tarmac to get out of the plane although it’s not an issue. Just know that don’t bring long sleeve and bring a jacket instead since the heat is horrible in the right seasons. The immigration lines were short considering we were the only plane to be there.
913,1478,"Not a bad little airport, it could do with a bit more once you get past security. As usual in Colombia, can the staff please smile sometimes. Get a taxi to get there, the road entrance is hidden and it can be missed otherwise."
914,1479,"Tiny little airport, super cute and there's a lounge right next to the gate so you can wait until the last minute to board."
915,1486,"Love this airport, so much closer to the city, very green, easy to pass through. Just doesn't offer a ton of service so your options are limited."
916,1487,"my favorite airport in the whole world, I love its stained glass windows, its architecture, its wide spaces"
917,1488,Nice airport second busy airport by traffic not by passengers before 1985 it was the international airport of Medellin so even 747 landed and took off .small but nice never flew from her at flightradar24 says even Avianca is coming there but that was years ago so data incorrect on a nice site b.t.w.Satena is renewing there fleet after some dark financial years but now in the plus and getting more space by leaving LAN Colombia to MDE Rionegro JMC the international airport of Medellin.
918,1489,"Medellín Airport is extremely modern, well prepared as I've seen a few times in the world. Structure for cars and trucks to arrive is pretty good. Check-in made via totem, security pretty fast and WiFi that works really well on common areas. Lounge could be better, better-signed and with more food. Lounge WiFi did not work for me."
919,1490,"Medellín Airport is comfortable, well-signed and WiFi works well. You just must pay attention to taxi drivers that may charge you a lot more than expected and scammers that make you believe they are Uber. The only odd is the stop point to cars and trucks, that are on the opposite side of the road and may cause accidents."
920,1491,"As of April 28th, the airport is presenting a low volume of flights due to the suspension of Viva and Ultra's flights. Check in desks usually get crowded from travelers getting relocated into Latam and Avianca flights. If you're planning on checking baggage, arrive with enough time if flying Avianca. Latam has a decent amount of self check in desks, so they'll usually be less crowded."
921,1492,Tired of how Colombian police at airports target foreigners for questioning and treat you like a criminal unless proven otherwise.
922,1493,As the airport is expanding its route network (as Viva's hub) there are more flights per day than before and the current facilites for customs are very crowded at times. If you're local I would highly recommend to enroll in BioMig in order to help reduce queue times.
923,1495,"MDE put me into a 70's mood back again, but it was notable how very few of the airport was actually from the 70's other than the design. It's been very well maintained... every time I go it looks like the windows were new, walls freshly painted, and floors just installed ! It certainly is a very pleasant experience because customs, baggage clame, passport control, etc, are very fast. The airport has a good WiFi without timeouts, logins, or any of that annoying stuff. Lounge choices are good, you have Avianca, Copa (which both are Star Alliance), a Menzies Aviation lounge for Skyteam, Oneworld, Priority pass, etc. None of them are bad, however the best must be AV's brand new international lounge. With the new tunnel, the 1 hour of taxi ride into Medellin turned into 25 minutes, so very convenient from that point of view as well. Very recommended airport, which is not as big and crowded as others such as Panama City, which is crowded and dreadful at all times, or Bogotá, which in rush hours can get somewhat crowded an annoying."
924,1496,"Inmigration & baggage claim is one of the best of all latin america, too fast (no more of 5 minutes of holding) the terminal is too small and the wi-fi services doesn't have a big reception but out of all of this, it's a great airport."
925,1497,"Good Airport. Loved the architecture and easy to go through. Not many queues in security or customs despite the fact it was international departures rush hour. For my flight to New York, Avianca gave me access to the Copa lounge, which was nice. Overall satisfied with the airport"
926,1498,"This airport isn't near to the city, it's a 45 minutes (aprox) ride, but the view when you are close to Medellin it's amazing. It's an old airport with restructurations, nice architecture and easy conections."
927,1499,"Excellent airport, despite being a terminal with regional and domestic operations, it has excellent facilities and extremely pleasant service. It is currently being expanded to proceed with internationalization."
928,1500,"It is a great airport. The best in the region I would say. I can't wait for it to be international... Los Garzones is a regional airport that serves the fabulous pearl of Sinú, Monteria. sdfdkfdskfjpdsvpdsds fdsbgdgsdgdsgc xvcgdsgvxvxvx bxbxb"
929,1501,"It is a great airport. The best in the region I would say. I can't wait for it to be international... Los Garzones is a regional airport that serves the fabulous pearl of Sinú, Monteria. sdfdkfdskfjpdsvpdsds fdsbgdgsdgdsgc xvcgdsgvxvxvx bxbxb"
930,1504,"When I visited the airport was small and very old, but right now it's under construction the brand new airport."
931,1505,"PEI surely needs a facelift, which fortunately is coming. The only lounge is microscopic, however there isn't room for anything bigger as the airport is also very small. If you have a morning flight, you will very probably be delayed because of poor visibility regardless of the airline you're flying. Fortunately, this won't be a reality for much longer as the ILS approach (which will enable very low visibility approaches and even automatic landings) will be completely installed by December, and the brand new terminal will be here by June next year. You really see the building coming to life, and I think it'll be great and hope it gets here quickly!"
932,1511,"The highlight of this airport is certainly its brand new VIP lounge, which had recently opened. The room has a very beautiful decoration and good options for drinks and food, even in the form of quick foods such as snacks and the like. With a view of the runway and a good Wi-Fi connection, it provides a lot of comfort to passengers who hold their flight there."
933,1512,"Simple airport but provides the necessary means of arriving on the island. The best way to get to the center of everything is on foot, although it takes 20 minutes to walk, at least in our opinion. What surprises positively is the EXCELLENT lounge recently opened at the airport. Very beautiful and very tasty food options, it pleasantly surprised us."
934,1513,A Very Beautiful Airport. And Excellent Attention and advice from the Staff. Police service all the time. Very Nice.
935,1514,"On this day, the air conditioning in the waiting room was not working, the runway under construction did not allow the aircraft to land at the correct time, delaying the flight's departure by more than 6 hours."
936,1515,"San Andrés is the crown jewel of our country, is a paradise but the entrance door of the island, the airport its really bad, its old, small, some areas do not have air conditioning... Colombia needs build a completely new airport in San Andrés."
937,1517,Basic but functional.
938,1518,No wi-fi.
939,1519,Nice Airport...Friendly service!..plus you can smoke around :)..
940,1520,"It's pretty far away from the actual city and getting there would not be economic. The airport itself it's small, but nice, tidy, easy to go all over it and have nice facilities. The runaway it's to short for such an important airport."
941,1521,"Decent small airport, newly renovated, looks nice, location is even better. Just wish they'd turn up the AC a little bit."
942,1522,When I visited the airport was in construction the new terminal so I have to come back again to see the new airport.
943,1528,"No currency exchange at the airport. The Air NZ lounge was nice. Great view of the mountains from the airport. Plenty of space in the waiting area. The wifi sucks for uploading, and i had the stra alliance lounge wifi, not hospital wifi."
944,1529,"Steamy arrival, at 6.15am, deplaning onto the runway which is quite novel for the size of plane (777) but contributes to the island experience. Airport took a long time to process us through, but serenaded both incoming and outgoing by Jake Numanga on a Ukelele, he is still doing this (rated 4 stars because of Jake). Handed a bottle of water and a liana necklace. On the way back out, for 8.15am flight to Auckland, shuttle bus pick up time was 5.00am, arrived at 6.45, which for those of us used to strict '2 hour check in times' is pretty scary. They were really laid back about it and this is usual here."
945,1533,"Small, but expected"
946,1534,"LIR is an experience, I'll tell you that! The roads to the airport, depending on where in Costa Rica you're driving from, can be bumpy, unpaved roads, or perfectly smooth asphalt roads. The check in area is crowded, undersaffed, and hot, as the AC is not avalible until the post security area. Frontier check in was OK though, but American and Delta looked rough. Our first time flying through LIR, security took us upwards of 90 minutes, so be prepared! Lucky for us, we got through in about 30. The agents are nice though. The waiting area seating is hard plastic, so don't count on a relaxing chair after all that standing in line. There are some nice big windows with runway views. They do offer free WiFi, which is a nice touch. The food and retail is extremly overpriced, and meh at best. As far as I can tell there is no lounge here. This part of Costa Rica is beutiful though, so that helps!"
947,1535,"People are amazing, but the terminal is packed and not air conditioning. Also, food is very limited and extremely expensive."
948,1536,"This is a small, but well laid out airport. Almost the exact opposite of San Jose intnl. It took us only a few minutes from check-in to get through security and into the lounge. Lounge itself isn't bad. Some buffet food, a beer tap, etc. Best part is they have a side room by the bathrooms that is a perfect place for kids. No toys, but cartoons on the TV and out of the way so you don't bother other people."
949,1537,"Very Very efficent airport, some should take an example from them..."
950,1539,"Immigration was slow for the number of passengers and the queue was very disorganized. The airport is not easily accessible by public transport, so if you don't want to rent a car, the only option is taxi or Uber. For those who rent a vehicle, it is a little easier due to the transfers that rental companies offer."
951,1540,"Check-In and Duty Free was fast and efficient, the terminal is very clean and modern, there was no delays, also the Copa Club offers very good options"
952,1541,"It's been many years since I flight for the first time so this one was like starting over again and everything was fine, the lines weren't too long, and the migration process was pretty quick actually."
953,1542,"I am from Costa Rica but saddly the food in the airport is extremely expensive, more than that regular airport with all the basics available"
954,1543,"Immigration was doing its best to deal with at least three arriving flights at the same time, and polite when you reach the desk. Despite that time, bags were not at the carousel for another 30 minutes. Dingy meet and greet area outside."
955,1544,"Medium-sized airport, but with everything you need, clean and spacious waiting rooms, attentive staff. With all the accessibility for all types of people. All kinds of shops for travelers."
956,1545,"It's an easy-to-use airport because of its size. The check-in process is fluid and smooth, the gates are very well identified."
957,1546,Small. VERY EXPENSIVE FOOD AND DRINK. some views of the runway. Lots of seats although it gets busy around the departure of the few longhaul flights in the late afternoon.
958,1549,"Quite a large regional airport at the southern corner of croatia. It has everything you may possibly need, albeit the offerings may be a bit on the expensive side."
959,1552,"It was a very small but well organized airport with one exception, they mixed 3 flights at the same luggage claim and it was a bit messy"
960,1553,A small airport easy to navigate. Security was fast. Not much in the way of refreshments available and like all airports they are overpriced. Airport is a fair distance from Dubrovnik and taxies are expensive but an airport bus is available and relatively frequent. Arrivals might involve small queue at immigration
961,1555,Nice small airport although getting bigger but security check fast. Airport though is a long way from Dubrovnik and costs in the region of Euro35-40 in taxi to get there
962,1557,"The airport is about the same size as Doncaster Sheffield (Robin Hood) Airport, however due to the great amount of passengers the airport is very crowded, and not what one could call a relaxed atmosphere."
963,1558,"Check-in was super fast and stuff was so friendly. Security check was also fast even it was so detailed. Terminal facilities is so good for small airport like this one in Dubrovnik; good wifi, comfy chairs, food is also good,..."
964,1563,"For s very small airport I was surprised by how good Pula airport was, Upon arrival immigration was very smooth and bags arrived quickly. On the return trip, checkin was efficient as was security."
965,1565,"As other travellers have noted, Pula is a small airport. Access from the road is first class and everything inside the airport works smoothly. Plenty of seating. One of my favourite airports."
966,1566,"This is a very small airport, only 4 gates. It is well organized and the atmosphere is good. Old fashioned check-in with paper boarding passes, split and the larger part collected at the gate. Passport control when we arrives, Croatia not part of Schengen agreement. Effective and did not take too long time. Overall, a good experience for a vacation week in Croatia."
967,1567,"Nice little airport with very friendly ground staff. Everything is located closely together and it doesn't take one very long to check in, go through the security check, etc. Unfortunately, the WiFi was terribly slow."
968,1568,"Small, but cool airport with great people who works there. Airport have own exit from motorway and that is good. I said, airport is small, but is nice and functional. For me, its stupid that the gates are on the floor so older people have problem there. But, its ok, you need more flights and that aiport will be more better in future! :)"
969,1569,"Small but nice airport with own exit from motorway. Friendly stuff, easy to find everything what you need. The gates are on floor, so you must use ladder to go in plane. Like this airport, much better than airport in Rijeka."
970,1571,"Love the 70s style terminal, only arrived looked very basic and hasn't been updated from the feeling when walking through"
971,1572,It is a nice airport with nice and professional staff. Fast check in and securty. Everything was going smooth. I am always happy when i take off from Rijeka. Great car rental service at Last minute rent a car. Great vacation.I recommend to everyone.
972,1573,Great great airport with beautiful nature and very friendly people. The food is excellent. Outside is a very peaceful and hear only the sounds of birds. Most beautiful island. I recommend to everyone.
973,1576,"I love Split airport, as everything is always speedy, and everyone who works there is so nice towards everyone."
974,1577,"The split airport was good on arrival, however returning to departures. Security staff were very rude and departure lounge was very small."
975,1578,"The only thing I miss in this airport are boarding bridges, it would make more efficient, also they need to build a taxiway alongside the runway to improve safety and have more fast take-off and landing. Also more food kiosk needed on departing hall. No automatic check-in available"
976,1579,"The only thing I miss in this airport are boarding bridges, it would make more efficient, also they need to build a taxiway alongside the runway to improve safety and have more fast take-off and landing."
977,1580,"A very nice terminal; free WiFi available in 60 min chunks; however, only one fast-food like option to eat before security."
978,1581,Airport was soooo quiet. We were the only flight on the board! Felt like travelling on private jet. All good.
979,1582,I took a domestic flight so my experience was some what limited. Check in and security was easy but during COVID-19 pandemic it’s is everywhere currently. Departure lounge was fine with a good view of apron and incoming flights. Good options were limited at the single shop by the domestic departure gates.
980,1583,Easy access to the airport by line 37. Check-in as well as personal and border control quickly and without queues. Beautiful view from the terrace to the runway. Free and fast wi-fi.
981,1584,"Everything is newy short ways to walk, a viewing deck, lots of bathrooms. Also a good connection to Split with a shuttle service."
982,1585,"Self check-in was absuletely terrible, you can print your boarding passes, your baggage tag, but you cannot scan and send the baggage away yourself, you have to go to the normal chceck-in counter and have staff do it, obviously this means standing the queue, which renders the whole self chceck-in pointeless."
983,1587,Overall very nice airport with some AC and a lovely spotting terrace outside. Only 7 Gates but very modern and relatively clean.
984,1588,"Small but convenient airport, with everything you need and a outside terrace right next to the apron."
985,1589,"Very nice little airport. Great view of the apron from the outside terrace, always walks over the tarmac to the aircrafts, really nice for aviation lovers."
986,1591,"There are regular express buses from the main coach station to the airport taking about 30mins. There is a large concourse with a cafe bar outside departures which is a sun trap in the right weather and gives good views over part of the runway. The departures hall is spacious and, when I passed through, almost empty. I didn't spend too much time there as I had checked-in online. From boarding pass check to clearing security took 10mins. I felt that this was good since there was a large queue. All of the channels were open and there were several loading stations per belt, so the queue moved quickly. The queue for immigration was equally speedy. The immigration officer was friendly. Airside was quiet too. There is a small number of facilities airside, all of which had free space. I didn't notice anywhere serving proper meals. Nor did I notice any water bottle filling stations. My flight was departing from gate 17, reached by an escalator at the left hand end of the concourse. This is a small area with a simple facilities. There is probably sufficient seating for the number of passengers that a CRJ900 can carry."
987,1592,"There was no queue at the non-EU passport control desks and I was at the baggage reclaim very quickly. There was same delay before the baggage conveyor started. Apparently, 20 minutes according to the display. I was staying close to the airport, as my original flight was due to arrive at 10pm, while this one arrived at 8pm. I had arranged to be picked up at the airport by the accommodation that I had booked. I made contact after I’d cleared customs and was picked up about 10 mins later."
988,1593,Flight back was 2 hours late due to freezing fog in London. Once back at Heathrow it took 2.5 hours for the baggage to be delivered. Why it took so long to remove a couple cargo boxes from a plane and take them to baggage reclaim who knows?
989,1596,On line Check-in did not send boarding card forcing us to a queue even checked already. Police border unpolite. Low quality restaurants
990,1597,Very quiet and clean airport. The boutique area is a bit small. I regret that the tram or a commuter train does not stop at the airport.
991,1598,"A peaceful little airport, and a very modern terminal and easy navigation outside and inside of the building. Odlično!"
992,1599,"It is a great, modern small airport. Even very short transit times (30 min) are easily doable here. And for longer stays Wifi, several stores and food options are available."
993,1600,"Airport after small kid sicknesses on very beginning, now become modern and user friendly. No complaint at all."
994,1602,Poor or non-existent air conditioning in tropical climate. Slow passport control. No PA system or information displays at the gates.
995,1603,"This trip, the swab was done on arrival in the terminal,,,in November , the swab was done at the hotel"
996,1605,"A delightfully small airport,immigration and customs is easy and who can complain about 2 ice cold beers for $5.00 CAD."
997,1606,Cayo Coco airport was a very small airport with not very many facility's. The toilets where satisfactory and well maintained. There where some shops to buy things that you can not take through security like honey and Duty Free. Overall the airport was Ok.
998,1608,"Great little airport, very practical and close to all the resorts. Customs and Immigration was a breeze, but then again, we were the only flight into the airport that day."
999,1633,"Terrible rental car parking markings! Had to loop once after i took the mandatory left turn at the smaller roundabout, then got in the wrong parking. Put some signs, people!"
1000,1634,"It was alright, everything there, the private transfers, but I didn't really like the staff, but it was enjoyable"
1001,1635,"A little slow on the baggage coming out, also being a Business passenger with so called priority luggage waiting 20 minutes after the first bags appeared, isn't my idea of priority."
1002,1636,Hi! Larnaca airport was not so good. the check in took almost an hour and the food was really expensive
1003,1640,"Very poor service at check-in, almost appeared as though they weren't sure of what they were doing. No fast track for Business passengers and no priority boarding."
1004,1641,"Very poor service at check-in, spent 20 minutes talking to each other rather than starting the process. No fast track for Business class passengers."
1005,1642,"A small but very clean, nicely laid out and Hassle free airport. Check in efficient as was security. A larger than usual duty free area, plenty to relieve you of those surplus euros! The options for dining are quite limited but in keeping for an airport of this size i’d say. No long walk to the gates which all appeared to be serviced by air bridges, so any prevailing weather rendered irrelevant. My arrival here also went without incident so, taxis right outside, nice and handy. Overall a very satisfactory experience."
1006,1643,"Small airport but so quick and easy to get through, staff nice and not stressing like some countries. Smooth path through customs ????"
1007,1644,"Very good experience today, efficient and friendly service throughout. A quiet morning but all facilities were available"
1008,1645,Airport is VERY expensive as far as airports go. Expect to spend EURO15/20 per person for a very basic meal with a soft drink. The check in and security process is probably the most efficient I've ever but the rest of it lacks in staff proactivity.
1009,1646,"Basic airport with basic facilities. The food outlets airside we saw were rubbish and as usual, a rip-off. Taxis are also a rip off. Always refuse the first price as they negotiate. I actually walked away and the driver came after me to offer a lower price."
1010,1647,Baggage claim took really long and they didn't even bring the buss we were supposed to go on so we had to walk in the boiling hot weather the toilets were clean enough and staff were nice
1011,1648,"Departing Pafos is difficult due to Cypriot Covid restrictions. Check in and immigration are OK. What let's it down is the departure lounge. Every other seat not in use, so departing at weekends is hit or miss whether you get a seat or not. Announcements may as well be al in Greek (they are in English 50/50). Impossible to hear and actually a waste of effort."
1012,1649,Arriving in Pafos is OK now that Covid testing has stopped. Still needed my Cyprus travel pass and Vaccination certificate. Baggage claim is hit and miss.
1013,1651,I had no problems with this great airport It such a nice airport nothing bad i have to say about it!
1014,1652,Brilliant Service Quick through security. Great food. Can recommend central bar. Our flight was so well boarded.
1015,1654,"The airport is rather smaller. Only tourists fly in and out. Generally older facilities, queues at check-in, toilets average. Airport Lounge is quite small, but it doesn't offend or impress."
1016,1655,"Bus service links Brno train station and city center with the airport. Runs frequently. You only need an hour before the flight, as not many flights go out of Brno."
1017,1657,"At the time of this flight, the terminal was the older structure that has since been rebuilt and more state of the art. Entry was a breeze."
1018,1660,"A small provincial airports with its ups and downs. Getting there is an easy 28-minute bus ride from Brno central station, with convenient connections to Prague, Bratislava and Vienna. Only 6 gates and a single security checkpoint, two shops and a basic cafeteria. Were it not for the overzealous security staff, flying from BRQ is like taking a train."
1019,1661,Smoking AREA !!!!!!!
1020,1666,"Small regional airport with friendly staff. Immigration after arrival from non-schengen country was smooth. Public transportation to the airport is little user unfriendly, even though there is a train station at the airport, but you can always call a taxi to the city if needed."
1021,1667,"Trip OSR-PRG. Fast check-in (only me), super fast security (only me), but boarding was quite slow.. 4 persons at gate at the same time :/"
1022,1669,"Since the airport is small airport staffs have really a lot of time to check all passengers very carefully, I have never had such a detail security check like there, not even in USA... in 3 metres my ID was checked 2 times, even I flown to Italy, which is apart of schengen area and defacto no document check should not be needed... A miss at the gate was quite rude and was yelling to passengers in my oppinion for no reason (older people stood in a priority line...) otherwise all was quick."
1023,1670,"OSR is a small and sleepy provincial airport but it is also the only one in the country which has a direct rail link to and from the city it serves. I had to get a flight at 5.30 am, so I took the first train from the Central Station at 3.57 am and was at the airport exactly half an hour later. The check-in was quick while the security check was maybe a little too thorough but I guess they can afford to spend more time on each passenger when there aren't too many of them. The transit hall wasn't dead despite the early hours - there was a shop and a café open. The hall itself is rather spacious with plenty of seats. Furthermore, there is a business lounge in one end and a smoking cabin in the other (unlike PRG where the only chance to have a smoke is in a cafe provided that you invest in their expensive beverages). There is free wi-fi throughout the terminal (240 minutes per day). The connection was suffficiently fast both for my phone and laptop but if you need faster internet, you can also get it by paying a small sum to the provider. Boarding is quick and efficient with bus transportation to the plane. All in all, a very civilized experience without any hassle."
1024,1671,"Small local airport, nice hall, fast check-in and security. To get there is bit tough, but for airports like this it is I think normal. Overall rating is pretty good."
1025,1672,"Good accessibility, clean lobby, quick check-in. Slightly more expensive restaurants and stalls at the airport. The possibility of a good train connection to Ostrava and beyond, but it must connect to the plane. If it does not connect, there is no other option than individual transport by car, because buses do not go there very often. :) --- Good getting to the airport, clean and modern, fast check-in, friendly staff, but a little bit expensive restaurants and kiosks there. There is a chance to get to Ostrava by train, but the train must go, if not, only individual transport is possible, because the bus goes very rarely. :)"
1026,1673,"Ostrava airport is a straight-forward facility that serves its purpose well. Nothing less, nothing more."
1027,1674,"Free WI-FI is missing the most, the lobby is tidy and clean, check-in is fast, restaurants are expensive. There is a great lack of regular bus lines connected to flights from catchment cities. On the way from Příbor for the third time! year, the ongoing repair of one bridge and the closed road from the highway greatly complicate transportation to the airport."
1028,1679,"Overall very good airport with a cheap Lounge, different duty free, including non perfume ones. The airport is very good for plane spotters because from the gates tye runway is visible. There is also a spotting spot outside of the airport. On my last flight the airport has been evacuated because of a start of a fire. And everything went slightly everyone was outside in no time."
1029,1680,"First time departing from Praha airport terminal 2. Getting to the airport is easy but a bit far from the Praha center. You can take the metro or the tram till the Nádraží Veleslavín metro or tram station and you can find easy the 119 bus stop that is near the metro exit to go to the airport terminals 3, 1, 2, don’t forget that you have to take a luggage ticket that no one tells you to take it but better be safe than sorry if you have a ticket control. In case you missed the terminal 1 stop you can walk from inside the terminal 2 to terminal 1 from a connecting corridor (8 minutes) but you can’t go to terminal 3. The check-in desk at this airport are quit different from other airports because they’re in the middle of the terminal and not at the back wall like most of airports. You have to find the classic big airport screen that you will find your check-in desk number and not the modern screens with the departures. In overhaul my check-in desk was easy to find and my check-in was fast. The security check was fast and not under pressure. They was a lot of people at the normal waiting line and ones you arrive at the security check desk you can stop at the one that have less travelers waiting. At the check you can find bags for liquids to take as many you need, after that you find a staff member that explain to you what to take off from you to be X-ray and also if you need to take off your shoes or not, if yes you can’t find some plastic bags for your feet to not walk directly to the dirty floor. The terminal facilities are good at terminal 2 expect that you don’t have a lot of resting areas you have to go to a gate to see and rest their but you can find different things to see in the terminal waiting for your flight or that your gate appears to the information screen, you can find also a special waiting area with services for travelers with disabilities witch is easy to find. Food and retail services are good you can find a lot of duty free shops and also a good amount of choice for good food stores and bars with local beer. I didn’t had a lounge access so I can’t tell about it."
1030,1681,"Getting to the airport is easiest with metro and bus, but it would be good if the metro goes directly to the Airport. Passport check was fast, but getting through the narrow lines is not that easy with hand luggage. It's bright at the terminals and you could easy watch the planes landing and taking off. There are lots of shops and food options."
1031,1683,Clean airport. number of peoples is okay. Bus AE(Airport Express) is stopping litteraly few meters from the airport
1032,1684,Good and clean airport. Wifi is realitivly good for that it is n airport. But only issue is food price and security checks it is so slow
1033,1685,"Baguette for 160 KC - it's served on plates of gold or wtf ? Immigration were fine, quick, no problem, no weird questions, worked as expected."
1034,1686,All the luggage did not arrive at the baggage belt until the luggage from another flight started arriving. There were 30 people from our flight waiting for their luggage and no one knew if the luggage was lost or not.
1035,1687,"Really good airport. Lots of shops, good navigation and the airport is really cleany. I'd love to fly from this airport."
1036,1689,"The new facilities for immigration and luggage are impressive, and quiet for those who new the old ones - even if my luggage took 45' to appear today"
1037,1690,"The new airport facilities are great, as well on arrival as on departure. Although on departure there are still too many checkpoints. Also, once on the tarmac, under the burning sun, we all had to queue again for 3 other checks before boarding the plane. P.S. I don't see the need of checking the international vaccination card on exciting."
1038,1694,Very nice airport with free parking. Friendly and helpful staff. One of the best lounge I ever have been at
1039,1695,"Aalborg airport is a nice airport to fly from. free parking, easy to find your way around the airport, easy check in and happy and pleasant staff. following flight airlines fly from Aalborg Airport. KLM, Lufthansa, norwegian, SAS, Jettime, Thomas cook, Vueling plus many more. Good trip..."
1040,1696,"Definitely my favourite airport by a huge margin. Easy to locate, access and no queues at all. Staff is friendly and very helpful. Only one major ""tax-free"" shops as opposed to CPH or LGW with multiple shops."
1041,1697,"Relatively small, and not that busy, but a few flights now and then. Very clean and effective. My favourite airport by far! Very fast security and great selection of foods, drinks and goods from the couple of shops."
1042,1698,"Brilliant regional airport, free parking, easy to come to and from, close to the city. Refurbished resently. can only recommend. Nice duty free, friendly staff, easily accessible. Check-in is easy too as there are many machines for self check-in."
1043,1699,"Getting to the airport is easy. As the airport is only a small one, there are no expensive airport busses - all busses serving the airport are just regular busses. Check-in is easy too as there are many machines for self check-in. Please be aware of the fact that it can take some time checking in baggage. Security check are good with an average waiting time of 0 to 5 minutes depending on when you're travelling. Terminal facilities could be better, althrough they are really good as they are now. Food are just as expensive as in any other normal airport."
1044,1700,"Brilliant regional airport, all just refurbished. Nice duty free, friendly staff, easily accessible. Abundance of free parking just outside terminal. Growing in terms of number of destinations. Probably the best regional airport in all of Denmark."
1045,1701,"Newly renovated airport not far from home. It's not a big airport, which definantely is a plus."
1046,1702,"Nice, airy, good areas. Children's room and check in & security superb."
1047,1703,My second home. I fly from here every second week! :-)
1048,1704,Fantastic airport. Love that you can walk from your parking and under two minutes later you're on the other side of security.
1049,1705,"Aarhus Airport is a wonderful airport, it's always a pleasure to fly from there. There's two things I wish in the future; 1. Letbane (light rail) from Aarhus to the Airport. 2. Motorway all the way to Grenaa"
1050,1706,No doubt that the big renovation Aarhus Airport have made is a game changer. It's good to see more companies join the airport.
1051,1707,AAR has undergone a massive upgrade. Lovely airport to travel from now. The terminal is basically one big lounge.
1052,1708,"Brilliant airport where everyone can get a first class experience. Great lounge, great furnitures, great food and a lovely playroom for children."
1053,1709,"Aarhus Airport is the best airport I know, not because they have loads of shops that I like or anything like that. They only have two, one before security and one after. But I still yet love this regional airport, it's once again the best airport I've ever known. Customs were quick, mainly because there weren't any. The baggage arrived fast aswell."
1054,1710,"Aarhus Airport is the best airport I know, not because they have loads of shops that I like or anything like that. They only have two, one before security and one after. But I still yet love this regional airport, it's once again the best airport I've ever known. The baggage claim is always quick, same thing with customs (Mainly because the customs aren't really being used). Overall, 5/5 star airport."
1055,1712,"Well..... A small local airport, in the middle of nowhere. That's basically what this is. A single carrousel, a single mens room and a single womens room and a immigration officer. That's what you see when you enter the arrivals. Very Scandinavian 70's tiles on the floor - yes, the brown ones, and well just far from anything really. Not like Stansted or Aalborg at all!"
1056,1715,"Lovely, tiny airport which has everything you need. You can grab something to eat, shop for snacks and souvenirs, all without the crowd of a big airport. And there's a LEGO store!"
1057,1716,"Small, fast and good restaurants. You have everything needed. But very shitty location and public transport."
1058,1721,"This small airport is a short bus ride from town for a reasonable price. The airport was quiet for the first few flights of the year. Security only took 5 minutes, even through my backpack had to go through twice. My camera was the problem. I long for the day when security rules are the same at every airport. There are few facilities airside. There are very few toilets and only a bakery for food and drink. There wasn't much seating that I could see. I departed from the far right of the terminal and once through the barrier there was a small seating area with tables and chairs. Large enough for the small aircraft that I was departing on. However, the barrier is at the bottom of a stair and there is little space while we were held there for about 10 minutes."
1059,1722,"Small quiet airport but clean, modern and efficient. If you want to get a train to anywhere else in Denmark, you need the bus to Vejle as there is no train station in Billund ????"
1060,1724,"One of the smaller airports but very nice, clean and effective airport. Very fast security check and nice personal. Easy orientation through the whole airport. Easy access to the gates."
1061,1726,"Quite convenient except a bad choice of location for the charging port at the gate, as the brick for the charger wouldn't stay as it hit a slab under it."
1062,1727,180 DKK (around 25-30 USD) is a bit too expensive for a sandwitch. A hard pass for anyone wishing to have an airport meal.
1063,1728,"One of the worst airports in Europe by the facilities and security check. Public transport is good tho. Very slow security check, old machines, you have to take out everything from your bag, they frequently send your baggage through again. The food facility selection is the worst, and they close around 9-10 pm. There is nothing to do there. Very bad. All lounge close very early."
1064,1729,"I think that the only people in the immigration queue were from the same flight as me, and since I was near the front of the aircraft, I was through in a few minutes. My case was already on the carousel when I got there and after buying my ticket; had only a few minutes to wait for a train. Very speedy and hassle free."
1065,1730,Alot of ways to get to the airport via train. Chech-in line quite short and it went fast. Security quick and alot of stores and resturants. did*t try the WiFi
1066,1731,"The check-in process was slow and quite cramped--it seems the airport is running out of available space for check-in counters. Otherwise, emigration and security was very efficient and there were plenty of food options in the gate areas."
1067,1732,"The terminal seems to be showing its age, as the arrivals corridor was old and cramped, and the bathrooms were very small and quite dirty. Immigration and the baggage claim process was smooth, and finding the metro was very easy."
1068,1733,"Getting to the airport was nice as it was cold and a bit busy, not much services but there is a self-service starbucks machine which is quite cool. WiFi was actually quite good. No immigration as its a regional flight. Baggage claim was not so great as the room is small and busy. Overall great airport for a city like Copenhagen."
1069,1734,"Just fine. We stood at the check-in for two hours (BEFORE security) because our ticket wasn't available. Not going to be flying BA/AA Codeshare anymore. Absoulutely crazy. The check-in area was very dimly lit, making it hard for the seniors in our group over 85 years old, to see. Security was fine minus some jackass arguing over a 24 OUNCE bottle of moisturizer. Please learn and follow the rules, you will not win, especially against a danish security officer!! Very well handled. So much for zone boarding. Zone was called and they didn't enforce the boarding process at all. I was in business class to LHR and people just stuck their giant roller bags up front I before walking all the way back to row 328, so I had nowhere to store my bag. Oh well, not trying to whine or anything but it is annoying getting run over helping your grandmother who needs extra time and space by some impatient tit. Staff was friendly though. We were delayed seemingly endlessly because a tug from 3 gates down couldn't push an aircraft back? I am an aviation management and flight technology major and that made no sense. It is what it is."
1070,1735,I live near this airport really good! Alot of food places and toilets around the airport i give this a 4 star rating!
1071,1736,"Small Airport, fast and easy. Not a lot to do. No regular bus service, but you can call for one, thats much cheaper than the Taxi. Would i fly here again? Yes- but id arrive shortly before departure, because there is not a lot to do here while waiting."
1072,1738,Quick and simple passage through the modern airport. Simple check-in procedures and short way to the aircraft.
1073,1739,Modern smaller airport. Quick handling through the terminal. Both self service and counter check-in available.
1074,1746,"Airport is in a good location, lots of cabs , negotiate the price first. Keep in mind the main highway is closed due to a bridge being out and the detour around can be a nightmare, it's possible the bridge will be out for the year."
1075,1747,Gregorio Luperon Airport does an adequate job of being a decent arrival airport. We managed to get through the airport reasonably quickly. Be prepared to wait while you pay for your Visa. Baggage was fairly swift but it is a small airport. One thing to note was our bags were off the baggage collection carriage and put to the side - thankfully we noticed this early enough.
1076,1748,lost suitcase found the next day
1077,1749,"I can't complain too much, because Punta Cana is scorching hot as it is, but a little AC would've been nice."
1078,1752,"The airport terminal for arrival and going to exit is pretty good, but for the depatures the desing doesn't look pretty good. On some spots in Check-in is trash. But after that the airport is pretty good"
1079,1753,"Punta Cana Airport is a mess. Uber drivers are not allowed inside the airport area and leave passengers far away the terminals. There were also few signs to show which terminals are each airline at, those who exists showed only the IATA code of the airline, not usual for lay people. The Terminal 2 were on maintenance, which were open and A/C were not working, even with a 40°C heat."
1080,1755,"IT is Hot in there! If you wore a hoodie on the plane there you’re gonna want to take it off asap after you land.Besides the crazy amount of humidity in there it is a fun and easy to navigate mostly…I’ll talk about that in a second.It is nice that some walk ways are outside in the warm Punta Cana sun , that was a nice thing to experience. Something I disliked though was the customs and baggage claim process which was slow moving and it was a maze to get to baggage claim."
1081,1757,"Not a large airport, security check was pretty intuitive and fast with only a small selection of stores. Vegetarian food options were available at Dominos, haven‘t tested WiFi."
1082,1758,"This airport was nice too ... It was really hot in there, people could smoke in it and the roof was made of wood sticks."
1083,1764,"Check-in was very slow, though the agents were quite friendly. It seemed they worked for third-party company ServAir and were not super familiar with Insel Air's systems."
1084,1765,"A pretty small Airport with not too many gates . Its easy to find your gate, the airport has a few shops inside. If you want to eat, eat before passing the security checks, because there are not a lot of restaurants inside the security area."
1085,1766,The airport in Santo Domingo is very convenient. We had no problem with checking in and finding our way to the plane. It isn't an over the top fantastic airport but there is also nothing wrong with it so I wouldn't mind flying into/out of or transiting this airport.
1086,1767,The airport did not plan correctly the flight operations on May 23rd. My flight was delayed 5 hours.
1087,1768,Small regional airport with a very short runway which can make landing experience a bit scary. It has only flights to Quito and not many operations during the day
1088,1771,"Guayaquil’s airport is an overall good experience. It’s infrastructure is adequate for its traffic and well maintained. Departure area food services as well as business lounge are average, access from the city can be quite busy. Immigration officials are very kind."
1089,1772,"Small and clean airport, very easy to go trough, nice staff and not far from the city which is great."
1090,1773,Transfer
1091,1774,"A very modern airport, the migration process is very fast and efficient, very good products in the duty free and relatively good wifi :D, the only bad thing is that a queue costs 0.25 ctvs in the city and 4 at the airport dollars, I know it is an airport but the price seems a little high to me"
1092,1775,New airport with ONE restaurant. Getting from the city to the airport takes nothing less than 2 hours.
1093,1776,This airport is very new but very expensive and there are no lounges. I live in Quito and fly out of here. I could have more restaurants.
1094,1777,The cleaning level is lower than last year Passengers boarding bridges dirty with trash . It's avery bad picture of Quito and Ecuador .
1095,1778,I notice a big change in this airport : before it was a reference in term of cleaning inside outside windows and bathroom . Since August I noticed in my 4 last trips that bathroom are less clean and sometimes really dirty . I don't know why but for me Quito is loosing its leadership in term of excellence very sad impresion .
1096,1779,I am from Quito and this airport is the best but small. It only has one terminal. But it is spacious and has all the services.
1097,1780,"A great, modern and comfortable airport. Everything you need works like Wi-Fi, power supplies for PCs, cell phones, etc. It's easy to get to, although the traffic is a little intense during peak hours. For the rest, it's a very beautiful airport. modern congratulations Quito."
1098,1781,Many bars accepted credit card payments but in reality with 3 different cards all rejected.
1099,1788,"Lots of extra security if transiting to LHR - tiresome. Inefficient lay-out, nothing decent in Duty Free. Toilets not clean."
1100,1789,it's a good airport has Wi-Fi and charging stations. Though they have Egyptian charging ports so I can't charge my electronics but other than that airport is great.
1101,1790,Very good airport I recommend buying a sim card that will last. Until after you leave for 4g lacks good Wi-Fi but overall 5/5
1102,1795,"We were able to park right outside the terminal, which was a plus. However, inside, things were a little slow and disorganised. There were lots of queues and passport checkpoints and at one point we were sent back again because a staff member had forgotten to stamp our passports. However, the staff themselves were friendly enough and there were quite a few facilities inside (prayer rooms, toilets, a museum, cafes)."
1103,1796,"The airport was less organised than the London airport we had flown from, but this became more apparent when we flew back on the return journey. There were long and slow queues and lots of passport checkpoints. However, the place was fairly clean and airport staff were relatively friendly. We didn't need the baggage claim this time but I remember it being slow previously."
1104,1800,Always make sure you have 25 money because once you have filled your visa travel card out on the plane
1105,1801,Ordinary water intended for a 2-year-old child was confiscated by the TSA for the duration of the flight. Unnecessary fuss. The water was originally packaged
1106,1803,Very weird a lot of walking from terminal to the visa check. But it was good. The baggage took a lobg time to get to baggage claim area.
1107,1804,Landed for crew swap and passengers from Hurghada. Stayed in the airplane so didn’t see much of the airport.
1108,1810,"Arrived at the international terminal. Long but correct security, luggage arrived quickly and efficiently."
1109,1811,"Departure area for domestic flights correct. Long security, quick check-in and restaurants in the boarding area."
1110,1813,"Very small airport for the mass amount of tourists going through it. No seats left and no lines for the flights, just crowds. There are a few restaurants and TVs across the waiting hall with sport games. While going through security you have to manually put in your name on a piece of paper."
1111,1814,Taxi drivers demand what they want to be paid and they all band together. Better to pre arrange if you can
1112,1815,"Departure Lounge very good snacks, ie bagettes!"
1113,1816,very good
1114,1817,excellent
1115,1818,Very good airport
1116,1820,"The airport is rather smaller. Only tourists fly in and out. Generally older facilities, queues at check-in, toilets average. Airport Lounge is quite small, but it doesn't offend or impress."
1117,1822,"Watch out when buying a visa on arrival - you wont pay $2 ""fee"" when doing it through the bank."
1118,1823,"One of the best airports in Egypt to arrive to. Very serviceminded staff. Easy to get out off. When departing is RMF only slightly better than other Egyptian airports, with silly checkpoints and annoying controls."
1119,1824,Extremely good security check. Hence took some time to get through to gate area. But worth it. Pizza Hut and coffe shop and some tax free shopping. Only 10 minutes by buss from Coraya Bay. Perfect for spending a vacation!
1120,1828,"Too hot there, (yes Egypt) but.. so small place.. really.. small :)"
1121,1831,"Fast security controls and check-in, don't need to come too early. Couple hours before departure is fine, you cannot do controls too early. Well guarded airport, before security controls you can only stay seated on a chair and go to the toilets. WiFi is only 15 minutes. As soon as you arrive someone will offer to take your luggage for 5 Euros, just say no and get the cart on your own. Quite thorough and repeated controls, but chill officers. Restaurants and bazar only after the controls, check-in and handbag controls, but they are crazy expensive. Bring your own food at least. In the gate area the AC is at maximum, so you have to cover up in order not to freeze."
1122,1832,A little bit expensive to get a cab from the resort but the well designed architecture of the AirPort makes up for it in the sunrise.
1123,1833,This airport seems to be spared from chaotic Cairo Airport. Well designed and has a lot more capacity to handle more passengers.
1124,1834,Wifi not working (don't receive sms with code). All food services closed. No buses to the city center.
1125,1841,Queu arrived
1126,1844,"Ok so the airport it self is pretty nice but the and immigration and the first security are chill. But when you go to your for example early they will tell you to go outside,get in a line and you will checked for the second time!! AND ONE THAT MADE ME MAD WAS THEY THREW AWAY MY SUNSCREEN HUH!? It was pretty weird and dumb they threw it away."
1127,1845,What I liked about best was getting early out of the airport and security was very easy. My least was when your leaving from SAL u have to walk alot.
1128,1846,"A good airport for connecting flights. The only bad thing were the secutity filters. The airport doesn't have passenger segregation, so if you depart from El Salvador you must pass by two security filters: one after the inmigration counters and the other before you enter the last waiting room. Wi-fi is acceptable. There's no much variety of restaurants after you pass the first security filter."
1129,1847,"Transiting flight. The lounge was nice, lot of good hot food. I forgot the name of the lounge. Avianca lounge is bad, nothing to eat there."
1130,1848,security was a bitch. i mean there was no line and i had my liquids. they litterally spend 50 cents buy a plastic bag. i did not have any peso and the guy at the store felt bad for me and gave me a free bag.
1131,1849,"traveling in avianca? Make sure to get early at the airport because of the rush hours is very busy the check in, the airport needs a bit more of space due to increased passangers in transit or traveling from San Salvador, getting to the airport is easy"
1132,1850,"Wifi isn't free but there are some restaurants offering it complimentary when purchasing something. The Duty Free sales are quite neat when it comes to perfumes and cosmetics, but prices may differ between the various shops, some are cheaper than others. Also with a little negotiation you might score an extra discount on your purchase. Customs are quite tricky when it comes to leaving the airport while being in transit."
1133,1853,One of the smallest commercial airports I've ever been to. Buses on Saaremaa are free and are connected to arrivals/departures on the airport. Buses will take you to the city of Kuressaare in few minutes and are pretty convenient. When it comes to airport there is waiting room before security as well as after security. At security people go one by one. For some reason there is also facility for passport control which I found very funny. Kuressaare is a lovely airport.
1134,1854,"The airport is tiny but extremely efficient. It even has a bar for drinks and snacks and should even have a guesthouse. Just expect to encounter the lady serving at the bar also when buying tickets and operating the security control. :) And still, all operations are done properly and according to European rules. For such a small airport it's quite complete, comfortable and very clean. Only minus is that there's no public transport to the airport (only a bus waiting on arrival). Not a problem when the weather's good, because then the 2 kilometer from the city are easily done by foot."
1135,1856,Small & Beautiful
1136,1857,"Best airport in the world... Small on the outside but big on the inside, as some would say. Very cozy interior, feels like a true estonian home to be honest. The redesigned ecurity check is just perfect and very quick, and staff are amazingly easy. Good ammount of shops and bars, and my favorite part, a Subway! The lounge and the VIP service (private terminal) are amazing too as I've heard. And of course, clean bathrooms."
1137,1858,"Beautiful smaller airport with friendly airport staff. Bunch of inexpensive restaurtans, multiple rooms for smokers, clean restrooms, free wifi and free drinking water tap. Airport is easily reachable by public transport (trams, buses). Everything is alright and for the size of this airport - it definitely deserves 5 stars."
1138,1859,I'm not giving it 5 stars because before check-in there is a lack of a play area to keep the children occupied during the waiting hours...
1139,1860,"Tallinn airport is very beatiful airport, there is very kind personal and very cool desing gates. I did not use Wifi, I did not eat food and I did not use lounge."
1140,1861,Small and very efficient airport. Very close to the center of Tallinn. Small little and alternative shops. Not your ordinary airport. Loved it
1141,1862,"A ""small"" airport that serves the region well. We didn't look for ways to get out by public transport because we arrived late, we were tired and I got a discount on Uber. Unless I'm mistaken, public transport wasn't worth it."
1142,1863,Tallinn airport is my home airport and it is one of the baltic biggest airport. There is very good spotting locations
1143,1864,"Tallinn airport is very beaticul airport and this is my home airport, I like plane spot there are go trip there."
1144,1865,* Most Expensive tax-free shop in the world! Ridiculous! * Best location - close to town * Tram directly to airport * People at airport should take reading classes for announcements - they feel it's a competition who's the fastest at reading them * Nice fast baggage service
1145,1866,"The best airport I have ever followed from. Short distances, fast services, good prices, innovative ideas, nice details, quiet and relaxing. It could not be better."
1146,1867,Tartu is one off the small airport in Estonia but they dont have Tallinn-Tartu and Tartu-Tallinn fligth sense when Estonia air stop operaiting. But Tartu airport is small and lovley airport.
1147,1868,Tartu airport is small and it is locating in the city far away what is made getting to city very difficul.
1148,1870,Flights between Tartu (TAY) and Helsinki (HEL) since 30.10.2011 operated by FlyBe
1149,1871,Flights between Tartu (TAY) and Tallinn (TLL) since 27.02.2011 operated by Estonian Air
1150,1874,"Most power sockets in the lounge do not work. Be prepared to hunt for one. The ones on the workbenches were the only working ones I found. Bar isn't open, but other than that the lounge is ok."
1151,1877,"This time was ok, shops open. Not the most organized of airports but one of the busiest in Africa and with that comes the 'african' style. Have to go with the flow."
1152,1878,"Current situation is not very comfortable if you need to travel to a destination which requires rapid PCR at the departure airport. Registration is easy and giving sample too, but almost no facilities at the airport beside one little coffee shop in the check-in area. Get your refreshments yourself to be safe. PCR testing facility doesn't provide card payments - only cash, getting the results is very unorganised - that can be done better. Good thing - wifi works well, would suggest some sort of charging stations to be able to charge devices and more seating arrangements."
1153,1879,The new ADD terminal 2 is of course better than the older and previous one but Bole is far away from the international standard. Even Cairo or CPT is better Airport in Africa than ADD
1154,1881,"A long, long walk from plane to security check. Very cramped area, hard to get through, no queuing culture, first come, first through. Actual airport is in need of an upgrade, only a few coffee shops/cafeteria style places available, no real rest area. Duty free very good and cheap although also suffering from cramped space."
1155,1887,Very small airport with an amazing approach along the cliffs and near mountains. Efficient with the baggage but we were the only aircraft at this moment. But there is only one belt for baggage. The best comes after the baggage claim area. There is one officer with a cute young dog which has to sniff at each piece of luggage after another. Never seen this before!
1156,1888,"A nice little airport with only 2 gates. Nice Duty Free, just only a cafeteria, and fast baggage claim."
1157,1889,"Excellent airport, very small but containing a good tourist information office and a bar where you can eat decently. The checks are very quick, as soon as you pass you enter a well-stocked duty free area."
1158,1890,"Small airport, friendly staff. Buses from downtown Torshavn to the airport. There is free WIFI, not completely stable, however. Kiosk and souvenir shop. Since it only goes a few flights a day from the airport, the staff is well prepared and works effectively."
1159,1891,"small but under construction. friendly staff, well organised"
1160,1893,"We had a 3 hour layover. One hour of internet felt too little, a bandwidth restriction would have been better suited. The food was quite expensive, even the Burger King. There was a playground which was good for our 4 year-old son. However, it was next to the area where people try and sleep. Very limited viewing of outside from within the international departure area."
1161,1894,"The Fiji Airways Premium lounge is a fantastic way to relax while waiting for a connecting flight. The staff are super helpful and friendly. There was a wide verity of food and drinks offered and the best part was the soothing shower that is available. Even if flying economy, it is well worth it to pay extra to spend the 3/4 hours as there are limited option in the main waiting area."
1162,1895,"Getting to the airport was tiring, check-in was good friendly staff & helpful, security was quick due to moderate crowds. Food was like everything in Fiji EXPENSIVE, retail usual expensive duty free, lounge ok nothing outstanding. As with all airports its almost impossible to understand to announcements being made over the PA"
1163,1897,Nice small airport. Everyone is friendly and happy to help. Check-in and security was quick and easy to get through. A few food options. Overall a pretty modern and clean airport.
1164,1898,"Nadi Airport doesn't have a lot of food options. Burger King (where the smoothie maker and the ice cream maker were out of service, and a couple coffee shops which were over priced. The airport is quite small and doesn't have much facilities. They advertise their high speed Wi-Fi everywhere, but upon connecting it doesn't work and show you a ""fatal error""."
1165,1899,Seems like it has not been too long since this airport was renovated. Nadi airport was modern and clean. The Fijian Air lounge was beyond my expectation.
1166,1900,Great little airport. Easy in and out; customs also easy. They have a small singing group play us some songs while we arrive and go through customs - nice touch!
1167,1901,"Not the biggest, not the smallest international airport. All essential facilities are present (food, duty-free, souvenir shopping, toilets of course), didn't have time to check internet avbility. Stay in Bamboo hostel nearby, great atmosphere!"
1168,1904,Arrival service (Airpro) was unmanned for unacceptable long time after my flight had arrived and needed some assistance. Could not reach by phone either.
1169,1905,"Great airport, very clean and comfortable. Baggage claim area is relatively basic compared to the rest of the airport, but it gets the job done."
1170,1906,"Terrible queue. 45 minutes to get to security when only one line of 17 was in use for economy, one for priority passengers. Poor customer service, don't recommend this airport anymore."
1171,1910,Helsinki vantaa airport is my most visited airport and it is very good and nice. There is train that can pick up you from airport and food is pretty nice and security is very safe. this is all i have to say
1172,1911,"Wonderful airport, some shops were closed but many more have opened gradually since covid and I imagine continue too. Glided smoothly through and have nice decorations."
1173,1912,"Goddamn amazing airport, beautiful interior design, a lot of amenities, lots and lots of shops, clean bathrooms, nice staff and much more... Finnair lounge could have a larger food choice though."
1174,1913,Automatic security with no need to put all the things out of your carry-on is really cool and saves time drastically.
1175,1915,"Small airport. No public transport (except taxis) available. Security check was quick, however staff was rather stressed and rude (compared to other Finnish airports)."
1176,1916,Friendly service. Getting to the flight is very fast. Free wifi. However not properly staffed when arriving late in the night. Should book a taxi in advance when arriving. Taxi ride to the city centre is fast though.
1177,1918,Pretty good
1178,1920,"Everything is fast, convenient, reasonable, great internet, but like everywhere else in Finland Duty Free is expensive."
1179,1921,"This is a small regional airport in the Arctic Circle, don't expect anything large. Saying this its well run with all of the services you need. You will walk to the aircraft so wrap up warm if travelling in the winter. Will use this airport again. Cleanest toilets ever !!"
1180,1922,A fantastic little airport!
1181,1924,Very tiny and quick to get on the plane. best airport..
1182,1925,"Cozy regional airport with it's own fast business flight terminal. Easiest and quickest way to visit Ostrobothnia, Central Ostrobothnia and the southern part of Northern Ostrobothnia region."
1183,1926,"Kokkola-Pietarsaari or Kruunupy is a lovely small airport. The airport only operates a few flights a day. As earlier the airport is very small. It only has 2 gates. The airport has a cafe. There is also a Wi-Fi connection, but it is only turned on ~1 hour before departure. On overall the airport is one of the best regional / small airports in the world."
1184,1927,"Took us just five minutes to drive to the airport. And it´s a small and nice terminal with not to many confusing signs. Parking it´s also great at summer. It takes about 15-20 minutes to drive from Kokkola to the airport, and 30 minutes from Pietarsaari."
1185,1930,"It is very small, but very cozy. It makes me happy when people come to work for our flight - it’s somehow human."
1186,1931,It's such a small airport so it has only the basic things. Well maintained. Friendly service. Getting to the flight is very fast. Free wifi. Should book a taxi in advance when arriving. Taxi ride to the city centre is fast though.
1187,1932,"Its a nice small airport. I was flying often to Dusseldorf and never had problems. Nice service and fast controls! Very central, fast by car. The cafe was friendly and their had good food."
1188,1933,"Pretty cozy small clean airport specially for lowcost airlines. Didn't notice any particular disadvantages, so it was pretty good!"
1189,1937,"Very boring treatment at the security check, claimed that I had a tube/bottle of some kind in the bag (which I did NOT have) so it was screened 3 times and the contents out, nothing was found (which I knew) but not a hint of an apology!! Very unprofessional"
1190,1938,"Very little airport. Quick to get through, but no with Wi-Fi. There are also no scheduled buses to city centre. You have to take a Taxi or walk 3 km. Walking is a little bit dangerous, because there are no sidewalks on the road to the airport."
1191,1939,Nice little airport.
1192,1940,"Oulu airport was not strange. The toilets were clean, and there wasn't much congestion. The employees were very serious and did not bother to smile at all."
1193,1941,"Easy transfer to the Airport with the Bus number 8. Oulu is a very nice small airport with beautiful waiting area. Little stores for the necessary things are available, as well as a little coffee bar. Check in staff for business class priority was unfriendly and didn’t even attach the priority sign to my bag."
1194,1942,very nice and spacious for a small airport. Nice view to the runaway and free WiFi plus playground for kids :)
1195,1943,"Nice airport and my home airport. Always good service and mostly flights are always on schedule. No delay because security checks or not too big distances to walk to gate. Quickly growing airport with good connections to Helsinki and from there quickly to Asia, Europe and North America."
1196,1944,small but having all facilities you need when going for short flight. also the kids corner is efficient for kids. food cort is not large but going to only domestic flight you don't really need more than the offered services.
1197,1945,Overall a nice airport. Usually pretty quiet but there might be some rush during mornings and holiday seasons. There is a shop and two cafes in the terminal. Security check is usually fast and smooth but sometimes time consuming. Access to aircraft from jetways is nice. There is no lounge in the airport. The airport has wifi but it doesn't seem to work with my phone.
1198,1946,"Good for a regional airport. Not a very large airport but has café/restaurant and shopping possibilities. Access to planes via jet bridges. Not so many passengers so the security check is fast. An airport bus between the airport and the city centre every twenty minutes, unfortunately doesn't go the straightest route."
1199,1947,5/5 (Y)
1200,1948,Love the new terminal!!!
1201,1949,The field has been renewed a lot.
1202,1952,"The airport is pleasantly small and close to the city, but ridiculously ill-connected outside of the tourist season. There's no bus service and taxis are naturally rather overpriced. Aside from that, the departure experience was quite seamless."
1203,1953,"I traveled alone. The escort from the plane was very nice. The flight crew performed excellently. There were a lot of them, but a few of them stayed for the duration of the flight. There was perhaps 1 flight attendant too many."
1204,1954,"It is a very small airport, just only one retail shop to buy something at restrict area. Short distance to go Santa Claus Village."
1205,1956,"The airport is very small, so when a plane arrives, it gets very crowded. I've waited pretty long to receive my baggage. It might've been caused by the amount of passengers. Besides that, the airport is really nice, everywhere you can see some Santa Claus related things. There are minivans going between the airport and Rovaniemi, if you pay a little more, they will take you exactly to your hotel or the place you stay in."
1206,1957,Small but very well organized airport. You can easily reach city centre with shared taxi that costs 7 euros and that can drop you anywhere you want. You can also walk or bike to the airport using bike paths. Airport has a good free Wi-Fi connection. Although it is small it has gates so you don't have to walk in freezing winter on the apron.
1207,1959,Had a long wait just for a puschair. Only a day trip so had no luggage.
1208,1961,Very small but comfortable and cosy terminal with lots of seating options. There is one small snack corner and a vending machine. Overall a nice airport near Tampere.
1209,1962,Great airport to travel within close to home. Fast Security Check and friendly staff. Recommend to fly supporting local airport. Not much retail services in terminal.
1210,1966,"Small regional airport, poor services but efficient. Finavia's WiFi is always reliable and security is a breeze. Getting to the airport can get expensive by cab, try to catch the local 61 bus (soon changing to #1) or Ryanair's bus to get to the centre."
1211,1968,A hot day and no air condotion in the terminal.
1212,1969,small terminal with a cafe/bar.
1213,1971,"Small airport, easy to access. One shop/cafeteria after the security check. Plenty of seats, hardly any lines."
1214,1972,"The airport, very small and intimate, no shops, only a cafe. Access to the airport by bus number 1, goes every 10 minutes. Free wi-fi in the airport. Queues for check-in are quite long."
1215,1975,"Quiet, calm airport. Convenient to get to. There are no queues, you can arrive 30-40 minutes before departure."
1216,1977,"Small but cozy airport. No rush and everything goes fast.Small but convenient cafe just like at airports its size. Good communication facilities with WiFi. To get the airport very easy, and guided properly. Very near the city of Turku. The security check fast. Atmosphere very silent outside rush hours, which are very few."
1217,1978,"Turku airport is very small and everything runs smoothly. There is never a line to security. However, don't expect any services. There is a small café serving cooffee and snacks but it only opens when the flight is scheduled to leave. If there is a delay, the café closes anyway. Turku airport has free WiFi."
1218,1984,"Don't be afraid of the ratings, afterall, it's a regional airport more than a national one because Corsica is a French department."
1219,1986,"Only one small coffee stand selling coffee, juices, sandwiches inside the secure area. There is a duty free inside the secure area. Free wifi was easy to connect."
1220,1992,"EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg is quite convenient small airport, not far away from the city center of Basel and well accessible by bus or car at least from the Swiss side. Check-in and security although are not really modern, I never had to stand in a queue be it Low-Cost or regular airline, utility facilities are quite sufficient Duty free is not well accessible for every passenger, those departing with many KLM an Air France flights have to walk in the direction of the other gates, then their departure to walk back again or many simply miss shops and cafes. Cafes are extremely overpriced in comparison to other airports, even more luxurious like ZRH and the choice of food is quite limited. There are often crowds in cafes. Terminals lack seating spaces and power outlets, that’s why it might be a challenge to charge your device and I suggest bringing a power bank. The biggest highlight of the airport is business lounge. One of the best lounges in European airports I’ve been to, very spacious for such a small size with wide selection of drinks and good food options and for a very reasonable price of 30CHF, which is about 1,5 full course meals in cafes. Observation desk there is great and gives very good view of the entire airport. Lounge is quite and never crowded."
1221,1993,"Very friendly staff. Customers are served everywhere in three languages, depending on their needs. German, French or English. Hon. Crossairlounge (now Skywiev Lounge) is simply great. Very nicely decorated, not overcrowded, friendly staff, small but good food selection. Absolutely recommended."
1222,1994,"The departure exit on the Swiss side is small, and there is no place to exchange money or buy a SIM card. However, other than that, there were no particular problems. Wi-Fi can also be used without any problems."
1223,1996,"Baording procedere was very long, annoying and inconsistend to Covid 19. Otherwise Basel is a nice airport, small, easy to reach and fast."
1224,1997,"Generally calm airport, nice though modest food offering executive lounge. Good Bus 50 into Basel but trams and more seating would be good."
1225,1998,"Getting to airport was easy, dropped off by family and straight into the terminal. Check in was straight forward as was the security. The facilities were good in the airport though it is a smaller airport. The lounge was empty, I was the only one in there. It was well decorated and looked good. I did like the water feature."
1226,1999,"Arrival at Basel was problem free, short wait for the baggage to come off. Security and customs took no time at all as we just walked straight through."
1227,2000,"The airport was a bit busy, with a lot of passengers for the Easyjet flights of the afternoon. The que for check-in was long. The line for the security check was also very long. It was very strait forward after the security check but only one shop. I came through the security only 2 minutes before boarding started."
1228,2001,Check-in wasn't too fast but also not very slow. security was a little bit crowded but still fast. I couldn't find any shops behind the security which was an disappointment for me.
1229,2002,Very quick deplaning and bagage claim. Also fast customs check for the COVID-19 before we could get to the bagage claim area which also was fast.
1230,2003,Very quick process. The luggage belt began putting out luggage only 5 minutes after we came in to the terminal. Very small terminal but not very crowded.
1231,2006,"I love Bastia Poretta Airport. it's a little cute airport next to Bastia. with old mixed with new architecture. it has one cafe / restaurant and some sitting corners. While sitting in the restaurant you see all the people walking to there plane, employees putting the luggage in the planes, and planes taking off. i dont know why but it seems like an cute family business. all the employees knowing each other. And everybody seems happy. it's simple and cheap to rent a car, and there are taxis, and busses to get to the airport. there are not much shops or things like that but you dont suspect that on a small airport like this. this is definitely the cutest / coziest airport i've ever b"
1232,2007,Magnificent sunrise
1233,2008,"The problem with arrivals is that there are only 2 customs officers checking arriving passengers' passports, and as a result, the queue to get out of the airport can be 45 minutes, especially if two planes arrive in quick sucession."
1234,2010,"This is my local airport, and it needs lots of money spent on its facilities. Getting to and from the airport, if like me you don't drive, you need to use a taxi which is expensive and takes ages to arrive (there is only one taxi cab firm in Bergerac) Local buses would be a good idea, but the taxi firms have put a veto on that - so no buses at all. The arrival 'shed' is exactly that, with no facilities to handle checked luggage not even a turntable or conveyor belt. The last time I met family at the airport, they were on the last flight of the day, and whilst waiting for a taxi to arrive, the Restaurant/Bar had already closed - so not a great welcome to the area for my family."
1235,2027,Amazing airport to arrive and depart. Everything you need can you find there. Clean toilets and waiting areas. Friendly stuff.
1236,2028,Small airport. A nice little store with truly local products for a change. Not much choice for having/lunch dinner and a non-functioning WiFi though.
1237,2029,"Small, pretty new and easy-to-navigate airport. Check-in and security control are rapid. There are not many possibilities for shopping and to eat but it is not the reason we visit to airports, is it? The only drawback is the transport. There is a shuttle bus to the nearest tramway station. Unfortunately, it does not operate often. It can happen, especially in the night, that you need to wait an hour for the next bus! Taxis are available for 25-45 Euros a ride depending on time and destination in Brest."
1238,2031,I have to complain about the public transportation to the airport. There are flights early in the morning but no way to reach the airport in such hours. The same for the flights landing during the night.
1239,2032,"The building is lovely and new, but the facilities are very limited. There is no lounge for Business Class or SkyTeam Elite Plus members, and once through security there is only 1 small bar/cafe with light snacks and refreshments. I couldn't get the WiFi to work at all. The login site was only in French, and I just couldn't connect past the login screen."
1240,2034,"Better go to the airport via taxi/bus. the car park is small and rapidly full before morning flights. It's a small airport, there is one (sometimes two) check-in desks and the security check is passed around 5-10 mins. The only bar as closed as the airport is in renovation. There is some automatic distributors around. No Wifi and no lounge."
1241,2035,"Great airport, the companies are there and its activity is proportional to the size of the airport and the vfr is super active, the runway remains very long over 1900 meters and the airport offers 3 runways and an active terminal"
1242,2036,"A great little airport. Not much in the way of services there, but the parking is pretty cheap - and the first hour is free. The free WiFi works - which is unusual in my experience. There is a good small cafe, but other than that nothing else other than a machine for chocolate etc. The Air France desk acts as a general information point - they can help with parking problems etc"
1243,2038,A rather small developing airport adequate but my wife and I did laugh and think perhaps we were in the Australian outback
1244,2041,very small airport !
1245,2042,Effective bus service to SNCF station. This city is a must see.
1246,2043,"Excellent airport, with a few PAX planes, otherwise painting training... @ Alexandre Leconte if you inquired a little you would know why AF does not offer a line on CHR before criticizing ;) ..."
1247,2044,"Good airport with a nice, large runway for all types of aircraft! Small terminal with friendly staff although this is not their main activity, but with good future prospects with new lines to come! Airport mainly dedicated to freight activities, training, maintenance, storage, painting and dismantling of end-of-life aircraft."
1248,2046,"Good airport. Easily accessible, modern and clean, with very good Wi-Fi connection. The airport has a fast food place and also a Business terminal for private flights. This airport is very pleasant."
1249,2047,CFE used to be a hub for Air Inter. Now there are few flights so the airport seems over-dimensioned (qomehow strange feeling). But the facilities are OK for a medium-size French city
1250,2048,"Apart from a deplorable offer of routes and mediocre service to the city of Clermont, monopolized by AirFrance due to poor management by the region; the airport itself has nothing to complain about with suitable services for a regional airport. I do not agree at all with the last completely stupid comment (To Leconte): the catchment area of ​​the airport is more than 500,000 people in a region with significant industrial dynamics. Furthermore, I don't see how a 3km track is a fault. : it is indeed an asset improving flight safety."
1251,2050,"Hi Im working at this airport CFE Its small but smooth airport ! WC clean, and free wifi since last summer 2014 ! Food and drink its okay but a little expensive ( 6 euros /8 dollars USD for a sample sandwich) The waiting zone for flights is okay but take your phone or book because no duty free ! The parking for car its 2€ / 1 hour There are a lot of rental car agency (hertz, avis, europcar,...) Its good airport for a short transit or to visit Clermont Fernand, careful, we get bored quickly ! You have taxi or bus for the center or hotel around Clermont ferrand."
1252,2051,"Nice and small regional airport, no freewifi but security and checkin are very fast. It is very clean erverywhere. The airport was refurbished in 2013. A lot of infrastructures for a very quiet traffic !"
1253,2052,My favorite airport ! Small but very good organised !
1254,2053,"Hard to access. If you're not taking the taxi and you're taking the bus to Pleurtuit, you need to walk 45 min on a frequent route with no pavement. Very calm airport with no big service."
1255,2054,"Dinard Airport is very small, with just a restaurant before security. There is not one single shop after security so I was here 2 and a half hours before my flight, so i had to just get a coffee from the machine and just wait."
1256,2062,"to be honest it is a domestic aiport, but they need the extra money to run the airport so they cram loads of international flights for the winter season at a little domestic airport. even though it is small and the security line is long, it is the nearest airport to the mountains."
1257,2065,Not major airport but it is close to Alps so getting there asap is a plus! There is Wi-Fi but don't want register an account and then never use it again! All flights that arrive at Grenoble come from London and only one flight come from Manchester!
1258,2067,good uyvuvuyvubilijnljlnjnjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjnjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj
1259,2069,Work currently in progress at the airport that's why the immigration was so long (and you have to wait outside ... freezing under the rain). The terminal building is beeing enlarged. Anyway for such a small airport the servicing to the city centre is efficient and i'm raring to see the new building!
1260,2070,"Very pleasant small airport on the edge of the Atlantic facing the Ile de Ré!!!! Well served overall with interesting destinations as well as good companies! Small, friendly terminal with a bar-restaurant and a small shop. La Rochelle is a very pleasant city both for holidays and for its quality of life!"
1261,2073,It wasn't very big. Quite small and there wasn't enough seats to accommodate everyone. The lounges were bad and the WiFi only lasted 15 minutes (hey Lille! it's not the 2000's anymore)! It really needs an expansion.
1262,2076,"Lille 2nd best airport in Europe after Rennes, the Lille terminal is just magnificent, the companies varied despite the Lille Nantes line, In conclusion, the Lille airport is great, thank you for this great airport"
1263,2077,"A small regional airport wedged between BRU, CRL, BVA and CDG which competes with the train. Lesquin airport develops better and better year after year. The ground staff are competent. It never takes too long to get through security. The downside in my opinion: we need to improve the spaces near the boarding gates and have a real café once you have passed security."
1264,2078,"Duty Free is located before Customs. Once crossed, it is no longer possible to make purchases"
1265,2079,Disorganization with change of boarding gate and problem in leading passengers (on foot) to the plane
1266,2080,"Tiny but efficient airport, with only drinks machines available beyond security. Airport works fine as long as the airlines serving it do!"
1267,2081,"Limoges airport is Nickel!! Clean and functional terminal and impeccable quality of service for me! (cafeteria/bar, wifi, shop). In addition, traffic is very varied (passenger charter, business aviation, flying clubs)."
1268,2082,Small but has a cafe/restaurant and free wifi. Gates get very busy with Ryanair flights
1269,2086,"3rd time landing to Lyon LYS airports. Getting to the airport is easy with the Rhônexpress tram that brings you to Lyon Part-Dieu that you have plenty and different Hotels, the Lyon Part-Dieu SNCF central train station and also tram and metro lines and also a big commercial center (mal) that you can find anything to shop or to eat. The terminal facilities was quite good for the arrival terminal with an easy way to get your connection flight, services for travelers with disabilities. You can have also a good amount of food stores from a Paul bakery to fast foods. The immigration customs was fast because I was traveling for an European country to an other European country so no passport check with an EU passport or ID. The baggage claim was not so fast I had to wait 5 to 10 minutes to start the distribution of your baggages because the plane parked to a terminal that is not so close but my luggage arrived fast when the distribution started."
1270,2087,"3rd time flying from LYS airport and I show some impoundments. Getting to the airport by public transports is easy with the Rhônexpress tram line from Lyon Part-Dieu which you have the central SNCF train station and tram and metro lines, the tickets are less expensive if you book them one or tow months in advance. Also you can find some bus lines that connect the airport to Lyon. The check in was fast and don from the airline staff that I was flying. The security check was faster than ever because all security desks was on duty that day and it was also one staff member before the check that give you useful instructions for the tech and also bags for liquids. The terminal facilities was good with free Wi-Fi, resting areas with plugs to charge anything and areas for travelers with disabilities. You gave also a good amount of food stores from a Paul bakery to fast foods, also you can find different duty free stores. I didn’t have access to the lounge so I can’t tell about it."
1271,2088,Great airport with easy access and plenty of parking. Lots of people even out of season so expect a lot of waiting.
1272,2089,"To get to the airport is very easy with the public transportations, you can go by bus or with a special tram called Rhonexpress at the train station in the airport area witch the tickets are not so cheap but it’s fast and convenient. The terminal facilities are good and you can find pretty much what’s you want. About the food and the retail services, to eat there is not a lot of choices but you can find something good to eat before your flight. The immigration/customs are not very close to the gate that your flight will arrive but they are fast and efficient, at my arrival flight we had tow passport check one while getting out of the air bridge and after going down to the grind flor to take a bus to bring us to an other terminal to pass an second passport check we walk a while to arrive to the baggage claim. So baggage claim is also not so close at the gate that you will arrive but you will not have to wait a lot to get your baggage and is also next to the check in area and near the public transportations and parkings."
1273,2090,"First time flying from LYS, to get to the airport is very easy with the public transportations, you can go by bus or with a special tram called Rhonexpress from the Lyon Part-Dieu to the train station in the airport area witch the tickets are not so cheap but it’s fast and convenient (every 15minutes witch takes 20 minutes to arrive to the airport p). The terminal facilities are good and you can find pretty much what you want. The check in was very slow and the check-in was don by airport staff and not (Aegean airlines staff). The security check was also very slow because they havent a lot of security check desks open. There was also an alarm at the X-ray scanner so they transfer all you star to an other security check desk which I struggle find my bag after that cause some one forme the staff take it and put it on a table after it was ok because they didn’t had much space but nothing stolen. About the food and the retail services, to eat there is not a lot of choices but you can find something good to eat before your flight. The terminal facilities was ok and you could find what you want easy and fast. I have to tell that the airport staff was in strike and may be that was the reason of the very slow check-in but I finally get my flight witch was delayed cause the strike (they had tow refueling trucks for whole airport). Overall I’m sure that the airport in normal conditions is a very good airport with faster check-in and security check."
1274,2091,"To get to the airport is very easy with the public transportations, you can go by bus or with a special tram called Rhonexpress at the train station in the airport area witch the tickets are not so cheap but it’s fast and convenient.

1275,2092,"Second Time flying from this airport, getting to the airport is very easy with the public transportations, you can go by bus or with a special tram called Rhonexpress witch the tickets are not so cheap but it’s fast and convenient. The check-in this time was fast because it was don by the airline staff which was quick and efficient. The security check is always very crowded and you lose a lot of time because they have few security check desks, if you are on a hurry better take the fast track pass. The terminal facilities are good and you can find pretty much what’s you want. About the food and the retail services, to eat there is not a lot of choices but you can find something good to eat before your flight."
1276,2093,-Check in was quick an the staff was nice and friendly - Security was fast but stuff just wanted to finish theire jobs so the mood wasnt that great - Terminal was clean - Ther wehre just a few Food stores opend which led to long quees
1277,2094,-Baggage claim was difficult because there wehre multipli flights at one belt -Terminal was okay and had a good structure
1278,2095,"The new terminal's construction has began 2 years ago, and now all the Terminal 1B is almost blocked. And the building has delay again !"
1279,2096,I arrived late and made my way straight for the bus to the city. These are very regular and the journey doesn't take to long. The main concourse has many food options and information desks and the bus station is a short walk from the terminal exit.
1280,2097,"MRS is an easy airport to get to. I was staying near to the train station and from there there is and express bus for 10 euros to the airport. In early morning traffic, the journey took 40 minutes. I was departing from T1 Hall B. There was a lot of construction work going on and the route there was convoluted and not well signposted. Security took about 5 minutes. Once through there are few facilities. I couldn't see a hydration station. That was a pity, as I'd emptied my water bottle in the main terminal before I realised that I had a long walk to Hall B. I was not in the departure lounge for long, so the lack of facilities was not a problem."
1281,2098,Very good airport but the check in of Ryanair it’s a little bit complicated and he not work all the time.
1282,2099,Only bad part about exiting is these doors that control the flow of people i think and they don’t shut smoothly they slam on you very hard but managed to get through without being hit just some people got stuck
1283,2102,"Airport under construction, decent traffic, the future is promising and the work being done there will only be beneficial"
1284,2109,"Perfect small airport. The 5 stars are relative to the size. As a small airport, it is easily accessible but only by car/taxi. Check-in (not used this time) is easy and friendly. Security is friendly and there are hardly ever long waiting lines. Facilities are ok (bar, sandwiches, tax-free shop with quite a bit of choice) but not comparable to large airports. The lounge is nice, but also not comparable to large airports, both in comfort and in choice of food and beverages."
1285,2110,Really nice and modern airport. There is a shuttle bus (every 30 minutes) to the airport. There aren't many flights so it's not a busy airport. You'll get really quickly through security.
1286,2112,"the playground is a great idea but the security check which turns into a complete search of the whole family including the 3 year old kid because their explosive alarm detects laundry... yes I wash my bags sometimes , apparently it's a crime"
1287,2113,"Really nice airport: free WiFi, fast check-in. The air terminal is large and bright, just like the departure lounge. All the airport is very clean, silent and well organied. There are many duty free shops. The access to the airport is really easy. Parkings are not very expensive."
1288,2114,"Good airport. But the public Wi-Fi is free for only 10 mins... It's easy to get to airport, the shuttle can be take at ""Place de l'Europe"" in Montpellier wich is fine and accessible in tramway. The check-in is fast and easy, same for security check."
1289,2117,"I loved the airport shuttle which takes you directly from the city center to the airport. Even though the airport is small, the services offered are enough for everyone"
1290,2126,The automatic check in is really convinient and there was no line at security control. I arrived 40min prior to my boarding(one hour before flight) and i had time to eat and do shopping.
1291,2128,Passport control was fast. The airport terminal was clean and modern. Baggage claim did take a little bit of time though.
1292,2129,"The passport control process was smooth and fast. Small terminal, but clean and modern. Baggage claim did take a bit of time."
1293,2131,"Great airport and awesome possibilities to enjoy Nice by tram and bus! Tickets are cheap and tram and bus bring you all along the coast to see as much as you want! Many restaurants directly at the beach, little bit expensive but that's luxurious Nice!"
1294,2132,"Super quick from the plane to the hotel, about 15 minutes after landing at the hotel (Ibis style) easy to walk"
1295,2133,"Security moaned that I hadn't removed my camera from my bag, at busy times not much rom to sit. Lounge is reasonable but no good views across the airport."
1296,2134,"Very quick processing... little queues. With your boarding pass ready, from the airport entrance to your flight's gate at Terminal 1 just takes you about 10 min!"
1297,2135,"First time to the NCE airport, my experience was very good to this airport. Getting to the airport is very easy by public transportations with the city line tram L2 witch you can take it from the terminal 1 or 2, there is also buses which you can use the same ticket for both and it’s cheap. I didn’t had a check in baggage but the check in area was quiet and there was a lot of check-in desks for each airline which is easy to find your check in desk. The security check was fast with a lot of security check desks and also the staff was fast and efficient. The terminal facilities for a small airport like this one are great, you have a specialized area for food services, there is also a lot of retail stores after passing through the security check and you can find what you need easy and fast."
1298,2136,"First time to the NCE airport, my experience was very good to this airport. Getting to the airport is very easy by public transportations with the city line tram L2 witch you can take it from the terminal 1 or 2, there is also buses which you can use the same ticket for both and it’s cheap. The terminal facilities for a small airport like this one are great, you have a specialized area for food services, there is also a lot of retail stores after passing through the security check. The emigration/customs are fast and efficient. Also if you have a connection flight you can accès very fast to the boarding area. About the bagage claim you can arrive there fast and easy and you can receive your baggage quite fast."
1299,2142,"It's a very consing airport. At 6 a.m., there flights Schengen (Treviso) and non-Schengen (Ouija) side-to-side."
1300,2148,Terminal 3 good for charter flights. Quick and efficient check in and security. A sufficient number of shops and very good WIFI.
1301,2149,"Only for terminal 3. Terminal easily accessible, immigration time is good and rather quick. Baggage recovered quickly and in good condition. And presence of certain services. And WIFI very good. Good for a charter-only terminal."
1302,2150,"Stop over in CDG after a flight from MRS before. Too bad we can't go from a terminal to another, I had to stay in the T 2F for 4 hours"
1303,2151,I personnaly think CDG is a good airport but there is so many people waiting its hard to know where is your gate because there are so many.
1304,2152,"Nice airport, unfortunately underrated by most bur better than most. Specially other ones like Frankfurt or Arlanda."
1305,2154,So big. You can walk for hours. Luxury. Everything is so expensive. I got lost many times. Anticipate by arriving early. Far from Paris and expensive trip. Hotels are expensive and far. Expensive also to reach hotels and shuttles don't work all the day! You will maybe have to take a taxi.
1306,2155,"Following extensive renovations the airport is modern and easy to navigate, there are large touch screen navigation passenger portals where you can enter your flight details and you will be shown the route to your gate or anything else you may want to find"
1307,2156,"The airport seems to have a poor layout. We landed in fog, so I couldn't see anything, but we landed on one of the far runways and our taxy required us to hold to cross another active runway. There are regular trains from the airport to Gard du Nord."
1308,2157,"Busy and crowded. Security, despite sky priority, was chaotic and busy. Took about an hour to transfer from Schengen to non Schengen"
1309,2159,"The shuttle between the hotels and the airport was full, it could not take all the passengers from the following hotels. Far too many people at the same time in front of the check-in terminals. The control areas were also overloaded. The airport is easy to navigate. Wifi worked well. The snacks are good"
1310,2160,"The airport is a fair journey from Gare du Nord and on the day that I travelled, there was a rail replacement service covering the section from Antony to ORY. This made the journey longer than I was expecting and gave a little concern. However, The crew managed to cram all (I think) of the waiting passengers on. I was leaving from gates C where there are limited options for food and drink. There are a number of seats with charging points, but these seem not to be connected to a power supply. There are some nice loungers. The WiFi was poor. The signal strength was low and it kept on flicking in and out."
1311,2161,Arriving at ORY on a domestic flight is simple. I exited from the rear door and had a short walk in the cold. There is an exit which leads straight the main concourse bypassing the baggage reclaim hall. I took that and made my way to the shuttle train. The shuttle links the two terminals to the nearby train station with regular trains to Gare du Nord and onward to CDG.
1312,2162,"Getting to the airport,terminal facilities,WiFi ,immigration/custioms and baggage claim were all good but the food is to average and the lounge was not the best"
1313,2163,"The arrivals area in Orly is old and quite cramped--one has to do a lot of walking from the arrival gate to the baggage claim. There are also very few restrooms available in the terminal. Otherwise, the baggage arrived quickly and the walk to the metro was not too far."
1314,2164,"I did not use wifi, but i guess it not that bad. Its a super clean and modern airport. No delay everything was perfect. Really spaceful place where you can enjoy your time."
1315,2165,"Thanks very much to the staff at the check-in desk of iberia. I arrived in ORY and sadly lost my passport on plane, staff of iberia helped me get the passport in just 10 mins, even I was not fly iberia to ORY. It's amazing."
1316,2166,Very crowded airport that need a better AC because it can get extremely hot! An amazing selection of brands and retail shops for all the types os pockets! Boarding areas need more seating options and it’s extremely needed a new boarding method. Overall a very good airport!
1317,2167,"Great airport, 2nd of Paris for all domestic flights and to go to the french antilles (Martinique, Guadeloupe, Guyane), great airport !"
1318,2168,"Check in with Transavia was rather slow, although the airport being a hub for Transavia alleviated this. Security took around 15 minutes, with the queue moving consistently. Orly Terminal 3 is modern and has plenty of seating available in both the lounge and the gates. I did not avail of the food court, instead buying and microwaving a ready meal that was rather tasty. Passport control on departure was decently fast, with most passengers using electronic gates. Boarding was rather inefficient, although whether this was the airline or the airport's fault is not clear."
1319,2173,"Bare bones Airport! Well maintained though :) Not many facilities in the terminal, just a bunch of vending machines! The airport staff is helpful."
1320,2174,"Typical provincial airport; not a lot happening. No onward transport: no taxis, no buses. However the lady at the information desk was very helpful getting cabs booked. Departing, there is a drink/snack machine and nothing else."
1321,2175,"This is a nice airport with unlimited WiFi. It's a simple airport. There has never been too many people so it's simple to travel to London-Stansted, Lyon and La Rochelle."
1322,2177,Positive: -Small airport without a lot of people but with good infrastructure -Car retail services Negative: -Boarding and Deboarding organization
1323,2178,"The restaurant is still closed, visited twice at this airport (June and Dec 2021). No checkout at the single buffet (outside boarding area)"
1324,2180,"Rennes Airport now has a street view system (Google map) which allows you to visit the entire airport, including on the tarmac! It is the only airport in France which has this revolutionary system."
1325,2181,"Rennes airport is a very active airport despite its size, the VFR and IFR are very active and there is fast and regular boarding and the companies are diverse and varied. The planes can be quite large, the airport can accommodate md 11"
1326,2182,"boarding is very fast and quality. In addition, the airport has 1 bar, a store, 1 restaurant upstairs with a view of the entire tarmac, unlimited wi-fi, clean toilets, bus line 50m from the airport (all approximately 25 minutes)."
1327,2183,"Nice small airport, with a new terminal. Friendly infrastructures for a very low traffic ! The road to go to the airport is excellent, and there are taxis & bus after each arrival and before each departure."
1328,2187,"Mixed, between the usefulness of this airport which is equal to 0, where no one takes it and between the desert atmosphere, this airport risks being abandoned"
1329,2188,"Good airport, accessible (departure from Strasbourg central station every 15 minutes and arrival in 8 minutes)."
1330,2191,Going through security is a bit old-fashioned... It's not worthy of an airport in a European capital!
1331,2194,"A beautiful airport! Tarbes-Lourdes-Pyrénées is a planespotters dream with many decommissioned planes sat at the airport. These are easily visible when taxiing out to runway 02, or when landing. The terminal is small but is sufficient for the pax level."
1332,2195,"Small airport, well maintained, the problem is that there are never taxis available, and the only available shuttle is under attack, because it only does one round, and does not return to pick up the remaining people, unpleasant and grumpy security staff However, the police at document control (immigration) were very quick and friendly."
1333,2196,Good view of take off and landing and ramp activities
1334,2197,Long waiting and soe staff were rude
1335,2198,An nice Airport.
1336,2199,Nice!!!
1337,2202,"Independently very good services, but quite far from each other. The security is at the end of the hall D, check-in was in the hall B like 200m away, and the gate (n°9 for my flight) at the level of hall A et the other end of the terminal"
1338,2203,A huge airport yet so quiet and relaxed. I have been a few times to hear and it doesn't seem to have the volume of passengers as you see at the UK Airports.
1339,2205,"Pretty neat Airport, easily reachable by public transport. Just; 1. Coming from a Schengen area we were forced to go through the border control (odd) 2. Lounge is closed on Sundays before 14h"
1340,2207,Amazing organisation to this calming and down to earth airport all staff are kind and thoughtful this airport is a jewel
1341,2208,Extremely poor special assistance and coordination from ground systems. Ended up causing a 45min delay to flight
1342,2209,"Toulouse airport is a very good airport with many shops and a very good wi-fi connection. The check-in is fast, as are security checks. It is unfortunate that access to the airport is not more simplified."
1343,2210,"Nice airport with good facilities and good staff. One of the best things is being able to just walk out of the airport using no transport. This is surprisingly rare, but there is a tram stop right outside that takes to to the city center. Airport itself is clean and modern with nice architecture."
1344,2211,"Getting in / out: very easy and fast public transport to the city - I would go for bus rather than tram (more expensive but much more faster) Unfortunately, there are construction works Security - lack of proper Priority line."
1345,2213,Transfert from Vaitepe pier to Airport motu by Air Tahiti boat is a great experience and view on the lagoon is marvelous The most beautiful airport ever seen. Free seating on aircraft so choose right side for view at take off
1346,2214,BEAUTIFUL PLACE IN CENTER OF PACIFIC OCEAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1347,2215,"Wow, Bora Bora is a beautiful island !!!"
1348,2220,"Not rating the WiFi since I didn't use it. Return trip home, sad to leave. Had a blast. Definitely returning some time in the near future (next year?)"
1349,2221,"When getting off the plane, if you're an aviation enthusiast, this would be a great time to video the plane, they have an open tarmac staircase; I didn't realize this till we were getting off and you could practically touch the engine..you are THAT close. Processing took some time, be patient. Other than that, once you get through, it's pretty quick."
1350,2231,"modern and beautiful, but little messed with plan (check-in and security check enters from one lobby)"
1351,2232,"All in all a clean, new and good looking airport, but it’s not relatable for me why the boarding does not work with the QR code from the online pdf or wizzair application.. You have to go to the check in show your passport and PDF and get yourself your boarding cards."
1352,2233,"I got to the airport by Georgian Bus from Batumi and it was very good, the bus stopped just next to the terminal entrance. The check-in was ok, but you have to wait there so they print you a boarding pass. The security went pretty fast. There are some power sockets inside the departures zone (after the security check). Wi-Fi was good but not so fast at the beginning, but later it became faster. We bought a pear FuzeTea and it cost 6 GEL."
1353,2234,"The new airport, placed in the old environment, looks like a stranded spaceship. Everything is new and shiny, and there are some original USSR Volga's parked outside, at least 50 years old. The airport's biggest drawback: The air conditioning doesn't seem to be able to cope with the ambient temperatures. I can't explain otherwise why it should be switched to recirculation. In any case, with the temperature inside bearable, it was stuffy to the point of tipping over. Lack of oxygen. It is not a connecting airport. Immigration cannot be avoided. Anyone who wants to eat big when changing trains will be disappointed. There are exactly 2 cafes from the same operator, landside. Coffee, chips and alcohol are OK, there is very little choice of fast food (at least warmed up). Overall level of a (good) train station kiosk between the tracks. At least the coffee was pretty good :-)"
1354,2235,"Nice little airport, beautiful observation deck, free wi-fi. There are shops, clean toilets. everything perfect. The only downside is that you have to queue to check-in with your boarding pass."
1355,2236,For some reason they ask for printed boarding pass for which you have to wait in a 45min line to get. Everything else is good and the building is really modern!
1356,2237,"A compact airport. Check-in, security, and immigration check was quick and painless. Food stalls are okay and flights are spaced out nicely so there's not much of a crowd inside. There are stray dogs outside the airport but they're not aggressive."
1357,2238,"Nice small airport, modern clean building, getting to the airport by Georgian Bus from Batumi works well, good wifi... But the guys at security control are idiots - they required to put my glasses into rentgen, in opposite the liquids could stay inside the hand luggage."
1358,2239,"Small airport, clean and tidy but not busy. Disabled facilities good and working well and on time. Pleasing first visit."
1359,2240,"It's easy to find where to eat, there are a lot of signs, you won't get lost"
1360,2241,"A cool path for suitcases under the casino, but very crazy taxi drivers who jack up prices. Wifi drops out periodically"
1361,2243,"Overall, decent airport. The business lounge can be super crowded when multiple flights are scheduled back to back. This airport is not designed for high traffic"
1362,2244,"Very nice airport, easy to get around, kinda small duty free but it has some necessities. Also has fast food shops like wendy's and a dunkin donuts. Overall very nice but could use a renovation"
1363,2246,"Very nice airport, however had some issues while checking in at the counters, the check in manager couldn't find my name on their list, had to wait 45 minutes and finally was able to go. Security was fast and efficient, no other issue other than that."
1364,2247,"After arrival, I was the only one asked to check my backpack, apparently because of my nationality. Further, in the departure terminal there are no places where you can charge your phone. Tea coffee is one point and everything is expensive. The exchange offices in the arrivals hall offer very favorable rates. You won't find these in the city itself. The seats are metal, hard and uncomfortable. The amenities need work."
1365,2248,"Great airport and very convenient, it is relatively close to the city and you can go there by bus, the terminal is spacious and clean, the wifi works perfectly, the only problem is that there are not many options of food and shops."
1366,2249,This is the only airport where you can still smoke after going through security and the border inside the airport.
1367,2250,"Checking in and passing security was easy and fast, but the terminal services were lacking, there was not much to do there. Additionally, the free WiFi did not work for me"
1368,2251,"Traveling at BER is uncomplicated, and there are plenty of restaurants in the food court. Wi-FI is also available and entry and exit for EU citizens is uncomplicated thanks to automated passport/border controls."
1369,2253,"Not too bad at all.. well connected and clean and cozy airport. Got all you need, except awful slow baggage claim service - always at least 30min to wait after immigration is done, not good. As usual understaffed."
1370,2257,"The BER ist an big Airport, but the staff ist friendly and the Terminals and Gates are Well signposted."
1371,2258,Overall great airport. It was easy to get to/from although a little confusing what platform you needed to be on when leaving. The buldings were spotless and very modern. Everything was great
1372,2259,"Worst security check in the world, absolutely ridiculous. Staff is incompetent and machinery is old."
1373,2262,Check-in only opens relatively shortly before boarding. This is a problem for Lufthansa and was the same in Warsaw.
1374,2263,"The fastest baggage claim ever! Got off the plane, walked to baggage claim and the baggage came out without waiting time. Plane landed 21:02, we where out on the street in 21:14 :-D"
1375,2265,"Very Good Airport. Good restaurant. But you need to wait long at the security line, cause I waited 1 hour ????. I thing there was no lounge"
1376,2266,"Bremen was a wonderful airport as long as Ryanair had 3 airplanes stationed there and a second terminal, but local politicians destroyed that plan. Alternatives for all that cancelled routes are Hamburg, Hanover and Amsterdam. Tram line 6 from Central Station to BRE."
1377,2267,Basically no waiting time for the security check. The terminal has been reconstructed so that you can go to the Lounge even if you are flying with Ryanair.
1378,2268,"The Airport of Bremen is very small, clean and beautiful. The staff is very polite and it’s a perfect airport for holiday as a family. A very beautiful airport!"
1379,2269,"Although Bremen Airport is small, it also has very good service. The security check goes very fast (depending on the time from 7:00 a.m. - 9:00 a.m. the security check goes fast. As it is in the evening I do not know unfortunately). The staff is always friendly and helpful. You also have plenty of food options there. There is also a playground for children. You have to say that you can only eat before the security check After that you can also buy something, but the possibility is not as extensive as before the security check."
1380,2270,From deplaning the aircraft to the tram station you only need 5 minutes which is very convenient. Unfortunately on a Sunday the tram only departs every 20 minutes which is not very nice in cold and rainy weather. Apart from that it is always a pleasure to travel through Bremen airport.
1381,2276,Short way from the aircraft to the bus. Discovered some hidden ways to get outside the terminal quicker
1382,2277,Gate changed several times and the correct gate was not always specified in the app. Security check with approx. 25 minute waiting time okay.
1383,2282,"Probably the smallest airport I've been to so far. The arrival was good as well as the transfer to the city. For my departure flight everything was ok, there is a very small food area but enugh for me, found everything I needed and for it's size it was ok. Would like to see some cozy resting area also in the future. The area for the non EU flights where all the gates were wasn't very pleasing. Cramped and crowded ground level floor with not much character. Would like to see improvements here also. The stuff was very friendly, security was a breeze."
1384,2286,"Great little airport. Not many thrills, however it gets things done with the wonderful German efficiency."
1385,2287,"Nice little airport. Modern. Unfortunately, getting from the train station into the city is a bit expensive at €8.5. Still good and nice staff. Nice view of the apron"
1386,2289,"Small and easy! This airport makes flying budget airlines the easiest thing in the world. Almost like a bus stop, with security. Super efficient."
1387,2290,"Average small airport. People are being queued outside the terminal for immigration, which I found just awful, since it was cold, windy, and drizzling. No WiFi, no shopping, no food in arrivals, which makes is dull and boring."
1388,2291,"super good! getting to the airport very easy by bus or train from all cities around 100km. it is near the highway too. smal airport, so not busy. only a few people. i fly per year 4 to 7 times from and to this airport because of visiting family and friends. i love it because of the short ways to walk. very fast security check and boarding. very fast and good baggage claim: they put your bag/case with the hold up so you can pick it up fast from the belt. Employes very friendly and professional. I prefer to go to Dortmund as to Duesseldorf or Cologne. Because in Dortmund you dont have stress and every thing runs chilled and the connection via bus train taxi or car is good. cheap hotels near the airport. in front of the airport is a mc donalds and a gasstation and hotels. the airport is clean. enough toilets and seats. i alway have a pizza before my fligths at the terminal. the price is okay for an airport and it tastes fresh and good. i hope you´ll enjoy the airport like me. i flew from dortmund to porto, london, munich, riga, izmir and istanbul and to the Canary Islands with diffrent airlines and alway everything went well. because of the little operation at this airport your fligth will almost always be punctually. no delays. there is no airport in the world with 100% perfection. i give to this one 94%. thank you for reading my experiences. greetz Carlos :)"
1389,2292,Easy to access airport from Dresden Hbf (main train station) through S-Bahn S2 train. Check in/bag drop was fast and efficient. Security at the airport requires all passengers backpacks (carry on baggage/under-seat items) to be checked. Only one restaurant and one duty free store open - more than enough considering the 10 or so flights from the airport each day. Very few places to charge mobile phones/laptops. No airport Wi-Fi.
1390,2295,"Small and efficient. Unfortunately not much to do there while waiting as a part of the airport was blocked for a private event. Wifi very slow. Toilets were disgusting, they should really clean them!"
1391,2296,"Little and well organised, boarding less then 20 min, security check less then 10 min, one duty free shop, little coffee/bar, often used by business travellers to fly e.g. in the domestic area or used by young people in the holidays to start into vacation in south + east europe - quit and comfortable, time-saving."
1392,2297,This day in 2010 was very cold and it snowed endless. I was afraid because I thourgh my flight will cancel but the airport staff cleared the snow fast. So I flew to Munich. Good job Dresden Airport! (;
1393,2298,A nice little airport in the middle of Saxony. Usually all Flight are on time. The terminal is very comfortable and clean and there is a friendly check in personal. I'm loving to fly from Dresden International Airport. Excellent airport!
1394,2299,"Small, nice airport, short distances. Only 10 minutes from leaving the car until reaching the gate - very nice. Continuous increasing of routes. if you are lucky you can see big Airbuses (A380) arriving or leaving due to EADS maintenance in DRS."
1395,2300,"The only airport in Germany that I know of in which the announcements are only made in German and not in English. Unfortunately you won't find any decent food airside, I didn't check landside. Other than that, the airport is quite nice for the few flights per day that it has."
1396,2305,"The shortages during the Corona period have now been eliminated, but DUS does not remain a relaxing airport. A few months ago, thanks to overly long and poorly organized security checks, we barely managed to catch the flight, arriving half an hour before check-in began. Now I was literally shouted at by some uniformed lady when I tried to approach the (free) 'all passports' counter with a German passport... You have to look for politeness at other airports."
1397,2306,"Mostly crowded and baggage came really late, although there are supermarkets and restaurants that work until midnight and on sundays."
1398,2307,"Already in the queue three quarters of an hour before check-in, and just managed to get on the plane? This is only possible in DUS! - Check in very slow (OK - lots of complicated cases and passport constellations and visa situations, that's why we couldn't check in online) - the bouncer doesn't let us into security check C and sends us to security A/B - half an hour of walking..."
1399,2308,"Has gotten worse since Covid and Heinemann has taken over the DutyFree, less long haul flights and crowded. Otherwise not as bad as many reviews say (sometimes it‘s considered one of the worst airports). The check-in has gotten worse to."
1400,2309,Limited food in Terminal A Schengen section after passport control. No power sockets there either apart from under cafe bar table but plug wouldnt insert
1401,2310,The Dus airport isnt that Big and its Great! I found the Gate easy. The people at the Airport were very nice too.
1402,2311,Hey Düsseldorf airport is a good airport it is not a small airport but as well not a big airport I like this airport its a easy airport
1403,2312,"there are not a lot of planes landing here but it’s still a special airport there is a nice lounge where you can view all of the planes. It is very kid friendly and it’s nice seeing 737, a320, 767, 757 small planes or special military planes landing here very good"
1404,2314,- Fast check-in - seating requirement was fulfilled - close to my hometown - well public transportation - calm athmosphere - friendly and helpful staff
1405,2315,"nice small airport in the middle of germany, fast check-in and security checks, short ways, good traffic connections to train and highways. tram and taxis in front of the airport. personal is very friendly and cooperative."
1406,2316,"didn't transfer our checked in bag to another plane, even after confirmation with the airline worker."
1407,2317,"Security is a pain in the butt, especially with liquids. Food quality is very good and the airport is clean although the airport has a mouse issue"
1408,2320,nice airport lol ususally the airport i fly to the most/to go home BUT there are mice in the airport so 4 stars overall nice fast security customs ect
1409,2322,"Very dirty. There was rubbish everywhere, spilled liquids, etc. The toilet in departure area C16 was completely dirty. When you cut back on service staff, you realise that it is not the managers who ensure customer satisfaction."
1410,2323,"For the first time, I experienced getting out of an airplane and being able to remain in the security area for the onward flight without further security checks. GREAT / FINALLY"
1411,2326,"Well, ex-military airport and the classic among the low-cost jetties (a port is not). Everything is super small, everything is manageable. Food/coffee is OK, but if you are flying internationally you should drink your coffee BEFORE passport control, after which there is only one toilet in relaxation areas."
1412,2327,There weren't many shops but there was a McDonalds and a coffee shop. Everything was speedy and easy. The terminal was very quiet and not crowded at all so I enjoyed it
1413,2331,"The main issue with Hahn is that it is in the middle of nowhere and the transport options are limited to the Ryanair sponsored coach. However, it is a good sized airport for passing through hassle free."
1414,2332,"Airport hotel close by, direct Flixbus from Hahn to FRA, fairly large terminal with two sections (cargo facility kind of look), couple of restaurants as well, former military airport with long runway (4km?)."
1415,2334,Not much to do when having a long layover. Visiting interesting attractions in the area by bus or car rental isn't cheap either.Luckily there is a golf course across.
1416,2335,Unfortunately not much to do in the area if having a long lay over. Wi Fi is free just for an hour. Buses to certain attractions aren't cheap. Same for car rentals. Luckily there is a nice golf course right across where some quality time can be spent.
1417,2336,"Free visitors platform, nice and clean airport, small and efficient with good connection to public transport"
1418,2337,"Very nice regional airport with an air sport club, new terminal and the legendary air ship Zeppelin. Also very good restaurant called Volare and a coffe/snack bar in the terminal and at the boarding gate. Furthermore a great visitors terrace for spotters etc. Also travel agencies and a little shop where you can buy books, ice cream and more."
1419,2338,"great Airport, new Terminal and this Airport has an Air Sport Club with Gliders.... etc."
1420,2339,"Very nice modern regional airport, close to the town, Great staff."
1421,2340,small and efficient airport. a little old style but that only adds to its charm.
1422,2341,Brilliant airport
1423,2342,1 star on food and retail cause the 1 hour I was there I couldn't get a sprite; the vending machine wasn't working.
1424,2346,"I generally like this Airport. It's not so big, you don't have to go such long ways and find your way around"
1425,2347,"Excellent modern, efficient and clean airport! Off the plane, through immigration and bags collected within 30 minutes"
1426,2348,Security check nearly not to be planned due to gap of personnel. Even the fast lane is only opened depending of the staffing ...
1427,2349,Security fast lane changes entrance from terminal 2 (mornings) to 1 (afternoons) without signs leading to the one open
1428,2350,"Employees at the Security Check were very rude and unfriendly. I usually do not have this experience at Hamburg Airport, but this time the staff was very rude and unfriendly. Sad to see at such a good airport!"
1429,2356,"HAJ implemented a slot-based security check, and priority passes (like SkyPriority) aren't valid anymore. However, you can book a timeslot even when you are here - so you can bypass the wait easily. Also, the business lounge is pretty small with no food (just snacks)."
1430,2360,Easy to reach airport. Check-in and boarding went well. Staff nice and helpful. Always happy to travel from Hanover to far away places. Airport very clean including the toilet. There is always someone cleaning.
1431,2361,"Perfect airport with very short distances, enough shops. My home airport with connections to the whole world."
1432,2362,"Great airport to access as its on the Hannover S-Bahn network, decent airport architecture and great amount of facilities, shops and restaurants with friendly helpful staff..."
1433,2363,"We were planned to depart on the 25. But all flights were canncelled due several damages on the runway. We were sent home. The next day the airport was very crowded we departed with 1 hour Delay and when we arrived at esb our suitcases were gone. The ground Services left our them in hannover. We weren't the only people without suitcases. Like 30 people didn't get a suitcases. It took more than a week that the suitcases arrived. They arrived from haj,fra,muc."
1434,2369,"Cycled to the airport, small airport on a pretty island. Straight forward facilities and everything. Unique and pleasant experience indeed."
1435,2370,"No WiFi, but very nice restaurant, small waiting room, nothing special; Arrival by carriage. Everything perfect!"
1436,2371,"No WiFi, but very nice restaurant, small waiting room, nothing special; You don't even have to touch your luggage to the hotel, you travel by carriage. Everything is perfect here too!"
1437,2373,"Great small regional airport. Perfect if you reside nearby. Getting to the airport is ez by car. Parking lot is huge and affordable for a week trip. Check-In took a while (approx. 20-30 Min) as Agean had only 2 counters open. Security check was quick and friendly. Facilities were ok, even a small outside lounge with playground is available if you passed the security check. Food was only available from one store, there could be more variety."
1438,2375,"Airport is small, only one security check but it is quite fast. Most of the time you go to the aircraft by bus. On international flights you go through customs after security. The food options are limited after customs: only 2 vending machines. It seems that there is no WiFi at all."
1439,2376,"Easy to come there and it has everything what you need (and not need) at an airport. The flights are going to many places, but if you want to fly to a place that is very far away, you need to drive to Frankfurt."
1440,2377,"Good small airport near France, an alternative to Frankfurt and Air France and Strasbourg. Really hard to get through immigration quickly, 35 minutes at least! Little effort to be made at FKB."
1441,2380,20/20
1442,2381,"Cheap parking! (9€/day if you use P3) If you need to get there by public transport, use Baden-Baden train station and take bus 205 (about 3€)."
1443,2383,"Nice airport, friendly staff. Nice short distances, from the counter through the security check, which is very thorough, to the gate it takes less than 5 minutes. The path from the terminal to the plane is also OK. in terms of length, not comparable if there were bridges but at least no bus ride necessary."
1444,2384,Kassel is a small airport. The staff is very friendly and all facilities were clean and new. Free Wifi is possible if you ask at the counter for the key. Food at the Restaurant is very deliciouss and cheap.
1445,2385,"Nice litte aiport in the middle of germany! Very quick check in and friendly personal. There is a nice restaurant with a nice view to the runway and tasty food.In the terminal there are also several rental car provider like Hertz or Avis. How to get there,by car it takes about 10-15 minutes from the city center. Besides there is a good connection by bus from the main trainstation Kassel-Wilhemshoehe."
1446,2386,"Ugh, they took the inside of my lovely Playboy zippo lighter. The internet was misleading with if I could or could not. I guess I can not bring one with fuel inside...."
1447,2387,"Leipzig-Halle Airport is a small (regarding passenger service, air cargo business is huge!) airport in Germany. The terminal is not large so the way from check-in to the jetway is quite short. You probably pass security checks without long waiting queues. Don’t expect too much from the airport. It’s great for vacation travel but not the ultimate airport experience. For cheap car parking during vacation use the low-cost parking lot P20. Due an unexpected staff shortage and complicated COVID travel document checks we’d waited in the queue for check-in for one hour."
1448,2388,After customs there is a queue for passport control. only 4 windows!
1449,2389,very efficient airport. my luaggage was already on the belt when i arrived at the caroussell. train brings you easy and fast from the airport to the city
1450,2391,Good airport and not too busy. The airport is light and friendly. Everything works fast. Leipzig/Halle is the best airport in that region.
1451,2392,"Over all it is pretty okay for domestic flights. The check-in time is good. Only the terminal facilities after the security control are poor. If you arriving from a non Schengen country, the whole flight has to wait in a tiny room for passport-control. Baggage reclaim is very fast."
1452,2393,Strange airport in that it seems to be designed as a very long corridor across the top of the rail station. From bag drop to security and the departure gate involves a very long straight walk. Not a lot to see or do in the gate area.
1453,2394,"Leipzig Halle / Schkeuditz airport is a small regional airport. It is very convenient for the short ways between the gate and the baggage claim. However between check-in (which is close to the train station) and the gates, there is a 5 minutes walk which can be annoying."
1454,2395,"Check in guy was quite fine, but the distance from check in to security is kinda far. Like really far. We had to walk for at least kilometer at an airport where are 3 movements per hour and you'll still be in the rush hour (not counting in cargo.) WiFi nonexistent. There are few shops and a bakery and tons of car rentals."
1455,2396,"We tried the Lübeck - Bern route as an alternative to Hamburg - Zurich. It was a very positive experience. LBC is a very modern airport, small and very nice! Everywhere is impeccably clean, you can even judge the cleanliness. No airport stress, no long queues, cheap parking, even within a short walking distance, as well as a delicious airport bistro."
1456,2397,"It was a small regional airport, not much here other than a coffee shop, sold few snacks but nothing special"
1457,2398,"Very small airport - just a tent with a wooden floor :) After the customs only a little shop with some basic stuff (coffee, muffins, some newspapers etc.), no regular duty free shop, do not even think about any duty free shopping :) A few flights per day only. Very good transfer to Hamburg - buses waiting for a flight or transfering directly to a flight. The staff is fine."
1458,2399,The bus driver to Hamburg let me on bus for $0
1459,2404,"Small local airport if you live nearby, if you board several flights at the same time in the upper gates the building gets very crowded."
1460,2406,"Nice small airport, with short waiting times. Unfortunately, it closed immediately after the (late) arrival, so it was not possible to wait inside for further transport."
1461,2407,"Very worn out. Needs renovation and a little bit of love regarding facilities and renovation. But: small airport, very fast and efficient."
1462,2411,"Memmingen, as always, was very fast. It's possible to reach your car within 20minutes (+ baggage Claim). You've got free Wifi and Coffe Fellows."
1463,2412,This Airport is small but very nice. You don't have to wait long in front of the Check-in or the Security check. The new WiFi worked perfectly and Coffe Fellows is great as always. The way to the Airport is very short and parking doesn't coast that much.
1464,2413,Great airport for connections if your travel plans aren' affected by one of the constant strikes that happen now and then.
1465,2414,"This airport is very civilised and also clean, and despite its gigantic size it's very easy to navigate through if you have a connecting flight. The only thing that lacked was that the airport needs more stores included in the duty free because you can get bored of if quite easily on a long layover."
1466,2415,"Staff at the check-in and baggage drop were mostly unfriendly and not too helpful. I was in a need of duck which seemed to impossible to find, it should be basic accessory at the check-in counter/baggage drop."
1467,2416,Baggage claim took unacceptable long time. Train connection to the airport was under construction. Buses to replace train to the nearest train station were badly marked and even the airport staff seemed to be unaware which bus travellers should take to reach the actual train.
1468,2419,"It's a very nice airport with lots of views of the runways, it's easy to find your way around and sit well"
1469,2421,"We had to wait a little longer for our luggage. (When we arrived there was just rail replacement traffic... Nobody knew where to go or how to get away, everyone was annoyed and just sent you somewhere else)"
1470,2426,"Nice little airport, just lacking toilets at the gates after passport control. Quite and friendly otherwise."
1471,2427,"Check in and baggage drop-off quite a long queue, as only one counter.. No OLCI possible.. But fast Siko"
1472,2429,"Few flights, but still a huge queue at check-in... Online check-in was free as we still had to check in again normally. Staff seems overwhelmed. Only after the end of the check-in time, when the queue was still long but significantly shorter, did more employees come, the third one was very snippy."
1473,2430,Only minus point was Lufthansa staff at check-in. Asked for boarding pass to be re-printed and was answered very rudely if there was any problem with my phone.
1474,2431,"Nice small airport, on the Nürnberg U-Bahn so really easy to get to. Small but nicely and well designed with good efficient staff."
1475,2432,"Metro station (a train will depart every 10 minutes) and bus station are right outside the terminal building. WiFi is available everywhere and free to use. There are 5+ car rental companies, many food and retail stores. You can get from the aircraft to the metro station within 5 minutes of time. The Lounge can only be accessed when you arrive from a SCHENGEN country, but if you've got another flight, you can simply pass the security check again. Immigration and customs is always very quick. Baggage reclaim starts within 10 minutes from deboarding. You can walk straight outside when you've only got carry-on baggage with you."
1476,2433,"Airport is eay to get to. The metro rides takes only 12 minutes of your time if your starting poin is the main railway station. Bus connection is also available. Security check is super close and doesn't take very long. You're within 5 minutes of walking time at any point of the terminal, thus at any possible gate. WiFi is free and available everywhere. Departure hall 2 has many shops and there's plenty of bakeries as well. The Albrecht-Dürer-Lounge is between Security check and the first gates, so you won't need long to get to your boarding. Also, there's a 'silence room' near gate A14 where everyone can sit and relax. That area has been a biz area for Air Berlin passengers during the old times."
1477,2435,"We used this airport for flight to London Stansted and because we are from Prague, we came here by car and we used parking next to the enter of the terminal (it cost 56€ for 5 days, good price).The security control was fast with no problems. Not to many shops inside but it´s a small clean airport."
1478,2437,Great little airport. We were through check-in and security within 15 minutes. Parking prices are cheap and the staff is friendly. Here your holiday begins without stress from the first minute.
1479,2438,"Very good, small airport with a family atmosphere. :)"
1480,2439,small but nice
1481,2440,clean and efficient mini airport
1482,2441,"It is a very small airport, but very familar. The security controll is very fast, the lounge is small, but nice. Great small airport :)"
1483,2442,"Very nice little airport. Very quick check-in and quick through security. The lounge is very small, but basically offers everything you need: snacks, coffee, soft drinks, beer and wine. There is also a wide range of magazines."
1484,2444,small but nice !
1485,2445,"Very small but efficient, fast and friendly, especially the Heinemann Duty Free"
1486,2446,"Small airport, few connections. Cheap parking."
1487,2447,Lounge visit also for colleagues without FTL status
1488,2448,"Free Wifi for 3 hours, very nice. Check in was fast but they could have opened a bit earlier, since there were a lot of people in line already before opening the desks. Security was also quiet, but I found the staff to be a bit bad-humoured. Navigation through the airport was easy, with one big corridor with enough shops to refill during the delay and some cool features along the way such as some Xboxes and an electic bike to charge your phone."
1489,2449,"Orientation was very easy and we were done in a breeze. Baggage took a bit to arrive considering our flight was the only one and we couldn't go to the bathroom at first since they were cleaning and didn't offer and alternate choice. Didn't try using Wifi or lounge. No customs, Schengen zone."
1490,2450,Waited long for the baggage. We docked on at the terminal anyway there are Stairs insided the Terminal. For me that is bad planning
1491,2453,Got help by the staff at the Business Class counter of the Turkish Airlines. She is kind and helpful
1492,2454,"Just one terminal was open and I saw nowhere, that all people are going to use just the one open terminal"
1493,2455,"Incredibly expensive, €2.50 for ½ liter of water. Available in FRA for free from the dispenser or for €1"
1494,2456,"Not very many signs telling you where your airline check in is. Also, not a good process to checkin with customs official before going to bag drop. Security line is very confusing and agent who runs it acted more like the soup nazi than an agent. No directions and cold looks. Tried closing our line just as we got to front. Airport is clean and not too big.....just give yourself the full 2 hours."
1495,2457,"A solid three star airport, that is well resourced and clean. Nicely laid out and open and has metro access directly to the airport, which is a must in this day and age."
1496,2458,"As always, it was super cool to fly away from Sylt. All the employees are friendly and everything happens quickly. Apart from WiFi, everything is there and you can quickly get on the plane without long waiting times. Really great! There is probably no better airport..."
1497,2459,"As always, everything goes on at Sylter Intl. Airport very quickly. As always, the staff was very nice and helpful. My favorite airport"
1498,2460,Nice and pretty small airport. You can come to the City within 5 Minutes & to the Beach within 10 Minutes. The Staff is very kind & the food in the Lounge is brilliant. You can arrive just-in-time which makes this to one of the best Airport's in Europe for me. Also you are very fast in e.g. Munich or Zurich.
1499,2461,Nice and small airport. Good connection with public transport despite the small size. Good time management. Very punctual and friendly staff!
1500,2462,3€ fee to get on the airport area. 1 hour parking for free. I juat waited 5 minutes for my baggage.
1501,2465,Don't like that you have to pay parking even if you want to drop a rental car. The airport itself is actually quite ok for its size.
1502,2466,"While the airport facilities and post-security-check options are more than limited, I have never experienced such a fast and unproblematic security check. Check-In and Security Check did not take more than 2 minutes. A very interesting experience."
1503,2467,"We arrived here by train and it a shame that there's no direct route to this area. We live in Muenster and it took about 3 hours by train. If the train is late, you might miss the bus to the airport. Best to have a friend drop you off and pay for their gas/time. Other than that, it's a small airport was basic facilities."
1504,2468,The only complaint I have is how unreachable this airport is. There is no direct(er) train connection and the busses that run are a true nightmare. There should be a direct connection in cooperation with i.e. Ryanair to make this worthwhile.
1505,2469,Not very easy to reach. Is far from the highway. Inside is comfortable and mid-big. Check in desks are fast. Security controls are in the average. The gates are very efficients. The boardings are via bus/foot. The aircraft park zone is limited.
1506,2470,"A typical little Ryanair airport I wasn't expecting a lot from,but in the end it turned out to be quite nice and passenger friendly. Always be a bit earlier though,as the lines tend to get quite long."
1507,2471,"I've flown to Lappeenranta several times. Always been very satisfied! ;) Of course there's no comparison to Frankfurt Airport, but you can pass the time on the outside terrace."
1508,2473,Nice and very well organised airport. A lot good bars and restaurants to sit down and eat something.
1509,2475,"very bad airport...no facilities, rude immigration officers good thing is sanbra lounge bar with entrance fee cca.25 USD snacks and drinks and wifi included. All in all for capital city bad organized airport"
1510,2476,"The airport itself is not a masterpiece but it serves the purpouse. You can get to/from anytime you want by local tro-tro. The amazing part of my whole experience was airport stuff, helpful, kind and warm. Exceeded luggage was not a problem at all. Only problem i had, was finding ATM to pay my ending visa. For non-Ghanaian, filling the long immigration paper might be a little bit to much as a first experience in Ghana."
1511,2478,Stop in Abidjan
1512,2480,"There was WiFi, but not a lot of restaurants and facilities. Famous for the road crossing! The airport was very clean and because Gibraltar is small, no problem for transport to the airport. Check in was quite fast, along with the security check. Wifi was fast and stable."
1513,2481,Every time I go to Gibraltar I just love the dodgy landing Every time I go to Gibraltar I just love the dodgy landing
1514,2482,got diverted to Malaga Airport as the weather was to bad for Gibraltar . captain did try 2 x but was then diverted to Malaga Airport
1515,2483,"BA could do with having more than 3 check-in desks open - we waited for at least 20 minutes and there weren't even that many people in the queue. Apart from this, the airport was fine and got through security in just a few minutes. Nice views of the rock and the runway too"
1516,2485,"Fantastic airport,modern,bright,friendly,fast security,nice shops,and a nice terrace to sit out on whilst waiting for your flight,this is a lovely airport,highly recommend it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
1517,2486,"Gibraltar's New Terminal is now complete and is a vast Improvement of the old one :) Check in and security are quick and facilities are fine :) Baggage hall is a bit of a muff though baggage can take a while and it appears that the upstairs one is not being used. Other than that, It's fine :D"
1518,2489,Tiny little thing
1519,2490,It's a small airport. At the end of the summer season we moved swiftly and smoothly from arrival by bus to the gate. Walked to the aircraft in early evening. Trouble free departure. On the tarmac was an EasyJet aircraft that has a technical problem. There were additional pax flying with TUi.
1520,2491,"Convenient airport with sufficient F&B options, as well as friendly staff and great Wi-Fi. Moreover, car rental pick-up and drop-offs are right on front of the terminal building."
1521,2492,"Preveza Aktion AB airport is an airport which could be much better.... getting to the airport is easy you have one road to follow which it bring you to the airport (you can go by car or take the bus from Preveza or Lefkada. About the check in the check for my flight had 3 check in desks open so it went quit quick but you have to bring your baggage to the X-Ray scanner at the behind the firs check in desk food and retail drinks services : the airport hase on shop whit little snacks, coffee and drinks which it's ok . It has and one little sop with travel stuff and other things but this is all ! About the Lounge it has one only big lunge for all flights which is a little noisy . The security check ... one only security desk and door so you have to wait a lot and the security check is no efficient as the others airport ! This airport is a good solution for the area with low cost flight during summer periods."
1522,2493,"About Preveza / Aktion AB airport , It could be a full year service airport and be better than this like airport after it sale ! It's use full airport but abandoned airport . Getting to the airport is easy only one way to go and you can't get lost ! You have also a lot of Taxi and a bus to Preveza or Lefkada ! Food and retails services are poor and expensive ! The lounge is so small and not so good but is quiet ... Terminal facilities except the car rent offices nothing els ... The baggage clams has very old systems and electrical problems (blackout for no reasons) the screens indicated your flight are so old which they are not working well or working at all , baggage are coming slow and any customs check when going out of baggage claim , only one police officer ! I wish that this airport be renovated because is a very useful airport for the region and it could be a nice and good airport !"
1523,2494,"Chhecj-in in the ""old fashion way"" long lines...forst check-in and then again long lines at bagage security/delivery...."
1524,2498,Aegean Lounge better than LH because there are also toilets. Quite a large buffet. ATH but quick Siko and easy to reach by train
1525,2501,"One of the biggest airports I've been to. A lot of people, not good signalling where to go. Most of the things are in Greek, and it's not user friendly if you are in a rush."
1526,2502,"I flow a lot of time from and to the ATH airport. Getting to the airport by public transportations using metro, Proastiakos train or at least you have 4 buses with one it goes to the central bus station of Athens for bus connections to other cities witch is difficult to get there without a taxi but overall is about 1h of transportations to go to Athens city. Taxis are very expensive and don’t take bank cards do be careful. Having a lot of check in desks because it’s a big airport it was easy to find ur check-in desk, the check in was very fast using the baggage drop method with now waiting and a very kind Aegean airlines staff to check our baggage wight and propose us to print for free ur boarding pass in case we run out of battery on ur smartphones. The security check is extremely easy to find when you have the priority pass and is so fast and without pressure to do everything fast, the non priority pass are in an other area but they are fast efficient and proven and also not very stressful. The terminal facilities are not so modern like other airports but they are good and you can find what you want fast and easy. About food and retail services you have a lot of choices and they are good."
1527,2503,"I flow a lot of time from and to the ATH airport. Getting to the airport by public transportations using metro, Proastiakos train or at least you have 4 buses with one it goes to the central bus station of Athens for bus connections to other cities witch is difficult to get there without a taxi but overall is about 1h of transportations to go to Athens city. Taxis are very expensive and don’t take bank cards do be careful. The terminal facilities are good but you have to walk a long hol to get to the baggage claim, connecting flight or check in area and the immigration/customs, be careful to not be confused and end up to the boarding gates while looking for the baggage claim. The baggage claim is not so fast so you have to wait some minutes before starting delivering your bagages (it’s because the arrival terminal is fare a way from the bagage claim). Found and retail services are good and the prices wasn't so expensive at the time."
1528,2504,"You can reach the airport by bus (5 Euros extra ticket single ticket is not valid) departure frequency 10-15 minutes, route time about 1 hours. But you can use the metroline (10 Euros extra ticket which is valid for transfer also so the normal ticket is included, which means you have 90 minutes to travel). Departure frequency 30-40 minutes, but you can also use the suburban railway to the nearest metro station thats means the railway departure frequency is 20-25 minutes. Airport is ok, quite big. It is better to be a little bit earlier at the airport. You can buy cheap water at the dutty free."
1529,2505,"This airport is out of the city. To reach the city you have to use the metroline to the city center. The ticket is 10 Euros, which is not really cheap. Information board was placed really correctly. I found the metro / railway station really easy."
1530,2506,Athens transport on strike this day. Arranged private transfer thru a company I know there. Arrived 4 hours before departure. Lounge crowded.
1531,2509,Chania has been improving steadily since my first visit there in the year 2000. They seem to have an ongoing plan to upgrade the facility and it certainly seems to be working...if only Gatwick would adopt a similar proactive approach!
1532,2510,"What a polar opposite to Gatwick! Clean and modern facilities, staff who actually smile, friendly immigration officials. Quick and efficient baggage reclaim."
1533,2511,The airport of Chania was very clean and its interior was looking as it was new. It wasn't crowded at all so everything went smooth. The duty free shop was better than in every other airport that I flew from! There were reasonable prices and discounts for many products to choose from! This airport is a top example for efficiency and good thinking for the passengers!
1534,2512,"The airport was very clean and the interior looks like it is new. It wasn't crowded at all so everything was efficient. The duty free shop was better than in all of the other airports that I flew from, having reasonable prices and discounts for many things to choose from. This airport is an tru example for the other ones that are out there! Loved it and hope to come back soon!"
1535,2513,The passport control for arrivals was very small and it took to long to wait because of the shortage of personal. Be carefull of taxis because they are really expensive. For a 6 min drive to the hotel was 20 EUR!
1536,2515,"A lovely airport, not long had a refurbishment. Very spacious and plenty of seating allocated around the airport. Great views of the apron and was very impressed with the food and retail services on offer."
1537,2516,"A lovely airport - recently had a refurbishment. Very spacious, lots of seating and great views of the apron. Was very impressed with the selection of food and retail services."
1538,2517,Departures at Chania is a much smoother experience than arrivals! Much better facilities than in Arrivals! Duty free is excellent and overall facilities are first rate!
1539,2520,Great little airport when its not too busy. Can be a nightmare during peak holiday season having such a small lounge.
1540,2522,"Check-in, two planes, 5 gates. Quite quickly, but it was 3.30 (gr) so there was no normal traffic. Boarding On time. Not enough seating and expensive in the duty free zone"
1541,2523,"Nice renovated airport, large arrivals hall. They quickly handed over luggage after charter flight RR3603 (POZ-CFU)"
1542,2530,Airport way too small for the number of people. Very crowded and not even enough seats for half the people. Toilets incredibly dirty
1543,2535,Very small airport for the amount of passengers. No room around gates to queue so passengers just block the walkway and seating areas when trying to board. Same situation within the duty free area. One restaurant and a few cafes with minimal seating.
1544,2536,Pretty easy and smooth experience. It was busy but checkin for Aegean air was fast. Security went quick. It was an evening flight during summer peak travel
1545,2539,Security and checking where wuick not many places to eat though and our flight was delayed by about an hour
1546,2544,spretty small airport but works for me it was great and the services were good the toilet was nice but still a toilet.
1547,2546,"Karpathos airport is very nive because you don't have to wait long time to check in it is easy, the terminal has a nice view of the gates and runway, it has duty-free shops and mini markets but also a cafeteria where you can have a coffe while waiting for your flight ."
1548,2547,A very nice Island
1549,2550,Nice small airport.
1550,2551,An little Airport.
1551,2555,"EFL is a small airport. Has a few shops but it's mostly quiet. Bag collection was slow and suitcase was destroyed, though it may not be the airports fault. Immigration is literally 2 desks only. No electronic passport gates. No jetways so awesome walking on the ramp right next to the runway."
1552,2556,"Very good for a regional airport, ok shops not much to eat or drink. It has enough gates and seats for the passengers it has"
1553,2557,Lovely little airport. No need to arrive too early. Best snack bar is actually outside the terminal on the left hand side.
1554,2560,"Very small and dated airport. The terminal is being expanded. On the plus side: air conditioning in the check in area, working and updated monitor screens and fast Wi-Fi. On the minus side: long queue for check-in (your checked luggage will be scaled and then you'll have to queue again to position it on the belt), long queue for security and very cramped airside departures. Transportation options are also limited."
1555,2561,"It is quite a few years since we have been to Kefallinia. The first visit back in 1984 was ""interesting"" with very basic Arrivals and Departures facilities. The current airport facilities were under construction at this time. We returned to Kefallinia in 1993 and in true Greek style, construction was still under way. Having said all that, the facilities are what you would expect from an airport that caters mainly for holiday trade."
1556,2563,"A small airport with good facilities. It is managed by FRAPORT. I think FRAPORT invented a lot of money for that airport, because it looks so modern. There is burger king and starbucks inside the terminal. Duty free is not too expensive. To reach the airport there is only few bus direct to the plane if you wouldn't like checked in baggage you will be at the airport 2,5 hours before the departure. Really fast security check."
1557,2564,Small airport. Perfect capacity for such use. We were on time and the navigation through the airport was very quick.
1558,2567,"This is a very old airport and so has only been adapted to the smaller aircraft from the older times of holidays. Very long waits for customs as there is only two stands, departures is very, very small and for so many flights this is not good enough. Check in is very outdated, you have to walk you’re hold baggage to security unlike modern airports, duty free is tiny and there are only two food options."
1559,2570,The terminal is under construction at the moment and is very small. Will be better after rebuild i think
1560,2571,"One of the smallest airport, I've been to! When all tourists come at once, you'll have to wait about an hour just to check-in."
1561,2574,Really nice mediterrian feeling airport i really recommend for all aviation lovers because of the landing
1562,2575,"There are regular buses from the ferry port to the airport, but the traffic was quite heavy when I travelled. Maybe best to leave in plenty of time. There was no queue at the BA bag drop when I arrived, so I moved straight through to security. It is not well signposted, but easily found in the small airport. Security took 10 mins. There are a couple of food outlets, both of which had queues. I went straight through passport control. The Non-EU departure lounge is is large with plenty of seating. It also has another food place, which also had a queue. The airport had relaxed feel, possibly due to to the lack of numerous Ryanair (in any of its disguises) flights."
1563,2581,Awesome!!
1564,2582,"The MJT airport is a recently renovated airport, to get to the airport is only by bus or car/taxi and is not so far away from Mytiline city. The check in is fast but can be very crowded because of the little space icon the check in area. The security check is quit fast and efficient on a normal day out summer holiday season. The terminal facilities are modern clean but you don’t find a lot of food and retails services because the airport is small but what you find is ok for the little airport. The boarding is on the plane is by bus and stairs."
1565,2583,The old terminal was too small for the amount of passengers. The securtity was a mess and not enough seats in the waiting area. I heard the new terminal is perfect in size and solved all there problems! Really cool runway with much brake action!!
1566,2584,"A brand new small regional airport. Nice and far more comfortable than the older one. There is a problem with car parking and car rental companies are located in the parking of the old airport, so there is a transfer. That means more time spending. Also security control isn't working well, as the screening machine is very short and then you have to grab all your belongings and walk somewhere else to dress or pack again."
1567,2585,"first time in the NEW airport of Mytilini, its big with shops and resturants etc it opened at the begginig of february 2020, it is called ODYSSEAS ELYTIS its beautiful and big the terminal is 7,185 m2"
1568,2592,"TINY airport, but it does the job. Quite an experience flying into an airport which is literally a runway and 1 tiny house."
1569,2593,They scan your bags and then you can check them in. After you’ve checked in you can go to an outside area with a little cafe. When it’s time for boarding you go back in to the airport and in to the departure lounge. Which in this case is tiny. You get on a bus and ride for less than 30 seconds to the aircraft. They actually managed to take off 10 minutes early!
1570,2596,GOOD WIDI TRANSFER TAKES AGES FROM LINDOS AS IT STOPS IN FALIRAKI QEUES AT CHECK IN NO LONGER THAN 20 MINS SECURITY DID STOP US.
1571,2597,Small but really cosy airport. The local bus departs not so frequently but is was correct. If you would like to rent a car it is cheaper to rent from the airport.
1572,2599,"Very clean and efficient airport! I have never seen such an organised boarding for a low cost flight before! Here you can make some great planespotting, with even 787's flying from Rhodes! :) Thank you Rhodes, hope to come back soon! :)))"
1573,2601,A kind of hectic first experience especially if you have booked your trip through a travel agency and you have to navigate your way to the right bus that will take you to your hotel. One of our baggages has arrived at the destinaion not in the same state as when we dropped it off in Bucharest.
1574,2602,"Check-in took a long time, however once past that, security queue was virtually non existent. After security, it's straight to the gates, no long walks through duty free like other airports. However the prices in duty free are extortionate. Seating around the gate was limited, I sat on the floor as I waited for the inbound flight to arrive. Boarding process was efficient, all in all quite a pleasant experience."
1575,2603,"Check-in had a bit of a wait but got there, security took about 5 mins so was great, it has a section for intra-Schengen flights and outer-Schengen flights separate so very organised. Free strong WIFI for 2 hours which is very good and has a selection of food restaurants. Very good airport."
1576,2604,"Burger king very crowded, terminal 2 not clean and old, toilets are not clean at all, duty free was a mess, at Security they literally throw your bags through the machine and very very unfriendly staff (except at check in)"
1577,2606,Landing on this airport is acrobatic stund.... :D but as we landed so we give our luggage very fast. In out was wery heat but climation on airport is very good so we feel good when we wait on luggages. But runaway on this airport as very shoort so plane has a lot to hinder.
1578,2608,Airport with great spotting positions.
1579,2609,A very nice Island.
1580,2612,Normal small airport. Nothing really to do but there are 3 cafes/restaurants. Security was very fast.
1581,2613,Its a newly renovated airport ! Its still a bit small for the traffic at the summer season but its better than the previous years mess ! Its a modern little airport that can serves all narowbodies airplanes with international routes and the port facilities are really good with good atmosphere . This airport really represents the island in the best way possible its a small gem !
1582,2614,Small airport currently in the phase of extension. It gets very crowded and confusing. I appreciated at least the fast security check and quite a nice view from the (dirty) windows.
1583,2615,"The Santorini airport is undersized for the amount of traffic travelling through it. Lines are long, unless you’ve got status with the airline you’re flying. Once through security there isn’t much room to wait. If you head upstairs to the terrace it’s nice to sit outside but hard to hear the announcements and there is no screen with fligh status on the terrace. Once you head back down into the main terminal area, the temperature is quite warm (even on a cool October evening) from all the bodies. Tempers flare as passengers get frustrated waiting for a delayed flight for which very little communication is given."
1584,2620,"The best place for plane spotting right next to the runway! Even at the small size of this clean and organised airport, there was a big Duty Free store upstairs in the Non-Schengen gates area with plenty of reasonable priced stuff to buy. The only inconvenience that I had during my time at the airport was the one hour delay that was followed by an unpredicted baggage allowance check, which I do know that is not the airport's fault but Wizzair's procedure maybe when flights are delayed."
1585,2621,Very efficient airport because of the great staff that also helped me with the directions to the bus stop in front of the domestic terminal as it was my first visit on this paradise island. I have to say that I've never seen such a clean airport in my entire trips! The public transport from the airport to the main town and then on the road to Koukounaries was as good as the cleanliness in the public bathrooms! The tickets can be bought from the bus driver and for 3 euros you can get in the main town or continue onward on anther bus in about 5 to 30 minutes (the bus from the airport to Skiathos Town is every 20 minutes).
1586,2622,"Clean and tidy, new airport with good services for travellers. I travelled late on a Sunday night (20:25 flight) so the upstairs restaurant was not open. This limited the range available but there was still a small cafe before passport control, alongside the duty free shop; and a smaller cafe with more limited range once through passport control. If you are hungry, you would be better eating at the café before you go through passport control. For reference, a large, draft Mythos beer is €6 so not cheap, even for Greece."
1587,2624,As I'm sure a lot of people will say but Skiathos is Europe's St Marteen and it literally is! Truly amazing airport!
1588,2625,Skiathos airport is one of my favourite airports Because of how small it is I love Skiathos airport because of the short runway and I arrive at 757 Feeling the full power of the brakes feeling the full power of the brakes. Very small airport with only two restaurants duty-free and two toilets but for what there is it’s a very good quality and hygienic there is free Wi-Fi in the airport that is fast I don’t think there was a longe at this airport I’ve been there four times i’ve been there four times Each experience was enjoyable as each one each experience was enjoyable as each one!
1589,2626,Very basic airport as expected but I was surprised at security the staff seemed more concerned chatting rather than checking the luggage on the x-ray.
1590,2627,"A nice small airport that is for sure a treasure in todays high flying and often over crowded departure lounges etc. A small time feel with a great and friendly service oriented staff, would travel here again in the future.."
1591,2628,"Nice little airport, but little seating in departure lounge"
1592,2629,"Absolutely perfect for spotting planes. Otherwise like all the smaller airports over Greece, lazy service and slow baggage reclaim."
1593,2630,"Interesting airport with quiet policy which means there no announcement. I think it has some design error such as security check and check in area. There no big separation between SRA area and open area. It has huge waiting (departure hall) it looks like BGY airport (Bergamo). There are no gate tubes, so there are bus gates and only one or two walking gates. Plane parking positions are too far from the building."
1594,2631,After the enlargement a few years ago its a very good airport. Checkinhall is very manageable. Fastest security check I have seen. All in one in my opinion its one of the best airports.
1595,2632,A great modern clean and efficient terminal. From check in and through security in under 20 minutes. a great airport to use.
1596,2633,"Arrived from Bristol on 31 Aug about 10 minutes early. A very good experience just 45 minutes from touching down, Quickly through passport control and baggage collection. 45 minutes in all from touch down to leaving the airport on our transfer coach. Well done."
1597,2634,"The newly opened part of this airport is pretty nice, much better than the old building. Everything is fine except getting to and from the airport. There is a terrible public transit connection between the airport and Thessaloniki."
1598,2635,The new builded parts of the airport help reducing the waiting time in front of the security control. Excellent shopping facilities. The new A3 lounge is superb.
1599,2636,"Really quick and easy at a quiet time, 10 min max to having the doors opened and being in a taxi. Great, staff were very friendly"
1600,2637,"Airport under construction. Getting to is easy and with good signage on the highway. Check-in needs to be desired more efficiently. You have to queue twice and the process goes as follows> you queue once for your boarding card and the luggage tagging. Then you get your luggage by yourself to another queue for scanning and handing it over to the security agent. This situation persists many years. I hope that the airport expansion (new terminal, facilities and runway) will be a major improvement. Security check was easy and painless. Wifi was available for free, with an easy connection process and fast speeds. Food services were limited to two shops with a decent offering on coffee, snacks, pizza, etc. But this could be also due to the Covid-19 restrictions. Lounge not available yet."
1601,2638,"The airport isn't bad, It has all the items an airport has but has quite a lot of duty-free shops which is nice."
1602,2639,"Fraport have changed the layout of the airport with the only purpose to create more space for retail use. Even with a few flights departing at the same time, the waiting area is so crowded. When it comes to the extra shenghen departures lounge, the things get worse. No space at all. Finally, the food service is too expensive. Hope this will change with the new terminal (which apparently will look smaller than I would expect)."
1603,2640,"Getting to the airport was very good, the check-in took very long because of limited space, wi-fi was good in my opinion. But there was only 1 big shop, and two mini restaurances. No lounge, baggage claim was ok."
1604,2642,"We tend not to use the transfer coach dependent on time of arrival and use taxi's both ways to and from airport for speed. The airport itself is much improved in recent years and the lounges are clean with excellent viewing windows. Toilets are adequate, but typically greek."
1605,2643,The airport overall was great but it's only a small airport like Liverpool the facility's include: 1) a duty free shop 2) a bakery 3) a airport lounge It was all we needed though...
1606,2644,Very nice airport. Lots of room and seats and good views of the outside. There is a lack of shops but that is to be expected from a small airport that mainly operates regional flights.
1607,2645,"it was quite good, although its a small airport with minimalist colours..........................................................................ddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddfdkdfefsffrfurfyfriufrigvriu;rgrf8rrgrgruirdfreo9f9re"
1608,2646,"Small airport, but a lot better than it was a few years ago (when busy, people had to queue outside in the blistering heat). Only really has one place to eat & one shop. Very expensive for soft drinks. Check-in etc was fine, though I'd imagine that in the busier months of July & August, it may be quite crowded."
1609,2647,"Zakynthos airport was usually crowded and lacked the presence of any working air conditioning. Not many restaurants/shops to pick from, and of the ones that were there, they were over-priced."
1610,2648,"Seamless arrivals and baggage claim, through in 15 minutes."
1611,2649,"Very busy with 5-6 Thomson/Thomas Cook aircraft (752/753/A32x/738) departing within a short time period. Small terminal, acceptable but uncomfortable after 4 hours sitting waiting for our flight."
1612,2654,"Due to the health crisis, services are reduced to the strict minimum. The Air France lounge where only FB members are accepted, but no guests..."
1613,2655,Immigration took their time getting to the booth. Didn't ask any questions. Didn't even look at or ask about my dog in my carry-on. Airport nicer and cleaner than we expected. Poor WiFi.
1614,2656,So many peoples in safety check. 25 mins queued to pass it.. Directly go to boarding gate. Safety check's engorgement created a late for few passengers. The flight took-off with 10 mins late
1615,2657,"To spend 2hrs on checkin with all other passengers just for one flight, that's a nightmare!!! How can AirFrance allow this? When they know this is the one and only flight they operate that evening??"
1616,2658,Speed
1617,2659,Boarding lounge a little too noisy
1618,2660,"We arrived too early and went hiking around, which nearly made us miss the flight. Security que was long. Lounge was OK. Duty free was well-developed for its size, they were mainly souvenir."
1619,2662,Security check took way too long! Didn't have enough space to add more desks for security checks. UA lounge was okay.
1620,2664,"The airport in Guam is small but very convenient. Everything runs smoothly and you can go from check in to boarding in under 30 minutes (at least from my experience). We arrived two hours before the flight without competing online check in and we still had to time to grab dinner, do some shopping and arrive at the boarding area minutes before boarding began."
1621,2667,"A tired airport that isn't laid out or signed clearly, but it gets the job done and has its charms. Live marimba music makes up for just about anything."
1622,2668,"The terminal is somewhat tired and disorganized, but the live marimba music more than made up for any shortcomings."
1623,2669,La Aurora Airport is guatemala's only airport wich suites fine they have to work on tourisim but its realy a fantastic airport Theres never a line at coustoms!
1624,2670,"Getting to the airport at 8 P.M. was very easy but the roads of Guatemala City are very damaged, check in was super fast and I was one of the first people to check-in, security was fast, didn't use WiFi, food can improve, and I didn't used any lounge."
1625,2671,Casa del Ron Lounge had a 10-15 min wait (didn't go in) and Copa Lounge was closed. Everyone goes through the same line for security (no separate Business/precheck line).
1626,2672,"This airport was definitely a culture shock to an American like myself. The outside of the airport was quite fascinating; people everywhere. They were vending, selling pretty much everything you could need (food, gifts, etc.), and it was a bit of a jumbled mess. Many of the duty free shops had been closed (forgot the reason why, exactly), but there were plenty of other stores selling rather cute little trinkets and gifts, as well as food. The terminal facilities were okay, but none of the flight information displays were functioning for some reason.... That was rather inconvenient. But, the people who worked at the airport were VERY hospitable and extremely nice, and that made my trip so much better."
1627,2674,"Great airport, central america second best airport, of course the Panama city airport is kind of better, but pretty similar both of them! So proud of the Aurora Guatemala city Intl. Airport, grey service, variety of restaurants and duty free."
1628,2675,Staff were very helpful in returning my lost camera tripod to my hotel. Excellent service.
1629,2678,Small and cramped arrivals hall with limited toilet facilities. Arriving passengers often have to face a lengthy queue for a taxi as the islands taxi drivers only work when they want to.
1630,2679,"Relatively easy to use airport terminal, check in is fairly speedy, security not always so, the staff are not friendly in this area and bark at you. The departure 'lounge' has a small cafeteria & a WH Smith outlet & the obligatory duty free shop. Toilet facilities are cramped (not as much so as in arrivals tho). Walking time to the aircraft is minimal."
1631,2680,"There are regular buses from around the island to the airport. There was a short queue at check-in, but it moved quickly. Sice the flights are further apart than at may airports, security doesn't take too long. There are few services airside, but enough for the number of passengers. The staff in cafe are very friendly and helpful."
1632,2681,The aircraft parks close to a covered walkway to the terminal building. From there it is a straightforward route through to the airport exit. There is a reasonably regular bus service from the airport to most parts of the island.
1633,2682,"There is a reasonably regular bus service across the island, so getting there is straightforward. The airport is relatively quiet, so checking and security were not a problem. Two minutes through security was probably my quickest ever for an airport with scanners. There was some internal remodelling work being done, which probably created a confusing detour through departures and security. There is plenty of space airside and plenty of seating when I was there. There is a shop and a restaurant."
1634,2683,This is a small airport and there was work being carried out at the time which changed the normal layout. There is a kiost in the arrivals hall were bus passes can be bought. There are relatively frequent buses to from the airport to all parts of the island.
1635,2684,"Easy to get to and from the airport with the regular bus services. Terminal is modern and clean. Nothing fancy, but it's good enough for a small island airport. The wifi is intermittent, with a few problems but generally ok."
1636,2685,"Everything was good. The airport, when we traveled around lunchtime was not busy. We went straight through security very quickly and into the fairly small duty free shop. Airside refreshments were quite expensive."
1637,2686,This is a small airport with limited facilities. All arrivals have to walk from 'plane to terminal (and vice versa) - fine if it is nice and dry! Baggage claim too k a while but that's mainly because we were off the 'plane and in the terminal within minutes. The departure area was a bit crowded but light and airy with nice views out over the apron and runway. Good bus service to/from St. Peter Port
1638,2687,"Small airport, easy to navigate. Facilities a bit sparse, reasonably priced. Car parking not to expensive. Security can be a very dragged out affair. Quiet terminal policy, so calls are limited to boarding of planes. Overall very clean."
1639,2693,"A great little airport marred only by the indifference of the health, immigration, and customs officials. Tips to make the gauntlet of officialdom go less awful: - The Honduran government says that there are no COVID-related entry restrictions or controls. This is a lie. Have your proof of vaccination ready to show upon arrival. - The Honduran government says that travelers must register online with immigration in advance, but the online system doesn't work so don't waste your time. Simply present yourself to immigration upon arrival. - The Honduran government says that travelers must register online with customs in advance using a separate system, but that system doesn't work either. Ask your airline to provide a paper form for you to present upon arrival."
1640,2694,"The airport is well organized, clean, efficient, and pleasant. The only sour note was the dysfunctional online immigration system: not only was it not working, but none of the many immigration officials could be bothered to even acknowledge the problem, much less provide any assistance. It was an airport employee who intervened on our behalf and get us through the gauntlet on time for our flight. Five stars to the airport, and zero stars to the immigration officials."
1641,2695,"The airport itself is great: clean, attractive, well laid out, and with services even available to arriving passengers. Immigration and customs are frustratingly slow however, and it is a cruel slap in the face to exit customs and be immediately accosted by shouting taxi touts. XPL was great when it first opened and I'm sad to see that the ills of TGU have infected it."
1642,2698,"It's very convenient to the airport by the Airport Link, Taxi, Bus. The services were fast and the crews are polite. There's a playground for children. It's great! However, the free wifi is quite slow but it's ok. Not bothering the overall 5-stars rating."
1643,2700,I liked mostly the lounge because it had WiFi but I got a bit car sick on the way to the airport the food was very good
1644,2701,"Good airport, very efficient. I got my luggage checked in at airport express. Visited a few lounges. good quality."
1645,2702,"Hong Kong Airport was efficient as usual, all process inside the airport was very smooth as expected except for a little bit delay for the baggage claim. The only negative was the airport bus schedule, it was scheduled at an unacceptable 1-hour interval."
1646,2703,Checked in at Hong Kong's down town check in facility and rode on the Airport Express train to the airport. What a superb set up!
1647,2704,Huge airport with lots of food and retail options. Very spacious with lots of seating and washrooms. Gates are spaced far apart so prepare for walking. The sky bridge is cool so check it out.
1648,2705,Be sure to purchase food/drinks before security check as there is only a small amount of restaurants in the departure area that mainly cater to locals.
1649,2706,"I have wait the baggage at the baggage claim for almost 1 hour. At first, there has a few bags out and then the belt stop. We wait a long time for the bag"
1650,2707,"Fast and high efficiency, I just used five minutes to check in and also five minutes for imigration, the boarding process was really fast and it just cost you a few second because it just only need to scan your face"
1651,2708,"Would be a good airport, but it is a joke that only 2 bus goes there and thats it for public transport… otherwise you can take a scam taxi or a shuttle."
1652,2709,big airport so here goes nothing ther were a lot of shops and places to go to the water was nice toilet great it was fun because it doesnt matter that it was boring to walk there 4 hours.
1653,2710,"There were 3 flights landing within a short period of time and the queues for immigration were very long. eventually, I noticed a desk for UK passengers which speeded up at the end. The baggage took a long time to arrive."
1654,2711,"Its not a busy airport, but a big one. I mean by this there are no huge crowds in shops. Its really chill and calm."
1655,2712,And it’s an OK airport They don’t really have much when it comes to food. It’s very small and it’s hot during the day. Other than that it’s fine.
1656,2713,"The airport can be reached only by bus if you wanna use public transportation. Check-in is easy, there are many self service kiosk and bag drops. Security normally within 10 minutes. During peak hours the terminal is very crowded, hard to find seats to sit down a bit or eat"
1657,2714,Pretty cool airport. Check in and security was probably about 5 minutes! Food could of been more interesting. The Memories of Hungary seems like a cool store to have in an airport.
1658,2715,"Very fast arrival and fast passport control. Not many questions on arrival, just stamp and go. Upon arrival there is a Spar to buy some food or drink."
1659,2718,"Small airport with minimum services. When we arrived the check in hall was without light, which is not really good if you arriving to the terminal."
1660,2719,"Small airport, there is only one bus line with few departure to the airport Taxi is cheap and best price value airport transfer. Choose Bolt application for taxi :) Check in / boarding staff is easygoing. They arrived to the departure gate after the pax from the arriving plane has landed."
1661,2728,I came to this airport frequently 2-3 times a year. I never got problems or missed anything. staff is professional and friendly all the times. I got a lot of package and also my bike. not any problem over all the years and I enjoy my flight and arrival in sarmellek/heviz all the times...
1662,2735,"A small airport terminal, but with a café (and decent car rentals). Good view of runway and stands. Icelandic aviation museum right next door."
1663,2736,"Although the airport is easy to notice, getting to it it's not so easy in winter. During day it's even possible to walk on foot, but in winter using taxi seems mandatory. No security check before departure. Staff very kind and fast. You can eat or drink something in one place."
1664,2737,"Excellent city, has electricity. Excellent city, has electricity. Excellent city, has electricity. Excellent city, has electricity. Excellent city, has electricity.

1665,2741,"Very Calm Airport, anytime of the day even early it’s a great and calm airport. One Of the best Airports in Europe."
1666,2742,"All of the businesses there were very clean, and the facilities were nice and clean. The staff were very helpful and kind and overall a nice airport to visit."
1667,2743,"Most things were shut down while I was here however, everything that was open was very nice. Thr facilities were clean and the services were amazing."
1668,2744,"The saga lounge was amazing great food, however when we were waiting to board all the passengers included me were stood in a small room for 30 mins waiting for a bus to get us, that made me give it a 4 instead of a 5."
1669,2745,Keflavik airport is cool big airport. Very cool design so recommending to visit the airport! Very cool for plane spotting too!
1670,2746,"Flight Riga to Keflavik was very smooth terminal was good for a walk and I did not use WiFi. I did not eat, I did not visit the lounge and Immigration/coustoms service was good and baggage claim was very good."
1671,2747,"A good airport if you're an arrival and Iceland is your final destination. Woe-betide-you however if you are connecting flights. You can obviously tell that the airport was built before the tourism boom. The international terminal is cramped, causing everyone to have to squeeze by interfering with lines for gates. Speaking of lines, they are chaotic, and no-one tells you where to stand. Security is inefficient. Customs however is streamlined and smooth. Final verdict: a good airport for travel to Iceland, avoid connections here though."
1672,2748,"nice small airport, good place to get a lot of stuff before you head back (in my case to the uk) and was pleasent to go out of"
1673,2749,The airport quite far from Reykjavik but because of FlyBus it is not a problem. I wasn't in the pre-security area too long because after getting a bus I headed immidiately into security and then to my gate and the stay was nice.
1674,2751,"Quite small domestic airport, but very friendly. No security check before departure. Wi-fi works perfectly. A few places to eat and drink."
1675,2752,"Excellent city, has electricity. Excellent city, has electricity. Excellent city, has electricity. Excellent city, has electricity. Excellent city, has electricity.

1676,2753,"Airport is okay can get crowded when alot of people are at the airport, there is a snack shop that is a little expensive but okay, lounge is really bad old torn and disgusting seats. This airport is okay will get the job done. if flying domestic flights to Akureyri or Egilsstadir this is your only choice! Airport rating 3/5"
1677,2754,"Older facility, small in town domestic airport. Short drive from downtown, easy access and egress. Functional, nothing fancy. No jetways. New stand, snack quickie mart just off of flight gate area. Works quite well for what it is."
1678,2756,"NO SECURITY SHIT!!! Actually, no security at all! Just show your ticket and walk right on the plane. Amazing country, amazing airport, amazing people, amazing everything :)"
1679,2757,Ok airport
1680,2759,nice airport
1681,2761,Make sure you reach at the airport one for earlier. Flight from this airport to Kolkata is very busy and full. Doesn't really care. Airport is pretty small and less amenities are available.
1682,2762,The facilities seemed adequate for a domestic airport. Security checks were long. There are auto rickshaws available to and from the airport.
1683,2763,Singerbhil or Agartala Airport is a micro airport located in the city of Agartala . The airport itself shares boundary with Bangladesh. Compared to other main stream airports in the country this airport is very much lagging behind with old school services and facilities. But a new International Airport all together is coming up soon which might scale up the operations as well.
1684,2764,I went to this airport yesterday and i found its awesome cool airport.I am Saumyajeet Bhattacharjee from Silchar.But yes it needs to be updated now.There is no problem with this airport in terms of its facilities and all other things.So far so good.
1685,2766,The Ahmedabad Airport is really good with kind staff. Also good transport and connectivity services. Lot of food options are available. Also good Lounges.
1686,2767,"Due to the server being down in Chennai, I have to manually check in the luggage in Ahmedabad again"
1687,2768,One of the best airports in Gujarat region. The size of it is also quite huge and impressive. The staff is also polite and helpful. Access to the airport is good too.
1688,2769,"I've flown into and out of AMD quite a bit of times. It's not a gigantic airport, but it does the job well. Security for me hasn't taken longer than 10 minutes ever. Domestic departures doesn't have many shops but there are some restaurants and other shops"
1689,2772,there is no need of security check for connecting passengers as they already have had their checks in the previous airport. i almost missed my flight because of the security check. i had a layover time of 30 min and it took 40 min for security check. the airline was co operative to let us in else we would have missed over flight
1690,2773,"Fairly large airport, serves all corners of India. Cab/auto menace outside is a turnoff. Airport is easily reachable."
1691,2775,"Great airport of Ahmedabad,Outpasses Go a Intl Airport In terms of looks and other aspects. Good facilities but still lacks as compared to CSIA,KIAL,IGIA"
1692,2779,"No Air India Lounge available in Terminal, no AC in Terminal. In general ok, but the little extras are missing."
1693,2780,"A really good airport, but not much shops in duty free but there is a cloths shop which sells Kashmir shols."
1694,2781,arrival hall is rubbish..
1695,2785,Bangalore airport is one of the fastest growing airports in the world which transited 33.30 million passengers in 2018-19. From Departure gates to security check it takes about 14 to 25 minutes. official website: www.bengaluruairport.com
1696,2786,Bangalore airport is one of the fastest growing airports in the world which transited 33.30 million passengers in 2018-19. From Departure gates to security check it takes about 14 to 25 minutes. official website: www.bengaluruairport.com
1697,2787,Its Really An Awesome Airport. Especially when you compare it with tier 3 cities like vijayawada. My Check in was very fast so i just sat near my gate and was waiting. i enjoyed the wifi it was really good. There are many food courts. Transport from airport to plane was also excellent
1698,2793,Quick and easy arrival. Very impressed. Nice modern airport.
1699,2794,Wireless never worked.
1700,2795,Good airport with basic facilities. Nothing special. Very few stores and aminities. Can do better. Too far from main city
1701,2796,The new airport is nice. short distances and very fast.
1702,2800,A clean and good airport. It's relatively small from other major international airports. It has a great connectivity to various cities.
1703,2802,"The new terminal is swanky and great. The terminal building looks good, the approach is much better than the old airport with the new aerocity road via Mohali being a traffic free expressway to the terminal. Overall, the terminal has been greatly improved and has great views of air force planes and helicopters !"
1704,2808,"[Disclaimer: Newer international terminal has been opened, my review is outdated] Toilets at MAA airport are absolutely filthy. Staff are unfriendly, security checks are strict to earn as much money as possible."
1705,2809,"For the first time in Flight Travel airport server is down, waited more than 30min near to check-in counter The check-in Luggage tag is also written by hand and boarded on flight"
1706,2813,I traveled with young kids and aged parents. Hassle free process and very easy to reach airport. Complete process : Entry to Airport --->check-in-->immigration-->security check---> Reach to gate it took 45 min. Took more time at security check. rest all well organized.
1707,2814,Airport was empty in the morning. Retail outlets were open. Security was quick. Boarding was organised and started on time.
1708,2815,Large airport with all facilities now. Recently connected by metro also. Offers good lounge service airside
1709,2816,Getting luggage takes some time. Nobody checks E-pass. Strictly avoid Ola/Uber as either they wont come or will charge excess money to drop to your destination. Airport taxi services are more reliable and drivers are good mannered
1710,2817,I liked the flight very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much very much
1711,2818,"Within 5mins I completed checkin, immigration & security check.. Flew many times from COK, this airport is always special. We don’t feel tensed at all."
1712,2819,Fully solar airport steals the show really. Big waiting area & is well maintained. Lounge has great view & food.
1713,2820,Cochin Airport is very good airport. It's very beautiful . They were first airport in this world with solar power. Which crazy SJWs like Greta Thunberg can be happy with. Security was a mess people don't know basic things like how to follow a line. People were rushing and people were creating mess by going first without noticing other people. They really need some to improve their security checks. The people at the security checks were people from the Indian Army. Also in almost every airport in India have high security checks.
1714,2821,It's a good airport. Better than the airport at Toronto. It's the world's first solar powered airport in the world. Which good good for activist. The airport is one the most cleaned airport in the world.
1715,2822,"One of the best airports in Kerala. Facilities and cleanliness are top of the line. Security checking needs to be improved, it takes lot of time to complete the security procedures. Very easy to get into the airport from any part of the state, check in process is fine. Terminal facilities are sufficient for passengers. Food and retail services are less compared to other airports in India."
1716,2823,Biggest airport in Kerala catering both domestic and International passengers. T3 caters international flights whereas T1 caters domestic flights. T3 has a duty free shop. Both terminals have lounge facility and also food court. The connectivity is basically the taxi which is available 24x7. Long distance bus services are there done by ksrtc
1717,2824,Good except except where its built on a dump. Airport was shut down due to 1 day of rain causing flooding.
1718,2825,Airport is a little far from the city. Facilities are good. The security lines can be long and frustrating. They are also not so great for reasoning with. Blind laws rule the roost.
1719,2826,"At best, the domestic terminal is functional. It is small, overcrowded and does not have too many chairs to sit on. I didn't get any WiFi signal too. And the retail services were non-existent. On the flip side, the entire airport is run on solar power. SO full marks there."
1720,2827,The washroom was very clean than most of the international airports maybe because it is the smallest airport it would be easy for them to maintain it. Food courts and options were available inside. Blackberry restaurant doesn't properly support the lounge feature they just give a single meal or snack.
1721,2828,this airport has improved a lot in recent times. wash rooms have been maintained decently. food 7 retail services have improved. seamless check in process.
1722,2829,No issues. Wash rooms could have been maintained better at the arrival area. It was damn stinking and was not up to the standard of an international airport.
1723,2832,One of the cleanest airports maintained by AAI...good facilities.....is big and has separated terminal buildings for departure and arrival which is good....has all basic facilities and hi speed wifi...good restaurants outside....it sits right within the city and has a flat six lane road to connect it
1724,2833,"Coimbatore - CJB - is a typical government run (AAI) airport. The departure section of the domestic terminal was very oldish. The check-in area is quite huge, and has great signages. The waiting area was hot - AC was working in certain areas and not working in other places. Plenty of mobile charging points were available. Did not try out the food services - but the options did not look great to me. Getting to the airport is expensive - public transportation isn't very common till the airport."
1725,2835,"Airport was kept clean and it was very organised, no issues and very functional. Although small, it had small shops and other things."
1726,2837,The aiport is small hence you get out of the aiport quickly as not many flights operate in and out at the same time
1727,2838,"T2 is always overcrowded, even security personal comes out little too harsh compared to BLR or T1 staff. Above average terminal, lot of options to eat or shop, one bar is also there, along with a smoking zone. if you do not have a priority boarding option purchased, expect long queues"
1728,2843,"Better than I expected compared to photos I've seen of some of the rest of India. Immigration, baggage claim and customs very efficient."
1729,2844,"Nothing to complain about Take rickshaw, tuk-tuk, taxi, or lovely metro Metro clean, fast, cheap Bathrooms modern and clean Wifi good enough Didn't eat food or go to lounge Immigration a bit of a pain but alright otherwise Baggage claim easy and easy access to outside w/ phones"
1730,2845,"Useful trip and awesome happenings,and awesome experience,I will be going next time, because Delhi Indore connectivity better."
1731,2846,"Please make use of dedicated check-in pathways (Digi-yatra) for domestic passengers. Special security zone (Zone -5) with minimal queue can be availed by passengers traveling with infants, pregnant passengers and Digi Yatra users."
1732,2847,Very good airport. Lots of staff at immigration and security makes for short lines. Special business class lines really help too.
1733,2850,Gettng to the airport is breeze . But once inside the airport it’s very cramped . No enough chairs to sit. Boarding area has chairs but not enough to accommodate the crowd airport sees on daily basis
1734,2853,"Its nondescript. Services and shops do lack and the airport has a sterile feel to it. However, it's functionality is undeniable"
1735,2854,Security are a bit anal Vapes and ecigs are confiscated even when they cannot be used without the liquid. Other than that airport facilities are pretty much basic.
1736,2855,"Getting in to the airport was a real plain especially Gate 4 on a weekend. long queue, better to reach atleast 2 hours prior to boarding time. all others are ok."
1737,2856,"1. Getting to the airport from Calangute beach took ages and was tiring. 2. The loos are clean. Overall, the terminal is clean. 3. Lots of food services. 4. WiFi is non-existent."
1738,2857,Getting a cab out of the airport continues to be a nightmare. Even when you manage a cab the vehicle will be parked far away and you have to drag your baggage around.
1739,2861,"Located far off. Avoid late evening flights, since commuting is terrible giving. Facilities are minimal."
1740,2863,This airport now in 2017 is overflowing with its capacity. It is eventually the busiest airport in North East India and needs an overhaul. Apart from it facilities are at par. And a flight in the North East is relatively economic.
1741,2865,"One of the best airport and services experienced including lounge, lost and found. Most pleasant experience. Please great food at the lounge."
1742,2866,Termainal waiting area in the domestic section is starved for space. Need more seating and fewer shopping options.
1743,2867,"Very well maintained airport. Hyderabad international airport has best of facilities and have all basic as well luxury amenities in it. Reaching airport from city takes time as city traffic may be congested. However, going through PVNR flyover or Outer ring road makes things easier. Hyderabad airport also has lush green outer which makes pleasant while entering and leaving airport. It is advised to reach 2 Hrs before departure as there may be heavy rush during morning and evening hours."
1744,2868,"Well maintained airport from airport roads to lounges. Best in class facility. Reach 2 Hrs before flight departure to avoid last minute rush. New airport boasts world class facilities from restaurants to spas. Readings, lounges and spacious throughout. Security check may take time with unprecedented rush on weekends. They accept e-tickets."
1745,2869,"Hyderabad International Airport, also known as Rajiv Gandhi International Airport / NT Rama Rao Domestic Airport is located outside the city of Hyderabad, at a place called Shamshabad. The airport serves the population of Hyderabad. This is the second PPP airport in the country, and has been winning awards consistently. For some reason, I found the airport very congested and confusing. Departures are located at the second level, while the first level is used for arrivals - the baggage services and other ancillaries take up the ground level. One has to go up to the second level to check-in and clear security. The gates are up in the second floor - then one takes an escalator to come down to the first floor and then take the jetway to get to the aircraft. The signboards are very confusing. There are too many shops and a gate gets obscured by the shops. The dining options aren't as big as at Bengaluru, but fairly good enough. Its more of a Mall than an airport!"
1746,2870,Hyderabad has its new airport near Shamshabad named as Rajiv Gandhi Intl Airport and the new ICAO code is VOHS.RGIA has got many intl awards consequently for its cleanliness and maintenance.It is truly world class Airport.
1747,2873,"Rajiv Gandhi Airport, not Begumpet!"
1748,2874,"Not a bad airport now. However, always take full printed ticket of your flights. The ""security"" won't accept any concept of e-ticket"
1749,2875,"Useful trip and awesome happenings,and awesome experience,I will be going next time, because Delhi Indore connectivity better."
1750,2876,"This was fine experience because the airport facilities are fine and avarage so I think we will give 5 Star rating to this airport,"
1751,2877,Air conditioners don't work in aerobridges which adds to the discomfort of the passengers while boarding the aircraft.
1752,2878,There were cockroaches crawling around the food serving place in the lounge. This is a smaller Priority Pass lounge but one would expect some cleanliness standards.
1753,2879,"The wifi sucks lol. The staff used their number. Thank you so much. Among them, the Air Asia employee is a friend who is obsessed with K-drama, so we kept chatting haha."
1754,2880,"Congested terminal, small seating area, inadequate washroom space, long and separate queues for baggage screening + check-in. Lack of decent fast food options, overpriced food Thumbs up for humble security officials."
1755,2882,beware of the people watch around you don't take any help for airport staff they charge you a lot and once u enter Jaipur they throw your luggage once it enters the conveyor belt.
1756,2883,"Airport is easily reachable. There are three floors, with the ground floor for domestic flight and the second floor for international flights. Seating space is rather limited and terminal appears crowded. Very limited options for eating once you clear security (2 snack bars, 1 cafe, 1 juice shop, 4-5 shops). Not the most comfortable of terminals, but not too bad either. Quite okay if the waiting time is short."
1757,2884,Amazing services at Jaipur airport. Luggage claim in very convenient and hassle free. Also the airport staff is very humble and ready to help everytime. Very clean lounges and lots of retail shopping facilities inside the terminal.
1758,2885,"Arriving at Jaipur Airport is quite easy. You reach the baggage claiming belt, take you luggage and go outside. The cheapest way to get into the city is the Tuk Tuk counter. Therefore you leave the aiport area and proceed to the exit. Next to the exit you will find the counter. It is cheaper when you bargain with the drivers. To get into Jaipur City I will recommend about Rs. 200."
1759,2892,Kolkata NSCB airport is a very good and modern airport with fast queues at immigration and security. Checkin at international departures can be a bit of a hassle though. Other than that a good place to observe modern Indian architecture.
1760,2893,Baggage claim was very slow. Always takes over 1 hour at CCU to get 1 bag. Feels like a very slow car is getting the baggage from dubai. Not clean at all especially the domestic gates. Wifi is really bad. Cannot even run netflix or youtube without having a problem like bad video quality. The lounge is not that good. You pay so much for one person??? Just for some food and a chair??? Rather would eat from the fast food areas than go and pay so much for a chair and food.
1761,2895,The baggage reclaim area is as I would say not the best. Most of the time (international and domestic) baggage reclaim takes 30 mins to 1 hour.
1762,2896,"Calcutta cabbies are a law unto themselves. Uber is slightly better, but Ola cabbies are the worst. So, you might face a cancellation from the drivers a few times before you get a ride."
1763,2898,Lot of open space in the baggage lounge near the belts and sitting arrangement. Few shops also around. Ground staff / security was helpful in answering any query I had.
1764,2899,Always bice to be here. But restaurants get closed after 12am. So those who are to catch early morning flights suffer a bit.
1765,2901,the lounge is small and limited offerings. the duty free is also pretty limited when it comes to the range. atm facilities and wifi are also limited. some areas are even prone to cell phone reception issues. decent airport at best.
1766,2904,This was fine experience because the airport facilities are fine and avarage so I think we will give 5 Star rating to this airport
1767,2907,No free wifi for international travelers with foreign SIM cards. Need OTP on Indian number. Very limited food stalls in arrival area. Very few seating and only one mobile charger in arrival hall.
1768,2909,Good airport but rather small. There is no proper lounge and stores are limited but still a good experience.
1769,2910,The airport in Lucknow is very nice. It has good amenities and the staff is also nice. The airport is large and modern and the whole process from check-in to boarding was very smooth.
1770,2911,"Lucknow airport has to terminals out of which The older terminal is used for international operations an The newer one for domestic flights.the terminal size isn't that big and it could get crowded at times however the swift boarding and security makes the process much easier an relaxing for passengers. There are a few food courts and snack counters and a few duty free shops enough for it's size. The best part of this airport is the connectivity to the main hot spots of the city being connected to the metro trains where the Metro Station is just 60 feet away from the terminal which even bigger airports like Mumbai,hyderaad and Bangalore lack."
1771,2912,"Lucknow Airport is average airport as compared to Delhi, Mumbai or say Hyderabad. However, visiting to Lucknow is inevitable due to its rich heritage, culture and business. Being the heart and capital of Uttar Pradesh state of India it attracts more people on any working days. Food availability both veg and non-veg is very good. Travelers should take pre-paid taxi going out from Airport. It is safer. Getting to the airport, start well in advance and keep buffer time for traffic during day time. Traffic congestion due to VIP movement may not be ruled out."
1772,2915,"Mangalore International Airport, located at Bajpe in the outskirts of the city, is a small regional airport. The airport handles a few domestic flights and a few international flights (to the middle east). The terminal has been recently expanded, and hence has a modern glass facade. The terminal has a total of 4 gates - 2 with jetways, and 2 that use buses to ferry passengers. The domestic section is small - there are hardly any shopping options inside the terminal. Food services are basic - just light snacks and beverages sold. Waiting area is sufficiently big to hold just enough passengers a narrow-body aircraft can take. The runway is interesting to the avgeek. Mangalore is a table-top runway, and hence has some beautiful views when taking off."
1773,2916,"The Airport is indeed a Really wonderful one and changed a lot since 3 years !!! But, needs to introduce few more international airlines and extend the runway to atleast 11000 to deal with the Passengers east voyage !!!"
1774,2917,This airport is refreshing change from what it used to be 3 years ago
1775,2918,Small airport - nice scenery on the way.
1776,2919,One of Indias best airports. But if you are flying out from T2 you better have loads of money in your bank or cash. The cheapest cup of tea was 180/- + tax.
1777,2920,Was excellent. Airport has good facilities and the lounge too is very good. Good F&B options available at the airport.
1778,2921,"Stuck on the Apron on arrival in the cramped A21N for half an hour because some random plane took our place. Not a great experience but atleast got a decent planespotting session. Saw UR430 , SQ426 , LX154 , EY204 (35K) and others"
1779,2922,"Quite full, takes a long time for security checks and lot of delays and hovering in the air waiting for landing clearance. Has amazing food and retail services, but lacks cleanliness and is time-taking and full."
1780,2923,hi wanna say that this is the best airport in whole asia if u want to go in india u should come in mumbai
1781,2924,i live near mumbai and i was going to flight and the airport was very clean and i had went into it was very good to me and the flight had jetway glass this is the best airport in asia
1782,2927,Everything is awesome. Artwork is amazing. There are no pharmacies after check ins in the domestic checkin
1783,2928,THe flight was delayed but it was ok ok they gave T1 so it was not so beautiful airport T2 is beautiful
1784,2929,"The Sonegaon Airport is aesthetically archaic but functionally alright, considering its modest size. There are 2 aerobridges and 5 gates split between two levels. The food and retail outlets are limited and very compact in dimensions and offerings alike. The airport has an open playpen in an extended passenger seating area which also houses several lounge chairs as well. There are four baggage belts in total and the car park is at a walkable distance land-side."
1785,2932,Not a very big airport hence the minimum facilities. Hope some expansion and improvement will happen once GMR takes over. The parking and pickup drop facilities are horrible to put mildly. The fares from aggregators like Uber are so high even for a 6kms drive and on top the 100/- parking that a passenger has to shell out is like loot. Pickup and exit barely takes 5 to 7 minutes but the passenger still has to pay the parking charges. I was asked 400/- for 6kms drive.
1786,2933,"Quick and efficient checkin at the baggaage xray, and counter services. Was asked not to proceed for security check as the flight had yet to take off from Mumbai. Was located and informed by a Air India staff member when the security check started for my flight. Security check was thorough and quick and I was then in the waiting hall for boarding. Limited outlets serving snacks and tea / coffee and ice creams but ample space and chairs to sit and wait for boarding."
1787,2934,"My hometown airport. Quite basic in it's nature. Not a fan of the 90s looking interiors. I don't mind the small size, but everything just looks quite old inside the terminal. Hardly any options to eat. And the parking charge for arriving passengers' cabs is such scam! Security is a bottle neck and can take a lot of time if there are multiple flights at the same time. It's very badly managed"
1788,2935,This is perhaps the only airport where you pay parking charges for calling a cab to pick you up. Infact I paid more for Uber from Nagpur Airport to my home than I did for getting to T2 terminal Mumbai. Parking area is in shambles totally mismanaged and dirty. The rickshaw and taxi drivers are allowed right upto the terminal building to heckle you as you come out of the airport building.
1789,2937,The airport is very small and needs urgent expansion. The airport has a lot of passengers but there aren't any good amenities at all. Patna needs an new airport as soon as possible.
1790,2938,Patna airport is a very old airport and needs to be expanded/renovated as it lacks many modern facilities. More airbridges and shops should be added as well. Thankfully a new terminal is being built so that should solve the problem.
1791,2940,This is a defense airport but used for civil flights also. Immigration was smooth and helpful. Security check was faster. However lot's of crowd in festive days so start early.
1792,2941,Pune needs new Indepedent Airport. The current one is controlled by Army and Commercial fligts are not given the priority. AAI should look into this and build new Imdependent airport
1793,2943,"The airport seems to be running at or beyond capacity. But since it is a defense airport, there is not much development that can be done. So don't go there at the last minute thinking that one can get through all the process and board on time."
1794,2946,"Pune (Lohegaon) is basically a civilan enclave in an Armed Forces Airport (Under the Indian Air Force). The terminal is managed by the Airports Authority of India and is quite small for a city of the size of Pune. Its quite congested a place. Entering into the airport is through two levels of CISF checking. The security check is quite slow - more because departures happen in blocks and a lot of passengers reach the place at one time. The security hold is not very big, and has too little facilities. Very basic waiting area - with torn furniture at places. I couldn't find any charging points anywhere as well."
1795,2948,FSSX
1796,2949,"Lovely Airport, Bit of Jerk While Landing But Best Experience Ever :)"
1797,2958,"This airport is a bit busy and has limited facilities, yet service persons are god and co-operative. you should always reach before 2 hours of your flight time."
1798,2961,"A simple airport but overall it is a good airport with complete facility. Restaurant seems to be only available at the waiting hall but food are nice. A bit crowded though. Taxi service is also available, and there is also a counter to apply for ILP to sikkim."
1799,2964,"Not bad for a small domestic airport. Nothing made the experience bad. Everything was smooth. We expected high security checks since they're continuous terrorist attacks, but surprisingly nothing were there. But the airport can be upgraded and there's so much to improve."
1800,2965,"Srinagar Airport (SXR) being an air force base, has a high security cordon around it. It being in a politically sensitive area doesn't help. One should always be prepared to go through multiple security checkpoints when visiting here, especially during departure."
1801,2966,lot of security at the airport.
1802,2967,"Good city airport,small in size and tends to get congested during peak hours advised to get to the airport atleast 2hrs prior departures if you have check in baggages.Also cab service are difficult to avail during peak hours bus city bus(BRTS buses) are available plying between Airport and railway station."

1805,2972,The Airport itself is very close to the City - 3 km from sity Centre as the crow flies and 6 Km to the Domestic airport. It is also conencted by very good road with GPS controlled Traffic signals so that you reach quickly. It took just 10 minutes for me to get my baggage and come out. Excellent
1806,2973,"Trivandrum Airport always had a cool efficiency. The layout and the access are all normal facilitites without any glitz or glamour, but it helps smooth flow of passengers"
1807,2974,I have not used the International Terminal so cant comment on that. But the domestic terminal really needs to be upadated according to times. Its still the old building built decades ago. The facilities are also less compared to other airports. The only plus point would be the accesibility of the airport since its very near to other transport services like bus and train
1808,2975,Best airport handled well by Airport Authority of INDIA...being on the NH66 bypass side it is very easily accessible at any time.
1809,2976,"It's India, relatively direct highway to airport but constantly weaving around/dodging on-coming truck, cars, motorcycles, animals. Check-in and security line short and quick. Terminal, food, and lounge a disappointment. Flies in the lounge, food unedible. Better to sit near boarding gate and have a beer."
1810,2977,"Arrival in TVM without issues, relatively new/modern airport, clean, amazingly short line in immigration. Long wait for baggage."
1811,2978,"It's my home airport. Based on the prevailing conditions, it is a very good airport lying on the shore of Arabian see. Everything is available here, but needs further development as even though it became an international airport long back, it is yet to get that international standards in all levels. Easy to get to the airport and it will get more easier as the roads to the airport are going to be widened shortly. Close to the IT park. It can be used as the regional hub to the southern most tip of India."
1812,2980,"The New Terminal is the best in Kerala. It takes very less time to reach airport and check in. Well connected by Road. Railway Station just 4 km away. More airlines should start services from the city. It is the Indian International Airport located very near Colombo,Singapore,Malaysia,Indinesia,Australia and Maldives,so more services should be planned to these destination in addition to the Gulf Sector."
1813,2981,GOOD AIRPORT located at the heart of the city centre
1814,2989,One of best regional to international converted airports of India and maintained very well by the authorities.
1815,2990,The airport is in good condition but lack some basics like no announcement about the flight arrival/delay and most of the time departure/arrival displays are not working are not available at the gates.
1816,2991,The airport was quickly restored after the extensive damage of hud hud cyclone but yet still some facilities should be added like the immigration procedure took a lot of time and wifi was not available rest all good
1817,2992,"In spite of the excessive damage caused by recent severe cyclone Hudhud, Vizag Airport officials are doing their best to bring it back to normalcy. Certain facilities are not available because of the damage caused. overall its good."
1818,2993,"Although the air terminal was almost destroyed by the typhoon of 10th October 2014, basic functionality is totally restored. Very good is related to the capacity to offer acceptable services in such conditions."
1819,2996,"Best airport in Borneo (Kalimantan) overall. Many lounge facilities that you can use it free like movie theatre, charging station, photogenic spots, and you can also planespotting easily here."
1820,2997,"Balikpapan is one of the best airport for me because i've been to balikpapan many times, its basically my home and.... I've been seeing the changes of this airport, its developing super fast and awesome"
1821,2998,Best airport in east Borneo. Family friendly airport. Helpful staff. Fast boarding and security fast.
1822,2999,Brand New Terminal of Sepinggan more Efficient and Attractive with Hi-tech Technology (BHS aka Baggage Handling System) and AODB.Nice Counter Check In and Waiting Room.Adopted from Eco Airport System Sepinggan International supported Eco Green Airport System in Indonesia and the First in Indonesia Mini Jungle in Baggage Claim Area
1823,3000,"One of the best, most luxurious and most sophisticated airports in Indonesia. Airport with the only Mall in Indonesia. If you like traveling and are traveling, you must stop for a moment in Balikpapan. This airport has glass throughout the room which ensures sunlight enters the room thereby saving up to 90% of electricity."

1825,3002,"Nice airport with professional ground crew. available daily transport call ''DAMRI'' to Mesjid Raya Baiturrahman for free. you can taste the ule kareeng coffee on Check Yukee nearby airport parking lot. If you hungry, Do not spent your money at airpot market. LOL You can eat ""ayam tangkap"" or ""gulai kambing"" nearby. waving gallery need to be improving. especially for plan spotter's :) If available why to be worried (kalo ada mana ada) LOL"
1826,3003,"A very nice airport, with religious architecture, in accordance with the religious nuances of the area. Likewise, the facilities, cleanliness and service provided are very satisfying. good luck every time"
1827,3004,Awesome Airport
1828,3005,Airport was ok. Queue for security check was messy. Could be better. Toilets were dirty and there weren’t many retail and F&B outlets.
1829,3010,"One of the trickiest airport for pilots to land, so expect a little bit hard landing. The departure gate is pretty good. But the arrival gate only has 1 conveyor belt for baggage claiming, so sometimes it's a little bit confusing, cause every airliner use the conveyor belt at once."
1830,3011,"One of the most tricky for pilot to land, prepare yourself for maybe half hour holding going round in the sky. Really bad baggage claim area, good departure waiting area, you need to walk to the plane rain or sun."
1831,3012,Baggage claim is crowded with lots of people yelling. But this is far far better from previous terminal. Our new terminal is GOOD
1832,3013,New terminal for this airport. A much much better than the old ones. Everything is very good with this little but artistic new terminal
1833,3014,"Average airport, but too small for the fast-growing passenger numbers (especially the check-in area and the baggage reclaim area). The waiting rooms are sufficient and provide a nice overview on the runway. The food outlets opposite the terminal building are nice."
1834,3015,"First time feeling departure at this new airport terminal.Very spacious, clean, fresh, and far more comfortable than the old terminal."
1835,3016,"First time feeling arrival at the airport's new terminal after a few days of opening. Clean, cool and comfortable. The arrival gate location is quite far towards the baggage claim."
1836,3019,"I usually travelling from Jakarta to Banjarmasin due to work. Getting to Syamsudin Noor Airport is easy. Road to the airport is not crowded. But the parking area is very crowded and often full. WiFi is so so, if u don't wanna say it poor. It has several places to eat in the airport. Only one lounge, Blue Sky. I think the airport should be upgraded to a bigger one since it fells very small because of overcrowded passengers."
1837,3022,"The security check at Bali is messy and confusing. The lounge used by Singapore Airlines is just not good - there were cockroaches crawling out between the seats and the air conditioning is weak. Definitely, this needs an upgrade!"
1838,3024,"Arriving in DPS is a long and expensive process. Once clear, the route to landside snakes past numerous kiosks offering local SIM card, tourist trips, transportation services and the like. Then arriving passengers are confronted with a throng of taxi and pseudo-taxi drivers. I had an early onward journey the following morning and was staying within walking distance of the airport."
1839,3025,I arrived at terminal 2 after a late arrival and facility’s were just ok. Descent food and shopping but overall could of been better.
1840,3026,"Immigration and customs were very welcoming and helpful on arrival, and I appreciated the assistance offered proactively by the customs staff in getting my new phone registered. For once, bags actually arrived on the correct belt. It feels like the airport needs to decide what it wants to do about onward transport -- insist that only overpriced authorised taxis are allowed, or let the place be overrun by transport touts who attach themselves like limpets to arriving passengers? At the moment it's both of these. There is a perfectly good and cheap local bus to the city that runs frequently during the daytime, but it's hardly advertised and doesn't accept cash payments. There doesn't seem to be anywhere at the airport to buy a payment card that can be used on the bus."
1841,3027,"Decently close to main parts of Denpasar by car. Terminal facilities and retail/food options were pretty nice. Check however took long and the wifi did not work at all, very frustrating."
1842,3028,"Decently close to main parts of Denpasar by car. Terminal facilities and retail/food options were pretty nice. Baggage claim however took long and the wifi did not work at all, very frustrating."
1843,3029,"I've come to that check-in in Asia is slow. DPS domestic terminal is no different. The security area is small, but there was no queue and clearing security did not take long. There are plenty of shops and food options, but I couldn't find a water bottle refill area."
1844,3030,"Great restaurants in departure area with affordable price. On the other hand, few or no public transport to the airport. A taxi to Ubud is 400k-500k Rp, and takes over 1.5 hour, through the small street clogged with traffic."
1845,3036,"When I visited Halim Perdanakusuma Airport on 25/12/19 it was in the process of renovation, resulting in the airport feeling smaller and narrower. Facilities such as toilets and internet are very good. Loading baggage at Baggage Claim takes a while, so it takes a while."
1846,3037,"Security Gate too crowded,i miss my boarding time because of that,line up at the gate is too long so i need to run to catched up my plane"
1847,3038,when i arrived at this airport the baggage claim is very crowded and only one baggage claim is working. the restroom is also very small.
1848,3040,"I found a rat at bluesky lounge gate 13 terminal 3, its very disapointing for me…………………………………………………"
1849,3041,"Terminal 3 was very nice if not long. Weird lines, no relationship to length. Had to cut to get anything done, no personal space. Lost 5 bucks on the visa currency exchange"
1850,3042,"very nice airport, but traffic make it hard to reach. surprisingly baggage claim is very fast. food not bad"
1851,3043,Nice airport but terminal 1 and 2 are pretty bad. Terminal three is a dream though but I took T2 on the F wing. Very easy to go through security
1852,3044,"Arrival T3 is very hot, especially in the Baggage Claim area. Toilet gate 20s (26 - 28) in the arrival area was very dirty, in the toilet I entered there were lots of tissues strewn about and there was no janitor there. You have to think about access to baggage claim from the arrival point after boarding the bus, because it's still quite a long journey."
1853,3045,"KFC Terminal 3 gate 1* at 12pm doesn't fry chicken anymore, only gives leftover chicken and if other orders can't be made (e.g. burgers/spaghetti/potatoes).. different from A&W which is ready to make menus that customers want to order."
1854,3046,"Baggage claim took quite a long while, but immigration was thankfully fast without much line-up (either for Indonesians or foreigners). Traffic was .... Bad too. Classic Jakarta"
1855,3047,Prepare some time to get to the Airport if you're on public transport (via Airport train + APM or buses)
1856,3048,"Airport difficult to reach and takes long. Check in and security for domestic is very quick. Domestic departure area has a beautiful design, though it is a bit older, meaning its facilities are somewhat run down and there aren't many food options."
1857,3049,"Airport is far away from city centre and the traffic is very bad. Wifi was hard to access and weak, baggage claim & immigration were pretty fast. Good food spots."
1858,3056,"Airport is at the perfect location, less than 10 minutes from the city centre by car. Wifi is very slow, just like the security check. Facilities and retail options are decent considering the size of the airport."
1859,3057,"Airport is at the perfect location, less than 10 minutes from the city centre by car. Wifi is very slow, just like the baggage claim. Facilities and retail options are decent considering the size of the airport."
1860,3058,"Remote airport ""at the end of the known universe"" ;-) Terminal is new and seems to be oversized for current traffic. Nice and polite (as everywhere in Indonesia) people at check-in and security control. No complains, except for poor choice of food and souvenirs (only one small shop was open)"
1861,3062,"I finally arrive to the gateway to my final destination, starting the main part (26 days), oh yeah my mother and i went to the bathroom and its awesome so if you want to take a pee, this is the place for you indonesians"
1862,3063,"Security control on international flights have only 1 machine for all passengers, and after immigration control have only a coffee store. In opposite, national flights have more shoppings and services. Try to do better on that"
1863,3064,"Very easy airport to get out of and to enter, straight forward and simple. Check in took a while but that was on the airline not the airport."
1864,3065,"Review in Aviation Language on January 31 2021. When entering the terminal building there is a Covid-free letter validation post. There are 4 post desks, but usually only 2 officers are occupied, there is no queue, validation takes less than a minute. Entering the check-in area, there is work on expanding the east side of the terminal, which has the effect of narrowing the check-in area for Lion Group (Lion, Wings, Batik) and AirAsia. Many of the ceilings are dull and have holes in the entire terminal. Many tenants have closed due to the pandemic"
1865,3066,"A luxurious airport with the latest facilities, but lacks maintenance in the terminal, and seems less sterile from less interested visitors. plus maintenance of vehicle parking areas that are not clean and disorganized, road markings/directions are incomplete. However, Lombok is a very beautiful island, compared to Bali, Lombok's natural attractions are much more complete."
1866,3068,"1st time in Lombok Praya Airport. Overall good experience on arrival - quick baggage receipt, generally clean, personnel was also OK. But still personnel looks not very well organized for International airport."
1867,3069,"Nice new airport, spacious and clean. The airport is in southern Lombok, not far from Kuta-Lombok. There are buses (Damri) to the main city of Mataram. These are pretty quick as all roads between the airport and the city are new."
1868,3070,"This is the new airport of Lombok. Totally far away from tourist spot, e.g. senggigi and mataram. but there's public bus operated by damri (state owned company). LOP airport to senggigi fare is IDR 30.000, whereas LOP airport to Mataram city fare is Rp 20.000. Senggigi can be reach at about 1.5-2 hrs, depend on traffic"
1869,3071,"A new, clean airport with all needed facilities, though every service is fully Indonesia-style flavoured. Not that bad business lounge with Wi-Fi for only IDR 40 per person."
1870,3078,"WiFi does not reach all areas in the boarding lounge. There are also very limited seats that have charging facilities at gate 1, but there are too many at gates 2 and 3. There needs to be an even distribution."
1871,3079,"The arrival area has very poor signal, WiFi also doesn't reach Arrival. As a result, it is difficult to order a taxi online. The trunk is also a little slower."
1872,3080,"The signal at this airport is quite bad. The toilet is not very clean, fortunately it doesn't smell bad. There are very few F&B retail options here, not even KFC class. There is not much access to transportation from the airport to Manado city, if you want it cheap, take Grab, but there are very few drivers (I waited 30 minutes to get a driver). WiFi is only available in some areas, not in the waiting room and arrival area."
1873,3081,"Its a small regional aerodome in Manado, North Celebes. This Airport is Unik either the facilities and the approach. this airport had the similiar approach like the Kai Tak Hongkong airport. Its challenging. Be sure to pay attetion on approah when your coming to Manado."
1874,3082,"Nice Airport. Many choices of international flights. The restaurant sells typical Maanado food, such as yellow rice, Kampung Kodo. There is an airbrige and fast immigration checks and a strong WiFi network for planes. Back track. You can still go online."
1875,3083,"BANDARA YANG BAGUS YANG MENUNJUKAN KULTUR BUDAYA ,PENERBANGAN PAGI BAGUS WALAUPUN TERLIHAT KECIL BANDARA INI MEMPUNYAI AEROBRIGE DAN ADA PENERBANGAN INTERNASIONAL , Tempat MAKAN YANG MENYAJIKAN MAKANAN TRADITIONAL YANG ENAK RUANGAN CHECK IN CUKUP LEBAR"
1876,3084,Wasn't very familoar wirh the airport but its lovely because thw airport design itself was breath taking
1877,3085,"This airport is good enough for me, but can be better to chase singapore, the clean, and the concept of the airport is so good"
1878,3086,"Excellent RailLink connection to the city the only of its kind in Indonesia (roughly every hour, 35-50 minutes, Rp 100,000).Pretty good terminal facilities for a local airport. Good flight connections."
1879,3087,"The airport is spacious and has some facilities for an international airport such as restaurants, shops and coffee shops. However, it should be noted that there are near to nothing on the international airside area of this airport. The only thing that I do not like from this airport is the queue management of the security check on the check in area leading to the airside. Based on my experience, there are lots of passengers cutting the line and the staff seemed to be overwhelmed"
1880,3096,"Oh my god... What do I call it except, this airport is a really clean airport, and unfortunately the wifi only lasts 29 M and then an error. Oh, I'm glad I'm here. Please ask on the internet (Google, MSN, Yahoo search!) and keywords for tourism in Pekanbaru. I'm Vivi, Goodbye!"
1881,3097,"This airport is so great! the best international airport i've ever seen, it's very clean, tidy, and other things even though there are many flights and passangers, but it's still tidy and clean, really cool!"
1882,3098,"The airport is now international, nice and big. So it doesn't feel cramped anymore"
1883,3099,"Very nice, modern and clean airport. The best regional airport in Indonesia I have seen until now. The airport is only a 10 minute drive from the city centre."
1884,3100,"Supadio Airport Is the biggest airport in west kalimantan Indonesia, Supadio the airport of Pontianak,the terminal is very clean,neat,fragrant aroma,and the appropriate temperature,now Supadio airport can accommodate aircraft A320,737NG series , and now Supadio airport has the New projects of the terminal,runway,and others."
1885,3101,"Supadio Airport Is The International Airport Of Pontianak,West Borneo,INDONESIA And Now Supadio Has A New Terminal,This New Terminal Has Operation At June 2015,This Terminal Is Big And Good Facilities."
1886,3102,"It just have one check-in counter open for Garuda economy class, to crowded when check-in. If you want to use WiFi, I suggest go to Gapura Lounge, because it protected by password and more fast connection and it's free for the Sky Team Elite member."
1887,3105,"The airport is fairly new but the time I went there it was very hot, im not sure if there is WiFi but the food was ok and the lounges were also ok, immigration is ok aswell and baggage claim is small."
1888,3106,"New airport with super complete facilities, at the entrance to the airport terminal there are lots of places to take photos. Facilities such as internet are quite satisfactory. The check-in area is very spacious, but unfortunately the airport is a little quiet."
1889,3108,"A nice, clean, comfortable but small airport. I think it needs to be larger, because the passenger increase day by day. The toilet is okay, the shop also. Ehmm, i'm not there in the busy hour, but i think it will be so crowded Overall i like this airport and also the semarang city"
1890,3109,Small but comfortable. They had nursing room. No aerobridge so it's heaven for aircraft photo geeks
1891,3113,Well juanda airport seem diffirent than the last time i visit need some repairing and renovation maybe
1892,3114,COVID-19 travel documents’ verification process needs quite a huge leap in terms of speed and seamlessness
1893,3116,"Well, there were no counter dedicated to the flight at checkin at 5:50 (1 hours 40 minutes before the flight), there were no information desk, and no one can tell where to drop the bag. Then I asked an employee on a closed counter for a reference, and she asked for my passport and started to check me in (surprisingly). Insisting that I must pay for checked baggage, although I pre-booked it online. She told ""ah, yes, I see"", and continued with ""so, please pay 364,000 rupiahs"". It took a lot to check in, actually)"
1894,3117,"Quite capable for an international class airport in Indonesia. However, when I felt it yesterday, the water went dead in the afternoon. How sad."
1895,3118,Please add boarding call sound to the lounge so that it can be heard by passengers.... At that time I was called for boarding when I had the final call because there was no boarding announcement
1896,3119,I used the terminal 1. I would say bring your own food. Do not expect good waiting area. Please be careful about exorbitant food prices and drinks.
1897,3120,"Good old style airport, but the arrival hall of Citilink was little bit dark even it was 7 am. The toilet was not really clean"
1898,3123,"The airport is clean and adopts the atmosphere of Javanese culture. Getting to the airport is quite easy because there is toll access which is directly connected to the Trans Java Toll Road, and there are also buses to the city. Unfortunately, there is an airport train service to the Solo City and Klaten but the number of trips is very small."
1899,3124,"For those who travel using Adisumarmo Airport, becareful there's LRT construction work in progress."
1900,3125,the lounge is very comfortable. you can looking the aircfart taxiing to the gate and taxing to runway
1901,3128,"It is really small airport b'cuz the city is also a small city. But i liked it, it was very cute and made my mind comfortable. But, b'cus it's small, took times somewhat long, like baggage claim things."
1902,3132,"Of course the airport is small, crowded, and not air-conditioned, but it has everything you need right there, and I've never met friendlier staff. When I didn't have enough cash for the visa fee, one of the workers told them to go ahead and give me the visa, and he would go with me to the atm after and bring the money back, and he was patient and helpful even when my card didn't work until the fifth atm I tried, and then he took the time to give me (good!) directions to the bus and explain how the buses work in Yogya. The airport is right in the city, so you can just hop on a city bus from right in front of the airport."
1903,3134,Very small airport. Nice staff and a few nice restaurants out there. Be prepared to pay a tax before leaving the airport though.
1904,3136,This is certainly one of the world's best airport. It has great decorations and facilities. Lounge-like seating is provided with free computers for your convenience. The airport is even comparable to legacy airports such as Singapore Changi. You can easily spend 10 hours here
1905,3140,"The airport itself is very good, modern architecture with some local/traditional touch, but unfortunately from airport to Yogyakarta city (or vice versa) is far away. The transportation selection from/to the airport is shuttle bus or online taxi service. if you choose using airport train, the you need to take shuttle to the nearest station."
1906,3149,"I liked the CIP Terminal, the CIP entrance is included with the business class ticket which only costs 35 euros"
1907,3150,Great Airport with nice terminal. Metro is near by exit. The road is in construction and some Subsidiary is in use.
1908,3153,"A good city with nice weather in spring, with nice airport with ideal equipment"
1909,3155,sari international airport(Dasht-e Naz) is beautiful airport in north of Iran. i had travel from this airport to Kish Island airport. I see very nice view when Airplan started to take off and in sky.
1910,3156,Sari international Airport is one of the greatest airport in iran and biggest airport in north of iran with very good Taxi facility for transport to get in the airport or coming back from it. very friendly Immigration and customs personel.
1911,3157,"Sari Dasht e Naz International Airport (IATA:SRY-ICAO:OINZ) is So Nice Airport , Fast Check in, No delays and very nice runway view. I enjoyed My travel with IranAir Airbus A300-600 and Very good Traditional Restaurant"
1912,3158,The security’s behavior is not respectful and they always have problem with your hijab. The Check in is a bit slow but it’s good. It doesn’t have wi-fi (p.s. : maybe the international part has wi-fi but the domestic part doesn’t have it. The airport foods are so expensive. But all of them are not the things to make this a bad airport. I enjoy it.
1913,3159,"I love Shiraz, Hate its airport. One the best people of the world are inside Shiraz, god bless this city with its poet and wine."
1914,3160,"This airport was a very pleasant surprise for me. I used the metro to get there, it was fast and cheap (there's like 500 meters left to walk from the nearest metro station). The terminal seemed brand new and everything was so clean. The staff were the nicest. The only downside is that there was just a small snack shop in the transit area, nothing else."
1915,3162,"Fresh, new, amazingly modern for Iran. No problems with half-night stay (if you present your ticket), 24/7. Very good experience"
1916,3164,Good Airport with all you need.Good shops with good prices and a small but good terminal. But the Airport doesn't have any tax-free shop. Good Connections to the World. With Iran Air and Turkish Airlines departures you can reach the whole World!
1917,3167,"The airport was good, very clean and it was big and spacious. The airport smelled good and it was very warm."
1918,3168,The baggage wasn't delivered To Tehran's Flight from Istanbul. We were lied that the baggage was in Istanbul but it seemed it was in Toronto (where I came from).
1919,3169,"a great airport, only problem is that it is to far away from the city, and there are 2 security check, but honestly really better than most European airport"
1920,3171,"My only complaint goes towards the first security check, that is located in front of the check-in area. You have to empty your pockets and put everything in a plastic bin, that goes through the X ray (standard procedure). However, behind the X ray, all the things fall straight onto the ground! So there's a pretty good chance that your phone will get smashed or that you will loose something. Otherwise, the airport is fairly modern and spacious, there's plenty of places to eat or have a coffee, wi-fi works well and all the staff is very helpful."
1921,3172,Very hard to get to this airport because it is very far from city. There is metro but trains go only a few times per day. By taxi is expensive. Crowds in any time.
1922,3174,"Too far from city , Defective airport design and lack of quality for internationalization , You must move from your home for at least 4 hours before the flight"
1923,3175,"I think for a country like Iran, which is a beautiful and four-season country with great nature, history and different races in it, Imam Khomeini Airport is not good and enough for it. But in case our flight the process was fast which the time to enter the arrival lounge, checking Passports and receiving our baggage took only 30 minutes."
1924,3177,"Getting to the airport is a bit hard beacuse it’s a big and the capital’s airport and i’m not used to big airports. Everything’s good except the baggage claim. It’s awwwful !! Like they really don’t care for your time, the baggages come sooo late you have to wait a lot of time."
1925,3178,"Our flight had 3 hours delay due to weather condition in the destination airport. The terminal facilities for suck a long time was awful. No entertainment, no good shopping stores, and no good WiFi. Also the number of gates is not enough for suck a crowded airport and we were waiting for about 45 minutes because there wasn't an empty gate...!"
1926,3179,"A nostalgic and very busy airport in Tehran , For check in you Should refer to the airport at least 2 hours before flight."
1927,3180,"Looks like a soviet-style train station from seventies (T4), but efficient and working airport. Connection to city by taxi. It seems to be very close to Azadi Sq., and within a leisure 15 minute walk, but this is mistake, walking there could turn to be hell. Services are limited, but seems to be enough. Security was fast. Everybody is bussed to planes."
1928,3181,I Love this Airport . We Went There For Our Sightseeing Flight By Boeing 747-SP Of Iran Air . Everyone Was Excited . All Airport Staff were so Friendly and Kind to us . Unfortunately Wifi is not working . I Love Coffee shops In Terminal 2 And Specially Their View to the Runway
1929,3182,it is an oldest airport in IRAN
1930,3191,"Hello first airport and has a good clean and a vast area of the place where the large number of takeoffs and landings open 0.24 an hour and has a reputation among Arab airports ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hello first airport and has a good clean and a vast area of the place where the large number of takeoffs and landings open 0.24 an hour and has a reputation among Arab airports"
1931,3192,love this airport
1932,3195,Descent. Taxi looked like a scam. it was very hard and long to get to the airport.easy check in though. Comfortable but crowded terminals and lounges. 15 mins delay no reason OR notification that the flight was delayed. maybe not in Screens either. overall 6/10
1933,3196,Excellent and comfortable airport. We hope to increase flights. Good luck to everyone------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------- ----------------------
1934,3198,"nice.big, modern and clean airport. got to customs in 5 mins taxi was also available. overall descent"
1935,3199,Not a lot going on at the airport as usual. Check in time was very quick as this was only the second passenger flight for emirates since they stopped operations back in August due to regional conflicts. Customs was as usual quick and easy. Would like to see more services air side to help pass the time.
1936,3200,"Erbil is the safest and most secure in Iraq.People feel safe enough to stay out late into the morning when the coffee shops and stores open. Settled around 6.000 years ago, Erbil Citadel is one of the longest continuously inhabited sites in the world. The citadel, which rises some 30 meters above the surrounding area is a elliptical shaped town comprising of mainly traditional brick built courtyard houses some of the most important buildings include mosques, a hammam ( public baths ) and the two gates, UNESCO are now involved in helping to preserve it, and surely its only a matter of time before it becomes a world heritage site, Also During the Islamic period, Erbil was home to important Muslim poets, historians, and scholars, and later served as a cultural and administrative center in the Ottoman Empire."
1937,3202,Wow. Never expected such a modern airport in Iraq!
1938,3206,it is a very good international airport i have seen in my life and there have a lot of passenger that travel by this airport in this airpor there are a lot of experince which is the best offer to passenger
1939,3207,"Passing through security is always a doddle, never takes longer than 15 minutes. Slightly disappointed that not all the facilities were open at even from 8 in the morning, though hopefully this has changed now that covid is almost over."
1940,3208,"Cork is a small international airport. This has both pros and cons. While you get through check in and security very quickly, there is only one duty free shop, and not that many places to get food. But you do get good airside views."
1941,3209,Security at the airport arrivals was surprisingly strict. Got questioned and my luggage scanned at customs (I only had 1 small suitcase. Passport control was simple with an EU passport.
1942,3210,"Very small and therefore limited, but friendly staff and nice design. Got to take a bus in order to get into Cork but the airport itself is very modern and well signed..."
1943,3211,"Getting to Cork Airport is very easy, It is a 15 minute drive from the heart of the city and a 30 minute bus ride. Check-In is very easy and there is also machines to do so (Aer Lingus Only). I have never took over 5 minutes to pass security and you can spend ages looking at the wide range of duty free items in the loop. The one thing I dont like about Cork is it didnt have anywhere where you could get a substantial meal, But apparently a new restaraunt has been added so I am yet to find out. I found the WiFi very good and well I cant say anything about the lounge as I have never been to it.. In my opinion Easy and Simple."
1944,3212,"Never been to Cork Airport at night but the departures were really simple, just keep searching for Palma De Mallorca and FR7887 and all went well, The Loop was very helpful with food and drinks, I extremly liked being there at night as there was a plane at every gate (1-8)."
1945,3213,"As you would expect when you arrive at Cork, layers and layers of clouds making the flight very dull when you descend to the Airport, the Airport itself though was very clean, peaceful and quite, not neccesarily has some things you can take pictures of inside and next to the baggage compared to Lanzarote and Mallorca but still it was very good."
1946,3214,Exact same for Arrivals nice shops and a breeze getting baggage and getting back home with taxi/bus.
1947,3215,"Very clean, modern Airport, has the newest terminal in Ireland. Great shops and destinations and very easy to access."
1948,3216,"A Perfect Smaller Airport, isn't big but for a smaller airport it has great access to the Airport, Check-In, Security check,etc. Also nicely layed-out, there is only 8 gates but are all perfectly timed and placed with the taxiways and runways. Only 1 Main Runway 17/35, 07/25 isn't used a lot, only for smaller planes."
1949,3218,Very easy to get to the airport by bus. Security check really fast. Enough seating for everybody. Sadly just not much access to windows.
1950,3219,"Dublin was easy as per usual. Bag drop was alright, the staff kept closing check-in desks which made the process slower. Having the fast track through security was very handy."
1951,3220,Security is getting better with shorter queues but still have to separate liquids and Ipads in Terminal 1. Only one public bus service to aiport during the night and its early morning 6am-8am that most flights depart. Promised underground or rail link in pipeline for twenty years has not materialised yet
1952,3221,"Easy to get to the airport by bus. Security is really anal about liquids. All your liquids need to fit in one plastic bag. Shops are great and numerous, but if you’re in T2, there are no more shops after the central area. T1 has shops in and around gates, but T2 doesn’t."
1953,3222,"Decent small and clean with a lot of good retail places. Immigration was quick and easy. While the airport lacks a rail connection there are plenty of transportation links to Dublin, the surrounding areas and the rest of the island of Ireland."
1954,3223,"Very fast, you didn't need to take anything out of you're bag jouring security and the staff were genarlly freindly and helpful. Plus there was long ques at security and yet it only took 5 minutes ish too get through! Loved it and I arrived at the airport about 50 minutes before the plane departed and yet we still got through to the gate 10 minutes before boarding started! I will defo be going through Dublin again when I visit in around a months time!"
1955,3224,"I have to give 5 stars as this is my main airport to fly out of. 2 terminals, big enough but not a huge airport. Lots of options to fly to the U.S. but would be nice if they could be able to support more transatlantic routes to South America and Asia as well! Getting to the airport overall is bad. Only bus or taxi, no other option or a bus that gets you into the city center. Security better now but for a long time horrendous experience…"
1956,3225,"Hello future travelers to to or from dublin. Dublin airport is the biggest airport in Ireland. It’s quite busy, but usually the flights are on time. They rarely get cancelled (unless it’s Covid or something). It’s really the only airport in Ireland you can go to for long, international flights. I recommend this airport."
1957,3226,"Security machines, some of which were broken. Limited options getting to the airport for early morning flights at 5 and 6. Only a couple of shops and restaurants open."
1958,3227,"Good airport, very well signposted, you never get lost. Very quick check-in. The security check only took 5 minutes."
1959,3228,Small regional airport. Carpark to departure gate less than 15 mins. Friendly local staff. You can take train (800m walk) or regular bus. Unfortunately these are to a timetable not matching flghts so need planning. Everything else is 5☆.
1960,3229,"Departure lounge is way too small. There are 2 gates and there were two planes waiting to depart, one of which was maybe one quarter full, the lounge was jam packed. Farranfore is about a mile away, there is a train station there and that is where bus from Tralee dropped me so a bit of a walk. That said security was fast and efficient and the airport is kind of quaint"
1961,3230,"One of the fastest security I've had. 2 minutes max it took. Nice little airport with two gates. Very satisfied. However, it could do with a bit more facilities as there is only 1 duty free and one bar. Quite difficult to get to the airport with out a car or taxi."
1962,3231,Lovely little airport in the south-western tip of Ireland. No one at passport control for some reason. Very quick passport control.
1963,3232,"THis is a small regional airport...car park to airplane seat is generally less than 15 minutes. Easy park, check in and short walk to air craft steps. Friendly staff"
1964,3233,"Small regional airport with adequate facilities and efficient, helpful staff. A breeze to disembark, claim baggage, and exit within a few minutes. Do note that as a modest airport, all passengers embark/disembark directly on the apron - there are no air-bridges."
1965,3235,Passed through the airport with ease.
1966,3236,Very efficent and quick airport to use... staff are very friendly and helpful.
1967,3237,no coffee
1968,3238,"Was surprised at the compulsory €10pp airport development tax. Apparently, AerLingus make it clear that it exists, but Ryanair hide it in the smallprint."
1969,3239,"Very convenient car rental (several companies), however public bus seems infrequent due to remoteness"
1970,3240,Very handy airport and is more aimed at getting you to your destination rather than having the most modern and advanced airport. Friendly staff and very little queing. Our flight to Liverpool was very convenient and only took 40 minutes! It was easy to find a parking space in the large car park but the price of the car park was rather expensive being €9 per day. Overall I thought this was a lovely airport and enjoy my trip through it every time.
1971,3242,"Arriving at Knock Airport is a very easy experience. With very little distance walked or time wasted going through arrivals. However, if you are hiring a car, it may take sometime to get it organised. Departing from Knock was less than good. For one, There were not enough desks available for our flight or in operation at all. Secondly, you have to pay an Airport Development Fee for using the airport before you can go to the departure lounge. It is 10 euros per person over the age of 12. Security was reasonably quick. After passing through security, there is one duty free shop, toilets, one restaurant and a small departure lounge. At the time of travel, there 4 flights leaving within an hour or so. As a result the departure lounge and restaurant was packed with virtually no room. In terms of planespotting, there is a restaurant above the terminal, accessible before going through security, that supposedly offers good views of the apron. Also, when walking out to the plane, the paths used to get to the stands can offer good views of the apron. But other than that it is pretty poor."
1972,3243,Off The flight there were our bags waiting for us. great bar overlooking the runway and the views are unreal you can see for miles small airport in the west of ireland close to Wesport and Galway both wonderful areas and we will be back
1973,3244,"Development fee of 10,00 EUR seems rather unnessecary !"
1974,3245,"Small, no-frills airport, in a good way though. Very handy, and the best way to reach the west of Ireland... or escape it."
1975,3247,LOVE THIS AIRPORT! THE MOST HANDY THING EVER :)
1976,3248,A peaceful airport making it a relatively relaxing process to get through security and ono the flight
1977,3249,"From getting off the bus to reaching the gate (no bag drop, had checked in online), took 6 minutes."
1978,3250,"Shannon is the best Airport in the country,Parking, Airport facility's,check in,pre US clearence,lounge all 5⭐ rating"
1979,3251,Always a pleasure to land in Shannon no waiting for gates .customs and baggage is a breeze all done within 15 min of arrival. Pleasent staff and rental car pick up is so easy and no heavy traffic to deal with when you arrive great airport great staff I will take this any day over Dublin.
1980,3252,Always so easy to fly from SNN . From parking to check in and the helpful friendly staff all stress and hassle free.
1981,3253,Always a pleasure to travel through Ireland's friendliest airport .No lines at immigration and baggage reclaim is quick free wifi all over terminal is clean and staff are friendly and caring.
1982,3254,Always a pleasure to travel through Shannon quick check in hassle fee security short lines car park to getting to boarding gate 20 minutes.I noticed a marked improvement in airport facilities and staff that greated me all had friendly smiles.
1983,3255,Always a pleasure to travel through Shannon terminal has been upgraded nice retail units for coffee/breakfast
1984,3256,Always great to travel through SNN easy parking short walk to terminal friendly faces swift check in effiecent security lines and good onto me departures . A lot of work has been done to enhance the customers experience .Terminal facilities have been upgraded
1985,3257,Always a pleasure to travel through SNN Free wifi quick check in no security lines its travelling made easy and friendly staff .
1986,3260,Small airport so everything is easy. You can even get a steam train to the airport and request a stop at Ronaldsway
1987,3261,"Easy by bus or taxi to get to the airport. Don't arrive too early though unless you bring your own entertainment, tiny island airport and one small shop to browse once through security. Security is super quick and has never taken more than 10 minutes"
1988,3262,"The lounge was closed due to staffing issues. It is only open during limited hours, which precluded my early evening departure. It looks like a nice lounge."
1989,3263,"Simplistic yet functional airport. No long queues, especially at check-in, short distances to walk (useful for passengers with disabilities) and an updated security area with friendly staff. The departure lounge consists of a Costa Coffee with high-street prices and a small convenience shop, nothing more is needed really as you probably won't spend long there. There's only 5 gates meaning no having to walk for a mile to reach the aircraft, and baggage reclaim starts mere minutes after landing. Parking is right outside the terminal for a fee after half an hour, but long term parking is available further away with more affordable prices."
1990,3264,"The airport took my breath away! I had ultra fast check in nobody was queuing, speedy security and... hardly any one in the terminal building! The lounge is really nice for the size of the airport. Its only a 1-2 minute walk to the aircraft and nobody on the baggage claim. A VERY SMOOTH EXPERIENCE!!"
1991,3265,A small friendly airport with adequate seating/facilities for it's size. A 2-3 minute walk from the aircraft has you outside the terminal at the taxi rank. Decent departure lounge which rarely gets busy. Friendly security staff and very clean.
1992,3266,"For a small airport, very good. Clean and modern with friendly security staff (that's not very common in my experience!)"
1993,3267,"Very nice, customer friendly airport, security and baggage pickup was smooth and quick."
1994,3268,For the size of the airport it is good and very well equipped
1995,3269,"For a small regional airport it is good, I fly out of here alot as this is my local airport."
1996,3272,Customer service agent at the King David Lounge was very helpful and was able to switch me to a bulkhead window seat.
1997,3273,Given difficult circumstances staff all worked marvellously and all normal facilities in T3 were open
1998,3274,always love ben gurion!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! even though it was the busiest day of the year everything went so smooth and fast!!!!!!!!!!!!
1999,3275,"Great Airport! getting there is very easy using public transport. Check lines can be a long wait during peak seasons. Free Wi-Fi, great food!"
2000,3276,"Getting to Terminal 1 by public transport is not very comfortable, especially for flights that require early arrival. the security check had only one post working which made a queue. Other than that, everything is fast, comforts to sit down, charge cell phones, drinking water to drink and more. More than commendable. Automatic, fast, and efficient migrations"
2001,3277,"Straight off plane on to terminal 1 bus, straight through border control (only a couple of people ahead of us) and only about a 5 minute wait for bags. Had purchased train tickets in advance and station is right in front of arrivals so very easy onward travel"
2002,3278,"Hand luggage only, quick progress through airport and immigration were not too bad (10 minute queue)"
2003,3279,Terminal 1 is clearly aimed at budget airlines. Food outlets all poor quality and nowhere to sit and work.
2004,3280,"Very busy with 260 departues a day, but they manage it very well, quick security check and support with the automatic face detection that is not perfect yet. All in all well organised and with the best security tools available. We recommend Ben Gurion for all Israel tourists that visit Tel-Aviv, Haifa or Jerusalem. Visitors going to Eilat can fly to the wonderful new airport Ramon from Vienna or Rome by Wizz from November until March. Ramon and Eilat are tax free."
2005,3282,"Quite annoying that there are no phone charger slots in the departure area, and neither are 230V sockets. The toilet has one socket, but who wants to stand in the toilet to charge their phone. I'm completely aware that this is a small provincial airport but in 2022 this is unacceptable. Be prepared with a power bank and a fully charged phone here!"
2006,3283,The airport is completely renewed and upgraded. The new main hall is really nice and spacious. You can find a couple of nice duty frees full of good quality typical products. The wifi is really efficient
2007,3285,"When we arrived, we got the luggage in 5 mins. There wasn't a long walk, the airport is small. There should be more shops, more signs for the car rentals."
2008,3286,"Bus stop actually doesn't look like a bus stop, so be aware not to wait on the wrong place like us. The bus stop is on the right when you exit the terminal, marked by the sign NCC in the middle of concrete."
2009,3287,Good small airport
2010,3288,Nice little airport..! Really uncomplicated and fast getting through ;-)
2011,3289,"Nice small airport, but not very clean :/"
2012,3290,bad info about autoboto/tickets
2013,3291,Very good!
2014,3292,"Getting to the airport after landing is nice but the queue is a bit long, 4 stars Terminal facilities are good WiFi works good like stansted. Randomly rated food and retail services and lounge just 5 stars randomly, I have no explanation. I dunno what immigration/customs are Baggage claim was fast and good."
2015,3293,Medium airport. It is the only one in the Marche Region and the biggest in its catchment area. Connected to Ancona by rail and buses. It is also connected to Rome by rail. The Castelferretti station is in front of the airport.
2016,3294,"Nice airport, small but well kept. It has quite new buldings, two terminals for departures and arrival. I think it is sufficient for the amount of traffic and passengers. Inside of the departure terminal you can find different bars and food shops. To get to the airport there is a new shuttle service that you can take from many stops along its route which starts from Ancona rail station. Otherwise if you like more get to the airport with your car, there is a big car park close to the arrival terminal. In the last few months they are bulding new structures such us an hotel and complementary services."
2017,3295,"To go to the airport : bus ""Raffaello"" expensive; better by train to Castelferrata, station just in front of the terminal (use the subway Under the tracks). Separate terminals for arrivals and departures."
2018,3297,nice airport!
2019,3298,"Classic little airport, European passport check was too long, and if you rent a car it is difficult to find the parkings."
2020,3299,"Airport which I believe was recently renovated, very beautiful and well organised. Very easy to reach by train from Bari centre."
2021,3300,"They recently renovated the airport and now It is way better than the past! I wish it had more connections to Taranto and other places in Apulia. Tourists are ""forced"" to rent a car for bad connections in our region (I'm from Apulia) !"
2022,3301,"Little but modern and pretty airport. Check-in and security check are very fast. Food is good, and there are enough facilities. There are no lounges and it is served by a few airlines."
2023,3302,"Really nice and modern airport, quite big and bright, everything is perfect, the best airport in southern Italy, there are many international connections with the main European capitals also well connected to all the cities in northern Italy"
2024,3303,Very nice and clean airport. The modern railway station will bring you in the downtown in few minutes. I think that it is the best airport in the center-south Italy. The very new building is decorate with sea motifs.
2025,3304,Very clean and clear airport!
2026,3305,One of the most fantastic airport which you could find in south Italy. Really moder and well organized.
2027,3306,"New,big,lighted,the best airport in South-east Italy"
2028,3307,Medium terminal but good airport. From June 2013 will be activated the metropolitan line with the city of Bari.
2029,3308,"Lots of roadwork and road closures getting to P4 parking and no alternative routes were provided. Not enough place for sitting that lead to me and my friends having to sit on the floor (at least it was very clean). No smoking area after security checks which is again a big no no for me. Not a lot of food options after security checks. We had an espresso before security checks in a bar near the check-in desks, the waiter was very unprofessional and overall not nice."
2030,3309,"Baggage claim was very slow as usual, not enough spaces in the P4 bus to reach our parking, and the road to P4 is very unclear: there's a lot of roadwork in the surrounding streets with lots of road closures and no alternative routing provided."
2031,3311,"Really small and crowded airport that gets packed with people even when there aren't lots of flights. Lack of seats and very limited food and retails services. If you have time, eat on the terminal before the security check."
2032,3312,Getting to the airport is easy. But for me. Little expensive... i wasn't carrying any baggage so i walked 10 minjtes to one bus station and took city bus.
2033,3313,"Cheap sandwich available at the gates. It is an avarage airport.You can reach the airport by train, but when i was there it was out of service was replaced by buses. We reached the airport by bus, but it wasn""t direct. You have to get off from the bus at a pub. From there you have to walk about 15 minutes to the airport."
2034,3316,"There was a delay of 10 to 15 minutes after engine shutdown while we waited for the transfer buses to arrive. Most annoying was that a later Ryanair flight that parked next to us got its buses before we did. This delay did not mean no wait at the baggage carousel. I still had to wait 10 inutes after I had reached the designated carousel. BLG is compact and once in the arrivals hall, it is a short walk to the Marconi Express shuttle to Bologna railway station. The automatic ticket machines seemed a bit tempramental. Most people ahead of me had problems buying tickets. They don't always accept all of the denominations of notes and I even had issues when using my cards. As a result, buying a ticket can take some time. The trains are regular and the journay time is around 10 to 15 minutes."
2035,3318,"Very tiny airport but nice, modern and clean! security and gate in 5 minutes! No good the wi-fi with fee required (2€ for 30 min). Only one snack bar. Toilette tiny but clean. on the first floor there is a large window on the apron! Lounge very small but nice and peaceful!"
2036,3319,"Absolutly fantastic flight from Bolzano, small, little airport. A lot of space inside the Darwin aircraft. Good price level for some european citys!! It was worth it. Checked trough to London with a friend of mine. There where no Problems before and during the flight."
2037,3320,"One of the smallest airport i've ever seen... but nice, clean and tidy! You can wait your flight outside on a bench looking at the airside and then go to the gate thru checkin and security checks in just 5 minutes."
2038,3322,Short walk from the plane to the terminal. Immigration took a little while to clear. Most shops were closed at the time of arrival
2039,3323,"Brindisi is quite a small airport so don't expect too much. The security queues are not long and quite efficient. There is a café/restaurant and small shop airside. Gates are at a glass-fronted area which makes the waiting area quite hot, so don't wear too much clothing in the warmer months."
2040,3324,"Airport crew is doing its best but the MF is severely undersized, having 1/3 of passengers on seats, another sitting on the ground and the last blocking the aisles in hope of finding something to buy : NOT good !"
2041,3325,"Great little airport, modern and pleasant. Separate space for all the car hire companies. Good experience"
2042,3326,"Cagliari has a 'good enough' airport. This time, we didn't take the outside train connected to the airport, since we've got a ride from a friend of us. We used only the luggage conveyor belt from the airport and it was OK. We coudn't find an ATM, but I'm sure that there is one somewhere."
2043,3327,"Overall, Cagliari Airport is quite nice. It is easy to arrive, via car or train, and the check in is pretty fast. The security checks are the best - really really fast! There aren't a lot of shops on the terminal but they generally furnish what you need for a flight. WiFi is available too, but it is simply horrible."
2044,3328,Nice airport with good facilities. Well connected with Cagliari by a train link and with lots of car rentals. WiFi connection available.
2045,3330,Very nice modern airport.
2046,3331,"A pratical airport, not far from city center, with rail access, large but not huge, great amount of services and food courts. It just lacks a good air-conditioning system. Toilets were not very clean either."
2047,3333,"Good airport: little, modern, simple and clean!"
2048,3334,average airport clean and simple
2049,3335,Toilets at the terminal very bad cleaned
2050,3339,"Basic airport, very well maintained, very small, little to restaurant's don't exist, it's literally pic up and leave, and it's mostly finger food like pizza or donuts. duty free is very well stocked (I'd recommend getting the lemon cello there before taking off as it is delicious!) also be on the look out for charger ports (which exist!) as they are always taken. also security and check in are very quick and easy."
2051,3345,If you travel to out of Schengen country you will need at least 30mins to pass the passport check. Having 2 persons for checking the documents of 3 flights is totally not enough. Generally nice airport.
2052,3351,"Relatively small airport. Right outside there is a tram going straight into the city centre for just 1,50 euros."
2053,3352,"This is a cute little airport - from the short walk from the tram to the terminal, to the comfy lounge areas and the short distance to the boarding gates"
2054,3353,"Baggage took a long time to arrive, there are unclear instructions as to how and where, but overall a very beautiful and quiet airport!"
2055,3356,"Florence airport is very small. The airport is very close to the city center, but you will never hear the planes taking off or landing. Very clean, nice toilets, not many shops for food. Staff is ok. Nice airport that should be extended if more tourists arrive."
2056,3357,"A small airport but very colse to the city, FLR is the perfect city airport. Will be soon connected to the city by a tramway. There is a plan to build a longer runway by year 2016. The best solution to arrive in Florence."
2057,3359,Very useful airport. Located close to the one of the most beautiful city in the world. Facilities are growing and with the new runway we will count on new flights without diversions because of the actual short one.
2058,3361,"Nice and small airport, functional and very fast boarding/deboarding. Near to the city and railway station. Inside the airport is there a piadina kiosk, really good! Outside the terminal building, green areas are suitable for the waitings."
2059,3365,"I spent today night on this airport... alone, that`s very nice that security allow to stay inside for a night cose outside was raining, airport is close for a night so i was there alone :)"
2060,3366,"Extremely small, everything closed, expensive bus."
2061,3370,"Fast security, free and fast wifi, check in and boarding was really easy. Passport control was fast on departure, a little bit slow on arrival. A good experience overall"
2062,3371,The airport is undergoing expansion and renovation and it's getting better everyday. Great food and views of the runway and the sea. In less than 10 minutes by car you're in the city centre. Free wifi was working great! I hope in the future it will get more flights!
2063,3372,"Regional airport, recently renovated, its strong point is that it is easy to reach, and the check-in and gates are all close by!!"
2064,3373,"Small airport, but little by little it is expanding, fast security checks, and friendly staff (which is more unique than rare), directions quite easy to follow, very clean, and efficient."
2065,3375,"Small, no-frills but manageable. Wish there was an clear public transport method to a nearby train station."
2066,3376,"Small airport but easy to reach. The check-in staff were really great, all working together to find a solution for me because my flight was canceled due to fog. The new VIP Room is beautiful!"
2067,3377,"Quaint airport with minimal facilities, but it works for me. In practice this means that it's only a short taxi to the runway. Security is often really fast, which is definitely a plus. Staff is friendly too. Arriving from the UK is a less pleasant experience: the queues for passport control are often long, and so is the wait for checked in baggage. On the other hand, both departing and arriving with continental flights is often a breeze! Despite its convenient location for me, the airport is tricky to get to/from if you don't have a car or want to take an overpriced taxi. Public transport barely goes there, although there is a shuttle coach available if you want to go to the centre. I don't mind walking, but there are few suitable pedestrian walkways and minimal signposting. The nearby neighbourhoods suffer very little noise, as departure routes are climbing over the sea first. Overall, it has the bare necessities but it could improve."
2068,3378,passing the security checks and getting to the gate took only 10 minutes. Small but there everything you need.
2069,3379,"Genoa Airport is a cool city airport, just a few minutes ride (by bus and taxi) from the city center. The airport is undergoing a substantial renovation, with improved facilities and better services for passengers. Major structural improvements and an expansion of the terminal are planned for the next couple of years. It's going to be an operating base for Volotea starting in the first months of 2017. A dedicated railway station is planned for the next years."
2070,3380,"I come a lot of time in Lamezia Terme and in Calabria, I like the airport because it is small and I never experienced very long queues, but even if the airport has a free Wi-Fi it is not the best, on food and lounge I don’t have much to say because there is only a great restaurant and a Cafe"
2071,3382,From non-shengen countries during coronavirus: Long queues through passport control. Temperature checks.
2072,3385,"Yes we need. People from Calabria that live outside of the region are more than 1 million, and Calabria is in the top 3 italian region per number of beaches, and has three ski resorts. During all year it's full of touristic presence. Moreover, Calabria is the region with the larger number of historic buildings in Italy. Must be greater."
2073,3386,"well organised, friendly airport - but why do they need such a big airport in the middle of nowhere ?!? Paid by EU ?"
2074,3387,"Small airport, lazy crew"
2075,3388,"LMP is nice, quiet and small airport, witch does not have duty free shops. It has only a bar at the arrivals area. At the secured area you can find some automat machines. For this small airport is enough services."
2076,3389,"A year after, still a brand new airport, clean, small, and simple."
2077,3390,Brand new airport inaugurated this day.
2078,3393,"Good airport with a lot of different catering options and pretty clean toilets BUT they was no socket to charge my phone close to the gates, only 2 free USB sockets in the entire waiting area. As I had my flight ticket on my phone, I had to pay to have access to a locker where you can charge your phone."
2079,3395,Great airport but loses a star due to uncooperative Ryanair Dispatcher who even at request of Cabin Crew would not assist us to transit to our connecting flight due to late arrival of our first flight. Dispatcher wore hives jacket marked FONZ
2080,3400,A lovely airport with loads of facilities but let down by requirement to pay to charge your phone. A fair distance from Milan though but bus cheap and efficient
2081,3401,First time I depart from Linate since I usually depart from Malpensa. Very modern terminal full of shops and restaurants. Even if the airport is small you have to walk a bit before arriving at the gates.
2082,3402,A small and convenient airport close to the city center of Milan. I can only recommend to fly in and out of Linate.
2083,3403,Small and convenient airport close to the city. Quiet extensive duty free selection considering the seize of the airport
2084,3404,"You don't need anymore to put liquids and electronics out of your bag, you can even get past the security check with your own bottle of water! It's a win"
2085,3407,"The airport is OK, small like any other city airport. Annoying the need to go a longer way up and down and around the airport just to have you go through the shop area."
2086,3409,In the UK-EI departure zone there are not a lot of places where to seat. 5 flights departing at the same time and around 100 chairs.
2087,3410,3 stars for facilities because I am missing a water filling station as common now in many other airports. Had to buy a bottle of water.. and generate plastic waste.
2088,3412,"Most of the businesses were closed as I was on a night flight. However, there was a limousine taxi stand that offered fixed prices to the city, and our family were on our way to Milan in a black Mercedes van(T.M.I as a car guy, I know these vans are literally just vans with Mercedes logos on them) with a reasonable price."
2089,3413,"Great airport, full of facilities at any level (even for non passengers) quite long ques at security controls, so get to the airport at least 3 hours before departure. Arrivals are managed quite fast, customs, immigration and luggage claim are easy. I got my baggage 20 minutes after getting down the aircraft. WiFi is unlimited with no registration and food/beverage is ok price, in the duty free you could also find some good prices on selected products."
2090,3414,"Malpensa had a slight delay. The Emirates lounge was not catered properly and the TSA was very backed up. Even though I git there 3 hours early, I still nearly missed my flight."
2091,3417,One point taken for pre-boarding of PAX to the cold outside and later they complained to us about waiting to enter the aircraft for too long.
2092,3420,"WOW! Actually quite efficient, but the boarding price was a bit disorganized… luckily for us the EK ground crew staff made it (the experience) much more enjoyable and seamless for us at the airport’s Terminal 1. Parking is very far by walking distance, one has to take an extremely long walk on a white bridge."
2093,3422,The airport of Naples is too small for the high traffic. Small terminal also but good security check and duty free
2094,3423,Actually quite lovely. Check in was very quick. There was no line. Security as well was barely 3 minutes. WiFi was great and there were loads of good cafes to attend to. Much better than my previous visits to Italian airports.
2095,3424,"Only a few toilets far away. Quick but not very precise security check with non stop rolley conveyor (quite stupid if people want to grap their things, isn't it?). Quite good and straight navigation. We had no problems to sit. Long lines to Alibus to city center. Also the bus costs 5 € per person which is maybe cheapest from the other options, but still quite expensive for crowded and delayed bus."
2096,3425,"Airport is very beautiful, in principal for spotting, with multiplan parking and her view on the apron. If you must to depart at the sunrise, you can sleep in the airport ;)"
2097,3427,"The airport is very crowded and confusing, with passport control being very hard to find and the general lack of good navigation."
2098,3428,"This disinfection station at the airport is mucho confuso. Also infrastructure is terrible. You know that in some airport in Eastern Europe you have train, public transport, ubers, motorways etc.. Don't get tricked by the image of Western Europe because this place doesn't deserve it at all! Take milion hours in advance to go to the airport. Don;t count on some ticket machine card payment any faicilities from civilized world."
2099,3429,Immigration process is very quick thanks to automatic gates. Quite a lot of choices of food inside the terminal. You can buy Mozzarella di Buffala from the airport (much more expensive than in the city).
2100,3430,"A very nice terminal, clean and has good food and retail outlets airside. Love the charger points on the seats."
2101,3431,"Small and efficient airport! I have flown to Olbia airport many times, and once again I highly recommend it. To date, the airport offers many services for passengers, such as Wi-Fi and the availability of the lounge (which, however, is only accessible by paying and is not part of the Priority Pass network, too bad). The terminal is very new and clean, and the management is excellent! It is also very connected to many Italian and European cities, as well as having 1 intercontinental flight, the very nice Dubai-Olbia!"
2102,3432,"Airport bus is cheap (around 1.30€) but the parking facility is a scam. Entered by mistake and got charged on exit 2.50€ flat fee, despite staying inside no more than 1-2 minutes."
2103,3433,"Olbia airport is the main one in the northern Sardinia area. Paid car parking in good condition. Quick and easy check-in, security check and passport control. I advise all those who need to reach Sardinia to land in Olbia (OLB), because it is well connected with other European airports."
2104,3434,"Once again, very rude personnel at the gate. Same gender discrimination, where the women are allowed to take a suitcase and a purse into hand luggage and men are forced to pay when travelling with suitcase and a backpack. WiFi couldn't obtain IP address"
2105,3435,"Inconvenient shopping at the restaurants (first choose goods, then queue at the checkout and buy a voucher and then queue again and pick up the goods you paid for). Too complicated for me - I don't buy anything there."
2106,3436,"Small but modern airport. The main building is very clean and washrooms are very good to use, too. Maybe the terminal/gates area is a little unorganized."
2107,3437,"Very nice brand new airport, very clean and luminous, unlimited wifi. The airport size is perfect small but not too much, many shops in the boarding area and in the public area as well. Except the fact that the check in and the safety may be very slow that's one of the best airport i've experienced."
2108,3438,Pretty well organized. Some shops and restaurants. More than ok for a small regional airport.
2109,3443,Nothing exceptional about the airport. It is very easy to reach. Easy to navigate. A pity there is very limited viewing on the spectacular surroundings of the airport. The worst thing is the lack of seating: very poor.
2110,3445,"The Trenitalia train goes inside the airport, in a 1-our trip from Palermo. It is a nice and simple airport. It had a clean restroom close to the gates A/B. The only lounge was closed in december/2022 because of Covid (they say). Amiable people on the security line. The departure gate was created for low cost/low fare companies like Ryanair: a large waiting area with a path to the outside, where we took a bus to the plane (hey, great! it was not a long 'death march' to the plane)."
2111,3446,"Very large, spacious airport and well organized down to the smallest details. At the moment there is work underway on the lower and upper levels of the gates and gates to reach the plane"
2112,3447,"I’ve flown to/from this airport so many times, I saw the changes that they have done. They are still renovating it, and they are doing a good job. It remains a small airport, but not in a bad sense. The terrace on departures floor overlooking the sea has always been my favorite spot, hope they finish working on it soon. The arrival on this airport is always so beautiful, so book a window seat!"
2113,3448,"At the Palermo Falcone e Borsallino international airport, located in Punta Raisi, it is very simple to reach it by shuttle bus or regional train. Inside the airport a major change has been made to the arrivals and boarding terminals. as soon as you board, instead of finding yourself under the sun waiting for the bus that will take you to the aircraft, you find yourself under a metal structure equipped with air conditioners"
2114,3450,"Crowded, not well signed airport. Due to so called covid they removed toilet seat, so... looks like you could get covid throu your anus. No paper towels as well (coz you might die of covid when you use towels, obviously better run around with wet hands) in overal a bit messy and not so clean place."
2115,3455,"Small airport in Pescara, Abruzzo.Many flights available; Aerostation very well-located, near the SS5 route and A14 motorway;Also recheable with buses (6-21pm ). Parking is a bit expensive (1 day 6am/22.50 pm €11)"
2116,3457,"Small airport in central Italy. It has 20 flights day A/R. The gates are 3/4. The lavatories are clean. There check in desks very comfortable; security controls average. Boarding always on foot. They do not have fingers. It's very easy to reach it, via BUS/train or car by SS5/ RA PE-CH (highway is free)"
2117,3460,"There is a big lack of seats at Pisa, airside. There are seats for no more than one plane load, and not much room for those who must remain standing. Very uncomfortable."
2118,3461,"kinda crowded, almost no free seats in the gate area. also, the restrooms are way too small for an airport. other than that, pretty good."
2119,3463,The airport certainly looks a bit outdated with the majority of services showing their age but no problems
2120,3465,Not a bad provincial airport. Opportunites to buy a meal were limited to sandwiches. I would have preferred something more.
2121,3466,"Coronavirus standard operation: the single flight that whole day. No cafeteria or restaurant, police checking if you are not an italian running from the country etc."
2122,3467,"Overall good enough for this kind of a reasonable small airport. You can get to the airport with a unmanned people mover from Pisa Central train station and the Airport parking lot. Check happend quickly, but the security check was a bit unhandy. If you have got something inside your suitcase that has to go in a separate box to go true x-ray you don't have any platform to unpack your suitcase, that was in my opinion a bit annoying."
2123,3468,"Walkable to Tower of Pisa in 35 minutes, or €12 by taxi. Useful if your flying Moscow-Bristol via Pisa!"
2124,3469,"All the maine services are covered by this airport. What must be improved it's the boarding area which is very very narrow, short and dark. That's makes boarding very confused."
2125,3473,"It is a small but good airport. The airport located near to the coastline. You can reach by bus or by trolleybus but, if you choose trolleybus, you have to walk next to the road without pavement. The airport has a really good terrace which is free. You can spot your plane from here. There is no big glass so you can take photos. We made a little round before RMI airport due to the airport wasn't in operation yet."
2126,3474,"It is a small but good airport. The airport located near to the coastline. You can reach by bus or by trolleybus but, if you choose trolleybus, you have to walk next to the road without pavement. The airport has a really good terrace which is free. You can spot your plane from here. There is no big glass so you can take photos."
2127,3477,Very clean and organised airport with great views. It is easy to reach by public transport. The duty free store inside was quite small and expensive (the cheapest bottle of water was 1.70 €). There weren't many souvenirs to choose from but that won't dissapoint anyone by the incredible descent and takeoff sceneries.
2128,3478,"The arrivals terminal is very small and easy to navigate but one big dissadvantage is that in order to go in the city centre you don't have a lot of options to choose (even if there are plenty of busses and different routes to different places in Rome, the staff and the bus drivers couldn't help me with any information about where to buy the tickets). In the end I had to choose the bus to Termini, wich wasn't my final destination. There were more than 8 bus stands but no ticket machines. The bathrooms were very clean"
2129,3480,"Bought tickets for bus from Termini to Ciampino Airport could not see any signs where to go and asked for directions, told at side of building found sign which said bus stop to airports but it was only an advert the real stop was way down at the end of the building and could not be seen in the dark. When we did locate the stop the bus was already pulling out and we missed it. It was the last bus at 18.30."
2130,3481,"In my opinion Rome airport is very well located from the city centre . The access is very good , buses leave from Roma termini station every few tens of minutes . The check-in at the airport is without major problems, depending on the volume of passenger traffic. There are no complaints about security control either. The only thing is a bit high prices in duty-free shops and poorly-kept toilets in the area of the departure hall."
2131,3483,"very small and cramped, few places to rest, exercise, shops, queues everywhere. security is more or less moving."
2132,3485,"Airport has a lot of bad reviews. A goodman of these are due to people not reading the info that the airport is shut for a few hours after midnight, so turning up hoping to slip on the floor. Otherwise very efficient, €30 taxi ride from central Rome compares very favourably with UK prices, check in works well, as does security. The Schengen Terminal (A) is buffer than the non-Schengen one, so stay there if flight from B and then move across with an hour to go (or when a flight about to leave B) and you will get to sit in both, unless there is a massive hold up in flights. But all airports a shambles in such situations. Wifi is very fast and unlimited in time which is also nice and a fair number of power points dotted about."
2133,3488,"Improved airport services, fast check-in and reasonable queues. excellent catering and affordable prices. Excellent train connects from Rome Termini to Fiumicino airport"
2134,3490,"Always a pleasure travelling through FCO airport, modern and full of shops and restaurants to spend some time while waiting, security checks very quick and wifi available. One of the best airports in Europe."
2135,3491,This review is about arrival. The airport is quite nice although some passages are not too wide. Immigration is quite slow and baggage claim is very slow.
2136,3492,"Facilities on the Schengen side have improved much since the renovation. Airport is still very well connected by train. What has got worse though (and this is a luxury/niche problem), is the Schengen lounge for Star Alliance Gold travelers. Previously, the Star Alliance Gold lounge was excellent. But, now this one is no longer accessible, and the contract lounges aren’t as good (especially overcrowded). I admit, it’s a luxury problem"
2137,3493,30 minutes away from Rome Termini central train station via Leonardo express train. Make sure to take only Leonardo express. Terminal was nice
2138,3494,"Very big airport, the lounge in Terminal 3 was very small and not clean. Nice planespotting areas placed around the airport."
2139,3496,The capital's airport is beautiful! Easy to reach and very modern and technological (and also smart)! I recommend everyone to go there...
2140,3498,"Nice small airport. The free-WiFi doesn't work, but the check-in is very very fast and the security check really amazing :) Not a lot of duty free shops. The way to go to the airport is very good. The boarding area offers a very good sight on the tarmac."
2141,3499,"Small airport. There is a store with wine, pasta and other small items. We didn’t find fault with our carry-on luggage, although we had a noticeable excess. Other passengers' luggage was weighed and they even offered to pay for excess weight of 1 kg."
2142,3500,Very beautiful and cared for
2143,3502,much beter than manchester no quewing and being prodyed about there 100
2144,3504,Italien class airport :-(
2145,3505,Very nice stuff
2146,3506,Small and chaotic low budget airport. Completely overpriced transfer by local bus.
2147,3507,"This airport limits the time for passing the security check. One cannot pass security only 120 minutes before the flight. This also limits the time into the lounge, located in the airside. The lounge doesn't have attendants so a PIN is necessary to get in. This PIN is acquired before the security check."
2148,3508,"Since my flight was the last that day, Duty Free was closed, as well as other shops. The only place to be open was a mix of a coffeeshop and a store."
2149,3509,"Train to the Airport is okay, sadly Airport is far away from City Center. Small But really nice Airport, good Prices, normal to long Queues and friendly Staff. just the wifi was too slow I can recommend this little Airport :)"
2150,3510,"Close enough to Udine. If you have an early flight and get there early its a breeze otherwise the security is a little slow, but that is a necessary delay for travelers today. There are connections available to major cities in Italy as well as neighboring countries. It gets me where I want to go without having to drive to Marco Polo. There is a toll from Udine, about 4 Euros but then again its less than going to MP which would be about 9 Euros. We use it always and its quite perfect for our needs."
2151,3511,"A small,old airport,but very useful to get in that zone"
2152,3512,A well laid out airport. All amenities at hand and not too large to find your way around.
2153,3514,"the breakfast in all the bars is very good, the merchandising is fabulous not to mention the entrance"
2154,3515,Arriving in TRN is fine it is relatively small and there were only small queues at immigration. The train is the easiest way to the city. Onward bus connections are a little more complicated for first time arrivals.
2155,3516,The airport is easy to get to from the the city by the train link. The airport is small and easy to travel through. The lounge gives good views over the runway. Facilities are limited.
2156,3517,"The airport have now a very good terminal, with very nice shops, various bar and restaurants, also local food and beers. It's not yet so easy get to the airport ( because I think the train is always the better way to go to the center of a town, and the Turin one, it arrive nowhere in the north of city). By the way there is now Car2Go with a small parking outside the terminal, so it's cheaper and faster going where you want to go in Torino. I love Turin Airport so much...."
2157,3518,"Small one. But it has all you need. Very fast security check. Train to the airport, unfortunately it doesnt go often and not to the city center. Awesome view over Alps when starting/landing"
2158,3519,"very smart airport; easy to reach from city center even by car or bus. I think that bus service should be improved as many taxis await without clients while bus park are crowded and bus seems not to be enough. only one bus company serves airport: competitors? good fast track service: 5€ if you do not have any VIP card or status; even lounge is available paying. landside area with a bad and expensive restaurant, while airside had some better place to eat. no regional food instead you can find mozzarella from napoli; quite tricky. security staff rude and sometimes impolite often engaged in personal discussions. it could be better."
2159,3520,"It is a small airport, but well organised. Pubblic transport to city is not so good, but access from motorway is very easy, no problem to get there by car or taxi. Security might take some time in rush hours, but is efficient. Plenty of waiting places, some good shops."
2160,3521,"Nel.y asphalted way to the airport, arrival smooth and fast. No check-in-in (everything online), fast track up to its name, great shops (the only Tiger shop in an Italian airport), wifi very fast and easy to connect. Sandwiches as well a typical cappuccino with croissant very expensive, for being in Italy. Piemonte lounge clean with nice assortment of food and drinks. Easy access on board with channel to the bridge. Upon arrival, you are led again on the shop level, with access to arrival via escalator. Nice thing if you feel like having a coffee"
2161,3522,"Flying over 40 years from this airport, my home town. Now it is modern, efficent, everything nice and smooth running. Just baggage claim is sometimes slow in peak hours. Taxis to city quite expensive and sometimes low quality."
2162,3523,Pretty quiet airport. Really spacious. Sometimes really crowded like in my flight but it is nice with alot of services. Security was slow.
2163,3524,"Security was fast. Not much food or beverages available near the gates, nothing downstairs at all. Huge line for the one place upstairs. No working urinals in the men's room, and only two stalls."
2164,3525,"Check-in was long but with RyanAir what do you expect? Excellent wifi, fast security, and decent restaurants. The only airport I have loved in Italy."
2165,3527,Great signage for English speakers. A large carpark at the front and an excellent dock attached to the facility for easy transfer to and from the Venetian islands. All staff were very helpful and very pleasant.
2166,3529,"Best airport in Italy, quite well kept and with a nice view of the lagoon. One of the best lounges in Europe. Multiple parking quite close to the terminals"
2167,3531,"First time at this airport. Its very good. Big windows for spotting planes. You have a direct bus service from venice, venice mestre, lido di jesolo and other major attractions around the airport."
2168,3532,"Okay airport quality, security check goes smoothly, though long (July 2022: 25+ mins waiting). There were enough seats for waiting passengers, clean toilets and good quality wifi - 0,5 mb/s for non registered users and 5 for 3 hours for e-mail verified users, everything for free. Silent airport - you need to look at the information boards by yourself, there are no callouts. There's bus and boat to the city centre (or also Mestre city), but it requires an additional type of public transport ticket. Expensive food and drinks. No viewing terrace, unless you go to lounge probably (can't be fully sure of it, as I didn't try it during my visit). Bad problem situation handling - Easyjet flight to Berlin was delayed and the passengers did not know for a long time where to go, help point didn't open for quite a time as well."
2169,3533,"This time getting to the airport was way smoother than at arrival, but again the bathrooms need an refreshment and also the non-Schengen gates area was cramped. By the time boarding started everyone was sweating and because of the airport's way of organization, we also left Treviso 30 minutes late. Otherwise, the rest of the airport had a great Duty Free area with lots of souvenirs to choose from and over all the airport's presentation impressed me."
2170,3534,"The bathrooms were quite outdated and also at the security control there were not enough employees for the number of passengers arriving. The transit system to and from the airport is chaotic, with plenty of busses (especially the no. 101 to Padua) that didn't stop at the bus station and continued their journey without picking the passengers that were waiting to get at their hotels and rest."
2171,3535,"Small airport we just arrived here we didn't try the departure from here. The WC was ok. The bus stop to the railway station is really close, you can use it to reach the railway station."
2172,3539,"Short ways, easy access (public transport), efficient. But: Taxis are expensive from Trevino center or station to the airport."
2173,3540,"Small airport only couple of gates, check-in que was long, almost no facility, food was limited for our long waiting time."
2174,3542,Airport has been well renuved since the last time i was here (last year). there are significantly more boards with english and there is a phone/laptop charger station thing.
2175,3543,Pretty small but i see they are making a new terminal for the winter olympics in 2026! Very far from where we stayed but thats fine
2176,3544,"VRN offers a quick and cheap direct bus-link to Verona Porta Nuova railway station, running about every 20 minutes throughout daytime, and taking just 15 minutes to cover the distance. The passenger terminal proper has the pros and the cons of a small-scale airport, with minimal time wastage going from plane-side to kerbside, but with limited retail offers. Yet, it does the job very nicely."
2177,3545,aeroporto molto piccolo ma molto ben costruito. all'esterno all'entrata dell'aeroporto ci sono dei lavori in corso che ti costringeranno a fare un giro un po' più lungo per raggiungere i check-in o i controlli di sicurezza. invece all'interno e' tutto ben organizzato e anche per le persone appena atterrate gli aspetterà una sala ben ventilata e strutturata con i bagagli che arrivano intorno ai 2/5 minuti.
2178,3546,"Again, small and nothing to do. Only 2 small cafe’s. I hope the new terminal is going to be better."
2179,3547,Quite small airport. Nothing big to do. Wifi isn’t really good. Immigrations and Custums only had 1 person which took almost 2 hours to get there. Only 2 Facillites. Wifi was good but it was hard to connect. No food at all only sweets and chocolates exept for 2 very small cafe’s. I did notice a new terminal is getting built so could be better!

2181,3552,"Very nice airport, no fingers but only bus taxi, good personal and infrastructure, out of airport there are the bus for the central station of verona every 20 minutes, not too much expensive (6 euros)"
2182,3559,"Maybe there is a little rose tinted glasses effect being on holiday, but I had no issues with the airport. Everything seemed to go to plan. It is a little away from the resort I was heading to, but they laid on a bus."
2183,3560,"The airport is a bit of a throwback to the airports of the past. Not a bad thing, to be honest. The only thing which I really disliked about the airport was that everything in the shops was priced in US$ and I was carrying Jam$."
2184,3561,mbj is a comfortable modern airport check in can be very chaotic especially in peak season nov-apr after check in upstairs is spacious with lots of shops and seating
2185,3562,"As with a lot of airports, having priority checked bags means nothing because they don't come out first. This was another example of where I had to wait 20 mins for my bag even though it had a priority tag. The first two deliveries of bags were non-priority, so it makes a joke of the priority system"
2186,3563,"Used Club Mobay lounge - well worth it, good food and drink and super quick WiFi. Passport and security checks were quick. Plenty of shops and restaurants, big, clear windows to see outside."
2187,3564,Extremely high prices for food and duty free. Staff at food court was such unfriendly and aggressively demanded a tip of 15 to 20% for such a poor service.
2188,3565,Extremely extensive Food/drinks after passing the security check. Also the duty free shop is overprized.
2189,3566,"Checkin is a nightmare. Why easy, when complicated works as well? Waited 1,5 hours, had to do nonsens manual paperwork at the desk. Like writing an additional tag for the suitcase, because own tags are not enough? Food and retail service behind security are very good and variegated."
2190,3571,到着免税の場所がわからず、工事中だったが公式HPにも古い情報しかなかった。国際線ターミナルから地下鉄のある国内線ターミナルまで15分くらいバスに乗るのがだるい。
2191,3572,"Getting to the airport itself was good, the facilities were nice to help us disembark the aircraft and continue our journey. Baggage claim took a while, but immigration and customs was good. A Customs officer asked us nicely if we would participate in a dog drug training test, which me and my family said yes. They placed a scent chip into one of our pockets and the dog sniffed us, and they thanked us for helping with the test before we returned the chip. Fukuoka was a great airport, and I enjoyed it much! Except the WiFi of course. The WiFi was slow and messages often failed to send."
2192,3573,リニューアルされ、地下鉄駅が近くなり、非常に便利な空港となった。 空港内施設も充実している。
2193,3574,The customer service at the premium counter and premium lounge was very good! !
2194,3575,"Domestic terminal renewed with more places to eat before security. International terminal inconvenient access, need to take terminal bus from domestic terminal"
2195,3576,"Great access from city center, facility was not up to expectation. No credit card lounges on air-side either."
2196,3577,"The most wonderful airport staff I have ever experienced. They helped immediately locate my lost bags and paid for their delivery from Shanghai to the hotel I was staying in. I was blown away by their politeness, helpfulness and all round excellence. Thank you Fukoaka!"
2197,3578,Many place is long que but not displaying airline signboard. I mistake different airline check in que..
2198,3579,"A small, efficient international airport. Only odd thing is that the subway does not serve the international terminal. Passengers must take a free shuttle bus, which goes around the airport. The bus from international terminal to domestic terminal takes almost as long as the subway trip to the centre of the city."
2199,3580,"Fukuoka Airport itself is very close to the city, and there is a subway to reach it. However, to get to the domestic terminal, you have to take a free shuttle bus to the international terminal, but it is very fast. Regardless of whether the airport is international or domestic, it is practical but not flashy, so as to suit the characteristics of Fukuoka people."
2200,3582,Food and retail service are mainly before the security check gate. Japan Airline's CIP Lounge is available but a little small. Beer servers are nice.
2201,3583,5/5. An small airport but very nice and clean. I am not gonna tell you why but Hiroshima is my favourite. There is a balcony where you can see all of the airport.
2202,3584,Quaint small airport that is in no way busy. This airport is a long way out of town so be prepared for the 30min bus ride out of Hiroshima to get there.
2203,3585,"The airport is located 50 km from Hiroshima, with good and convenient connections. Small, well organize, friendly staff, no free WiFi. Good accommodation in Hiroshima Airport Hotel (5 min. walk from the terminal)."
2204,3586,"Convenient and surprisingly well-deserved in regard to its location and size. There is even a Starbucks cafe where you can enjoy Japan's westernmost Starbucks Espresso. Access is by bus or taxi to the city 13km away. The observation deck offers a great panorama view over the runway to the North and over the reef to the South. The Food court is convenient and serves local dishes such as Yaeyama Soba and Ishigaki Beef bowls. Currently, only domestic flights are available however the airport has a brand new International terminal ready for flights to Taiwan, Hong-Kong, and Singapore as soon as things become normal again."
2205,3587,"Smaller Aipport with basic facilities. Used taxis to and from. Starbucks landside, but not much airside."
2206,3588,"Very nice small airport with Hawaiian feeling. Ground transportation provided by effective buses from Ischigaki. Airport is clean, and very fast go -through. The shopping facilities are basic, but down-town priced food and drinks are nice. Check-in, baggage drop-off and security is a breeze."
2207,3589,"Superb baggage claim, the bags were already on the belt when I reach the baggage claim area. And there are very little walks thruogh the airport. Surely, it is a small airport serving just one island with mainly only domestic flights, but this is hust how it should work. Fast get baggage and fast get out of airport..."
2208,3591,"Such a cute, little airport."
2209,3593,"The observation deck is large as it is a base airport for JAC.The observation deck has horizontal wires, but it is so far away that the wires can be seen on camera.The 747 engine cowl and flapping information board displayed in the museum near the deck are highlights."
2210,3595,"Airport far from Kagoshima central, bus ride very expensive and couldn’t pay on board which was inconvenient. The airport was larger then expected. Nice viewing deck and a cool airplane museum in the terminal (with flight simulators!) Good choice of Omiyage too."
2211,3596,Smal Japanese airport
2212,3599,Small but cute airport. Very friendly and helpful staff. 3 air-bridges. 2 Bus Companies bring you to downtown Kochi.
2213,3600,"The restaurants in front of the security checkpoint are good. After the security check, there is no BLUESKY, only ANAFESTA. Souvenirs are possible."
2214,3601,"It is smaller airport with International flights from Dubai, Sri Lanka. Kerala is hot and humid. Be prepared to have lot of fluids and avoid traveling distances by road without AC. Kerala is beautiful all along. Food is something where you have to make compromises especially if you are vegetarian. If you can spend book 3/4/5 star hotels for better food and cuisine, this advice is for people who are traveling from outside to kerala. :)"
2215,3602,Kochi is local airport and airport have rich and colorful local products stores^^
2216,3603,"The international terminal at the small, old airport is similar in size to Gwangju Airport, but this one seems to be older."
2217,3604,"Well renovated, maintained, lovery view but a little old airport. 45 minutes from downtown kumamoto and frequently bus services available."
2218,3607,"It can't be helped because it's a small airport, but it would be nice if there were lounges for credit card companies and oral companies. It would be nice to have ANA and JAL shops as well."
2219,3608,"Since there is no taxiway, it was refreshing to make a U-turn at the turn spot on the runway bridge and head to the terminal. The approach changes depending on the wind direction, and it's fun to see Shimojishima Airport. Miyako Blue is more impressive than you can imagine from the sky."
2220,3609,"Even when I'm traveling, I always brush my teeth after every meal, but I always brush my teeth in the corner of the bathroom sink. At Miyakojima Airport, there was water in the courtyard of the arrival lobby on the first floor, and since there was no air conditioning, there was no one around, so I was able to brush my teeth without worrying."
2221,3613,Although the airport is somewhat far from the city. There are many direct trains and the approach path is beautiful.
2222,3614,"Access to NGO airport is best by train as the station terminal is inside the Airport. I wish the airport had more shops and restaurants after the security check. Make sure you had your meal before passing the security check as options are scares after. The Airport closes early so also be prepared. The best things to see and do are the deck from where you can see the runway. Another thing to do is visit the Boeing area called ""Flight of Dreams"" where a real Boeing (Made in Nagoya) is exhibited."
2223,3616,"On this day, a dream lifter came flying in, which is rare. Centrair is the only place where you can see the world's rare planes up close."
2224,3617,"It is worthy of being called the best airport in Japan. The traffic flow design, duty-free shops, and immigration are all very orderly and reasonable. However, there are various things to choose from, such as high-speed design and no fuss. You don't need to rotate to get to Kanayama, Nagoya, and other places by taking a Class 1 train from the nearest train station."
2225,3618,"Outdoor viewing area, excellent Star Alliance Lounge. Short distance to/from plane to ground transportation. Good rail connection to Nagoya and forward. Very open feeling, lots of light inside. Good restaurants on upper level!"
2226,3619,"I got here only this once but overall, it is a decent airport with ample facilities to help flyers kill their time before getting on their planes. There are two things that amazed me when I got here. First, the short walking distance from the plane disembarkation point to the immigration counters. Washrooms are available at certain areas and the cleanliness is maintained at high standard. Secondly, I was amazed by the convenience of the Meitetsu airport line that serves air passengers between the airport to the heart of Nagoya city. All within the reach in 5 minutes walk from the arrival. One must buy the train ticket from either the auto ticket machine or the ticketing counter but don't fret, there are airport volunteers who speak little English but are more than willing to help especially foreigners to get the right tickets to board the train. And their services are for free."
2227,3622,They check your every carry on and ask you to check in if exceed 1cm.
2228,3624,"The baggage drop machine is the latest. easy. Since it was a weekday, the X-ray examination went smoothly. Well, there are many people even on weekdays. Is the boarding rate around 60%? Restaurants are crowded. There are long lines at the famous Okinawa soba store. I didn't use the card lounge."
2229,3626,"Buy Po Tama using the FASTPIC app. Waiting time can be reduced. Daito Sushi was sold out by 6pm. Yui rail is very convenient. If you don't want to rent a car, you can use the Okinawa MaaS app to get discounts on Yui Rail, bus companies, and tourist facilities."
2230,3627,"There’s Some duty free shops in domestic terminal only this airport in japan. Mainly they sell fragrance and some cosmetics. The check in counter always gets SUPER busy, I would recommend you to be at the airport an hour before your boarding time."
2231,3630,So if you happen to have camera gear plus laptop and ipad be prepared to completely empty your bag. i thought it was a random thing last time but this is the second time in a row where they fully emptied my bag
2232,3631,"It was smooth check-in. I did not have baggage to check in, and I only had carry-on baggage. So, I directly proceeded to the gate when I arrived at Naha airport. And, I already had boarding pass printed out at home which saved my time to stop by the kiosk at Jetstar counter. But, by the time, I arrived at the gate, they just started boarding! Because, they use the bus to take passengers to the airplane (which takes more time to board, compare to use the boarding bridge). so you might want to arrive at the gate at least 35 min. before departure. They started boarding 30 min. before the scheduled departure time. In flight service was good. I purchased plus bundle fare ticket, so 500 yen worth of snack and bevarage were included. Flight attendant reminded me at the beginning of the flight that I can choose 500 yen worth of snack and bevarage from the menu. Even if I wanted to purchase the items of more than 500 yen worth, I could pay the difference in cash. Over all, it was nice flight. I think I want to use Jetstar on other trave opportunities."
2233,3637,"Only English information is displayed at the gate. On domestic flights in Japan, we should give priority to japanese people who cannot read English."
2234,3638,"What I remember is that the stewardess was very kind, and that she called my aunt Hideko by the wrong name when she came to pick me up. I pointed this out to her in a bossy way."
2235,3639,"Osaka Itami is my favorite airport in the world. South Terminal is all for ANA, North Terminal is all for JAL. Both feature a great little sit down bar-style quick order and eat spot, with some of the best Katsu Rice Curry I've ever had in Japan. The airport has an easy layout for check-in and security and features an observation deck with great views of the apron and runways! (this is accessible only post security). And as a Av-geek, Osaka Itami has the best departure in the world, with a left hand turn immediately after takeoff with amazing views of the airport from the air and of Osaka!"
2236,3640,"During terminal renovation, some departure area is very narrow. For one world traveler, not served lounge service but served area separated by planted wood ..."
2237,3643,"Not a whole lot going on here. It's very easy and cheap to get here from Osaka or Kyoto though and frequent flights to Tokyo allow for great international connection opportunities. Nothing really in terms of food passed security, but security was quick and my flight left right away so it wasn't a big problem for me. Don't get here early. You'll be too bored."
2238,3644,"Average decent Japanese airport with adequate range of shops and dining options. Access to the airport by public transport a slight pain though as it is not connected to a main metro line but only to a light rail line which you have to take for one stop before changing to a metro line that gets you downtown. Still, better than Kansai's long and expensive train rides."
2239,3645,"Kansai airport is a functional Japanese airport. It is located on an island away from the mainland, so it takes a bit long to get there. The Kansai railway is the best way though. The check in is quite efficient with counters and self service, however the security check was quite slow and disorganized at the time I was there. The actual terminal inside is not over the top, or comparable to the world's best airports, but it still has some nice facilities and has clear signage."
2240,3647,"My father and I got to the airport and when we went to check in, there was a huge line, it took us nearly an hour to get to the front. Once we checked in, we went to floor 2 to get some dinner. Not many restaurants were open at 8 pm. Only McDonalds or beef."
2241,3648,"One of the fastest airport I have seen. On an international flight, from touchdown to leaving the terminal it took me 20 minutes! Unfortunately didnt get the chance to leave from this airport. The airport is a bit far away though. Arrived late in the evening, maybe in day time its more convenient."
2242,3650,Queue for immigration took quite a long time to pass. Getting on a train was a little annoying but bus service connectivity was good.
2243,3651,"The apron terminal has literally nothing opened except airliners lounges (including Korean air's which was very small) and one convenience store. This may be changed since this was 6 months ago, but I recommend you to do all your shopping and stuff before you leave the main terminal."
2244,3652,"Can't be beaten, everything from check-in/bag drop, to security to shops, cleanliness efficiency KIX has it in buckets. Anyone complaining should really try UK airports particularly Manchester."
2245,3653,"Fantastic, anyone who moans about KIX really should try Manchester. Not much more than ten minutes and we were through immigration and had our bags, my all time record from deplaning-immigration-bags-bus ticket bought seven minutes. Spotlessly clean on arrival and very helpful staff should you require them."
2246,3654,"Flying on Peach, you're expected to arrive at Terminal 2, which is mainly for low-cost carriers. The terminal reminds me of what IKEA warehouse and a temporary quarantine location would look like together. Unique, but not so professional."
2247,3656,"There are so many options for dining, shopping, hot springs, movies, etc. that you wouldn't expect to find in an airport. Even in the card lounge, you can clearly see the runway from the window. I'm always having trouble deciding which restaurant to go to in Ramen Street. You can easily stay at a hot spring for 3000 yen."
2248,3657,"Lovely airport with lots of interesting venues. The Royce chocolate factory is an actuak chocolate production line located inside the international airport terminal which is one of the coolest features I've ever seen at an airport. The airport is a 35 minute train ride from Sapporo station or 1 hour bus/taxi ride to Sapporo city center. The culinary experience was fabulous, and featured a lot of local cuisine. The check in and security process was fast and efficient. The lounge that we were provided- the Royal lounge located in the international sector was newly renovated, spacious, but private at the same time. (The food selection was great too again including lots of local cuisine)"
2249,3658,There are a lot of stores and the customer service is very nice and there are so many stores with toys and very yummy snacks I Nerven tried before.
2250,3659,Very nice airport and it’s is very clean and now too many people and also a lot of cool snacks you can buy
2251,3660,"I'm worried that the security check is lax. The antiperspirant spray that didn't work at New Chitose Airport got stuck at Itami Airport. As a result, I was able to pass through Itami without any problem after showing the package. Security is perfect after you get off. I think it's a good thing that the lines for passengers and those who disembark are separated."
2252,3661,"It was an early morning flight. I thought one of the bento shops and snack shops would be open, but it wasn't open at all. If you have an early morning flight, you will likely have two options: prepare food in advance or eat it at your destination. Many souvenir shops are open. I think it's convenient for buying souvenirs. Also, there are many shops open during the day at this airport, so it's not an inconvenience."
2253,3662,"Baggage claim agents are excellent. They gave us a baggage only 2 minutes after we arrived at the baggage carousel. As I am one of the first passengers who arrived at the baggage claim area, most of the passengers needn't wait at all!! Excellent service, JAL CTS staff!!"
2254,3663,I lost a part of Ticket and had a trouble but a ground agent of ANA tried very hard to help me and finally I could catch a flight without a trouble. Thank you ANA agent at CTS!!
2255,3664,Check-in is at the end of the airport. My pencil case got stuck at the security check.
2256,3665,Many souvenir shop especially seafood is good. Hokkaido original gift can buy there. Clean and tidy airport.
2257,3668,A really small airport. Familymart at the second floor is convenient for some food. A shop run by Mitsukoshi department is good for souvenirs.
2258,3669,International flights counters are under renovation. Taiwan's flag carrier is going to open the TPE-TAK route this March.
2259,3670,"Small but extremely clean and efficient, even the bus into town waits for all passengers - only in Japan."
2260,3671,"Fantastic little airport, spotlessly clean, security a joy, no rubbish on the floor left by kids whose parents can't control them. Toilets probably cleaner than yours AND the loo rolls have the folds you see in hotel rooms."
2261,3673,"Stayed Terminal 3 overnight, well cleaned and lots of shops. JAL Sakura was lounge was great with good food, no time to wait for showering and a lot of seats."
2262,3674,"Brand new built just before the pandemic, re-opened just a few weeks ago, the Terminal 2 international section (for select ANA international flights, 5 of them at the time) felt like a private terminal with no passenger in the security and border control, just staff waiting for us. Massive lounge with just a few people and lots of seats+good view."
2263,3675,"Very helpful airport, security was a breeze to get through. Thought it was a bigger airport, had to use a Bus to get into the arrivals terminal. Baggage claim was a bit slower than usual. Overall happy with the airport."
2264,3676,"The sakura lounge is a little bit crowded, but I really like their food and drinks. I had a bowl of beef curry rice for breakfast, and tried some Japanese Sake."
2265,3677,One of the coffee machine in the first class lounge is unavailable to use. My favorite salmon omusubi disappeared from the food counter. A little disappointed.
2266,3678,Helpful friendly Staff. They helped me to get where I needed to go and get what I needed to get. I enjoyed this experience and I would recommend coming here to everyone.
2267,3679,"I really love Haneda Airport because it is so convenient. Whether it is the convenience from Matsuyama to Haneda, the distance from Haneda to downtown Tokyo, or the number of Haneda routes, it is truly the best airport in Japan."
2268,3680,イミグレと税関はもたもたするな、ボランティアじゃないんだぞ。まじめに働け
2269,3681,"Departs from Haneda Airport 3 terminal. Security check is really bad. It's better than overseas, but it doesn't feel like Japan."
2270,3683,Crew polite. Many restaurants. Fast security. Good check in. Beautiful Airport! Love it so much. Next time will come back.
2271,3684,"Tokyo Narita airport.... One of the best I have been to Lots of Japenese shops, toilets are nice Immigration/Customs/Biosecurity was easy. Lots of food options the day rooms are very helpful I paid 76 AUD for 6 hrs. Nice Airport."
2272,3685,Hated the gate waiting area is one floor below the main terminal. Crowded even during the heights of pandemic. Great JAL Lounge though the wait for shower was too long for my flight.
2273,3686,"Bathrooms were clean, toilets played music, but we somehow got lost easily. Also there was a cool Hello Kitty ad on the tv, and the airport had a nice ambience"
2274,3687,"Narita was extremely clean and fast. Security took maybe 5 minutes total. Exit customs was super easy. The shopping in the terminal was great, but expensive (as airports usually are)."
2275,3688,Japan has somehow managed to create one of the most confusing immigration procedures on this earth - almost as bad as that I experienced in Mozambique. There is far too much bureaucracy involved in the arrival process - bureaucracy and paperwork that could readily be dispatched with.
2276,3689,"getting to the airport is smooth by train or bus. the check-in queue though was way longer than expected, it took us about an hour to check-in our luggage. most food places close at 9pm so given my flight was at 10:30pm I had little time to get something to eat that was not from vending machines."
2277,3690,Expect at least 45 minutes queueing for custom clearance if you are arriving at Terminal 2. Only half of their counters were opened no matter how many passengers arrived the hall.
2278,3691,"I think the only disadvantage is that this airport don’t have any choice of restaurants. There’re only 5 or 6 in Terminal 2, and only 1 café outside the satellite concourse."
2279,3694,"Arrived through the Gama FBO. Was met with a smile as I stepped out of the aircraft. Assistance was provided with my baggage, and I was offered a lift to my destination. Straight through the gate and out to my car. Flawless service"
2280,3695,"Pretty small airport, duty free section is pretty big for the airport but the arrivals area is very small"
2281,3697,"On arrival, impressed with service. Bags in hall in <10 minutes, health and PCR test swiftly done and away. In hotel within 35 minutes of chocks on."
2282,3698,"Everywhere was very clean and well organised, check-in was very fast and the staff were friendly, professional and quick. Security was also fast and the staff were clearly enjoying their job and were friendly and nice to talk to. The lounge area offers amazing views over the apron and the runway. There was a queue to get in the gate, but the staff were very quick and boarding was done in no time."
2283,3699,Upon arriving at Jersey we got off the plane quickly walked along the corridor which was clearly marked Baggage claim. And by the time we reached the carousel it was just starting. By the time I went to the loo and back our luggage was there. Excellent well done Jersey Airport.
2284,3700,Getting better every time I visit. Shame they shut the upstairs viewing gallery though. I like going up there and watching the planes.
2285,3701,"Good airport with plenty of facilities, and excellent viewing area."
2286,3702,"Nice airprot, especially with LED display sying Southend on it."
2287,3703,super
2288,3704,My home country airport. My review may be a bit biased because this is the airport I have used the most.
2289,3705,The airport is nice and all but not a lot of stuff to do while wating but very nice big glass windows to see planes
2290,3706,"We were nearly anxious if we would miss our flight because of a long security check, but because the staff entitled us to a faster security check, we were on time for departure."
2291,3707,"This airport deserved a five star review, but the security screening was terrible. How can you accommodate 1000+ transit passengers with two security checks? I think Amman Airport can improve on that. Putting things aside, Amman Airport has a great architecture."
2292,3708,A Good airport Getting to the airport was kind of a pain The check in officials are very slow There is quite a bit of security But overall the terminal facilities Wi-Fi food pretty good
2293,3709,"The new terminal in AMM is lovely – airy and easily understandable, although it lacks some of the oriental charm of the old one. Regardless, the check-in experience is fine, as are passport and security checks. Fast Track is available for €6.50, which is a good deal. The biggest weakness of this airport is transportation: unless you're very adventurous, an expensive taxi is your only option. This can be frustrating due to long waits at the security checkpoints, and it really detracts from the experience. Food and beverage options are great, although perhaps a more general convenience store is missing – one where you could get a bottle of water and some packaged snacks for the road."
2294,3712,"They took my halva ???????????????, no one ever took my halva!!!!!!!!!! Why? It was never written that you couldn't take halva for 20 dinars on board!!!"
2295,3713,"Airport is about 35kms from Amman so an expensive taxi fare applies = about €25. Security over heavy. Full scan on entering door than full scan after passport control. Even after a ten minute examination of a cheap souvenir bought at a market then cleared by customs, the same souvenir was again over checked after passport control. Too many staff, too little communication between them. Airport however is well appointed with shops and snacks and not far to walk between main entrance and gate. Wifi is patchy"
2296,3714,"The security check must be done twice, when you enter the airport and again when you go to the gate. No further comment."
2297,3716,"This is a cute airport at the south border of Jordan. When I arrived with the taxi, there were 3 people there except me, it was a funny feeling. Also, a soldier let my taxi in the gates, which was also a unique experience coming from Europe."
2298,3717,"The main disadvantage of this airport are long distance to the city and absolutely absent of public transport. Getting to Aktau is possible only by taxi, price is about 8$. Wi-fi in airport is connected with only local SIM."

2304,3729,Ridiculously small boarding area which easily overcrowds - expect to fight for a seat. Very limited food / shopping facilities.
2305,3730,"While entering in Kazakhstan, transit passengers from India are not sure who to deal with the free visa on arrival for Indians who are traveling by Air Astana. Kazakhstan government and Air Astana staffs should be spontaneous and helpful in upcoming days. Facing delays in immigration because of these careless staffs at the airport. Indians beware with all the required documents while traveling via Kazakhstan with Air Astana."
2306,3731,The waiting area for the transfer flights is just a small hall filled with hundreds of people. Very inconvenient
2307,3733,"Small airport, sometimes you need to care your baggage from plane. Small lounge area. There is no public transport from city to airport (or it’s difficult to find it). No public WiFi."
2308,3742,Small and clean KZO airport is located away from the town and it takes 20-25 minutes to get to the town from airport by taxi. Unfortunately there is no bus service-public transport connecting airport with town. There is no Wi-Fi at the airport. There is no gates which can be connected to the airplane so you do not need to get of the plane by walking down the steps and then sit in the bus which will drive you to the airport terminal. There are some minuses however my overall rating is 4 out of 5.
2309,3743,"Small, but isn't bad, a simple airport terminal, all the landed flights are visible from the parking, very interesting procedure to receive the luggage, you have to wait at least 10-20 minuts or more in front of the unique door destinated to treat both passengers and luggage."

2311,3748,"The best airport whenever I've been before. I like the hospitality of the local people. Airport staff also very kind, ready to assist at any time. Industrial issues of airport building at high level. I appreciate. Thank you!!!"
2312,3756,Mombasa is a smaller airport. It's nice to arrive here for the visa que's are not as ernourmous as in Nairobi.
2313,3758,Nice Airport good organised. People working slow there
2314,3759,Nice Airport
2315,3760,Good Airport a bit hot but clean and nice.
2316,3762,"Small domestic terminal, but at least there were lots of seating areas and a couple of food options. Small check in area, and a bit annoying to get to the entrance, but overall, a pleasant experience."
2317,3764,"Staff were rude, especially as we were diplomats. The deplaning process was a bit tedious, and we had to walk outside, even though it was raining. Baggage claim and customs were a mess, and it was very hectic. It felt like there wasn’t any need to put our bags through an X-ray scanner."
2318,3765,Airport makes you go through security on arrival when on a connecting flight which is very unpleasant after a long trip. However it does have some plastic molded reclined seats that help with the layovers. Toilets are leave a lot to be desired in the cleanliness department. WiFi available but its slow. Water was $4 for a 500ml bottle which was absurd.
2319,3766,"Your only option to get to the airport is by road. Back in the day, it was quite a hassle, since traffic was very heavy. It improved drastically with the introduction of the new Expressway. Be prepared for Security Checks where you need to leave the car (unless you're the driver). After entering the terminal, get ready for another security check, this time for all your luggage. Check-In at Kenya Airways is pure chaos since all long their distance flights leave around the same time. Make sure to calculate up to one hour waiting time. However, if you fly with Emirates, the process is much quicker. Security check was better than check-in, usually quite fast. After the long check-in time, there wasn't any time left to check out food and retail services."
2320,3767,"The Immigration process was good, there wasn't a huge queue and I even was allowed to switch to the line for Kenyan citizens, since my wife is Kenyan, which saved additional time. Baggage claim was also alright, however, sometimes the staff clears the baggage claim and puts the luggage somewhere nearby."
2321,3768,"Off the aircraft through the jet bridge, then down a set of stairs onto the apron in front of it, onto a bus to the arrivals hall (which is just a shed) Queue for ages in stuffy conditions to have Visa stamped. Baggage claim area chaotic, staff periodically pull suitcases off belt and put them to one side, so you have to check if it's there or still on the belt. No sort of customs/biosecurity of any kind, no need to declare anything unless it's something valued at 1M Ksh or more. only Hand luggage gets put through xray scanner."
2322,3769,"The security at Jomo Kenyatta airport this night was a monstrosity. There were about 100 people there, and only one security checkpoint open! As soon as we got to the front of the line, only then did they open another one. Disappointing. The terminal was hot and cramped as well."
2323,3770,"Smooth passport control. The terminal is fairly new, and baggage claim was easy and fast. Getting our dog from the cargo terminal was a bit of a challenge, but it worked out in the end."
2324,3771,"A bit of a chaotic check-in procedure (extra security,) and there weren’t a lot of options for food in terminal 1C. The building was new, clean, and modern."
2325,3772,"The private terminal for Safarilink was clean, and modern. Check-in was a breeze, and practically no security. There was also a little coffee shop there too."
2326,3773,"Small, cute, simple and efficient. Nothing much more to say. A lot of interesting planes and helicopters to watch while waiting for your departure to the bush. Has a small cafe shop on the second floor."
2327,3774,a vert simple and effective operation.
2328,3776,The Airport is nice. Its Ok and small. You eassiasly could find your gate and baggage claim.........
2329,3779,"This place is amazing, the airport is bi it has a lot of resturants the WI-FI isnt the best but, thats ok."
2330,3780,It's amazing how functional and pretty the airport this small country has. This is what you would like to see in many airports in European regions.
2331,3781,"Great, very modern easy to navigate little airport. A very pleasant surprise with good food and even a few nice gift shops."
2332,3782,"I used the old terminal and it was perfectly fine, however I can't rate the airport fairly as I haven't used the new building. All I will say is they need to have a good, reliable transport to/from the city as the taxis are very expensive and there seems to be no bus service."
2333,3783,"I was positively surprised by this airport. It seems pretty new. Passport control was a breeze, baggage delivery went pretty fast. Transport to and from the airport is bad, as only (private) taxis are available and those are very expensive. All seems well-organized at this place."
2334,3784,♥
2335,3786,"Kuwait Terminal 1 has seen some renovations for the years. I see new ceilings and renovated bathroom. Since the introduction of T4 for Kuwait Airways and T5 for Jazeera, Kuwait's T1 has seen a ease of congestion over the years."
2336,3788,"The airport is old and outdated. You can enjoy shopping since there are few shops before check in and security, Dasman lounge is pretty decent and offers great food, the entry fee is 12 kwd or around 35$ usd"
2337,3789,We missed our connection due to the first leg being delayed. Airport staff were helpful and professional. We received free airport hotel + transport + breakfast for the new 8hr stopover. LHR-KWI-DXB
2338,3790,Terminal 1 is so obsolete. This terminal comes from the 1980s! Keep in mind that it was before the Iraqi invasion.
2339,3792,"Terminal 1 is obsolete. But, Terminal 4 is quite stupendous. This terminal is designated to Kuwait Airways only."
2340,3794,"It'd very good airport compared to Jeddah. It's not the best still it's good, the staff will be rude, but still it's better than the airports in Saudi Arabia"
2341,3796,"I used VIP lounge in Manas, so I can't rate the terminal. But overall I liked the staff in the VIP lounge, the place is great."
2342,3797,"First time in Manas airport but I liked it. A lot of people in the terminal but it’s ok because the airport is located in Kyrgyzstan’s capital, Bishkek."
2343,3799,"This is an easy airport to use. The building itself is simple so it's hard to get lost but it's also simple in things to do. There are a few restaurants and coffee shops inside. Security is pretty quick and customs is even quicker. Checking in took a while and it seemed unorganized but it works. Coming from Bishkek, it's super easy to get to. It's a straight shot from the city and takes roughly thirty minutes depending on weather and traffic."
2344,3800,Domestic traveling through Bishkek Manas is an absolute breeze. The checkin area is efficient and the staff is adequate at all stages from security till boarding the aircraft.
2345,3803,"Decent aiport for this part of the world. Everything you need to get along, nothing special. Clean ... and services are fast. No funny procedures, no sudden fees. No lounge to speak of, WiFi is free, fast and relyable, all right."
2346,3804,"Getting there: There might or might not be public transport available (Marhsrutki), but let's be honest: a taxi is the straight forward way. From the airport: without pre-arranged transport you will not be able to escape the lounge, hanging around and waiting for their pray - you! 600-700 KGS ... less only if you are really really good. Terminal facilities: decent, basics are covered WiFI: no problem, everywhere, free and fast Food and retail: basics are covered, decent (and rather cheap) duty-free shop - check the spirits ... Kyrgyz Cognac is more than worth its price and still a bargain. 7* could easily sell at tripple the current rate. Lounge: well ... Immigration: usually fast. Baggage claim: Baggages is there before you will be. Check of baggage tags guarantees nobody will take yours."
2347,3805,"The airport is small, but things were very easy. Immigration, although crowded, moved quickly. You do not need to pre-fill out a landing card as it is all done at the desk. The staff were quite friendly. The baggage had arrived at the belt before we got there so it was a simple matter of picking up our bags and walking out to arrivals. The arrivals hall was busy but not uncomfortable. We had a driver booked who we found and were on our way. Bear in mind that the airport is some distance from the city and there appear to be major roadworks going on. There was a 50km/hr speed limit for the entire road, which added 10 minutes or so to the trip to the city. Something to remember for the return journey."
2348,3808,"Small international airport, not busy (in the early morning but probably daylong). Check-in & security are a breeze. Food & retail at the boarding area are good, can pay with cards."
2349,3810,"Getting through immigration is about as easy as can be expected so long as you have the correct $US and a photo. Even if you don't, they're very helpful and will allow you to go to the ATM to get money and will scan your passport for the photo, for an additional nominal fee."
2350,3811,Small international airport with efficient visa on arrival service. Well organized taxi service to town. Dutyfree shopping is very limited and food/drink service in departure hall non existent the day I travelled.
2351,3812,A new airport and much better than Vientiane.
2352,3813,"Functional airport, good considering size of the city. Close to centre."
2353,3814,"VTE is relatively easy to access from downtown Vientiane using hotel cars or taxi. Public transport is a little limited more so if you have plenty of bags. As the airport is small and there are limited check in counters, passengers should arrive about 2 hours prior to departure time. They will not allow most people in before that. So if you arrive too early, you can have coffee or a meal at the food stores/cafes on the second level. These also have Wi-Fi as the supposed free Wi-Fi has too many requirements (mobile number, etc.) that one would rather just use mobile data. There are no airline alliance lounges so there's not much reason why one should arrive early as the pre-departure area is small. However it is fairly clean although the amenities are limited."
2354,3816,Airport near city center and easily reachable by taxi. Small airport with adequate space and efficient security and immigration.
2355,3817,Small airport with only basic but adequate facilities. Visa on arrival and immigration remarkably fast and courteous.
2356,3819,"Small with few facilities but as expected for such a small city. Nice atmosphere in internationals, not so in domestics. Close to city with very friendly staff. Reasonable taxi fares."
2357,3821,The immigration queue
2358,3824,"I liked that the airport is made up of one small terminal and still a pretty busy airport, a problem is because of the busy state its in it can take ages to go thru check-in, it is defiantly better to just use a mobile ticket to get through quicker at the airport, there was a line the size of the check-in area of the airport, but eventually when you get thru the security is very nice and quick, and when passed that there are many restaurants you can check out, places for children and seating areas with chargers, one thing not to do is come in many many hours early, I had encountered some people that had to wait 3 hours extra because of some delays. You will also have bad areas of Wi-Fi."
2359,3825,"Great lounge, lots of amenities such as smoking area, Business lounge, seats, outlets, indoor vaping lounge. great layout overall"
2360,3826,"Please make sure that you get through the passport border at least 1:30hr before the flight otherwise on busy days you can almost miss your flight, I almost missed my flight but made it."
2361,3827,We had a transfer flight from Keflavik to Riga to Tallinn. Very cool airport and small. Liking the Riga airport.
2362,3828,"very easy airport to navigate. Security over within 2 minutes. Lounge in Schengen area is wonderful. Great food, plenty to drink and great apron views"
2363,3829,I had transfer flight Tallinn to Riga To Keflavik. Riga airport was very good and Wifi did not work for my device.
2364,3830,"First time being in Riga airport overrall it as very good airport for transfer fligth to Iceland and Wifi was not good for my device, I did not go loaunge, I did not go Immigrstion and I got baggage on iceland airport."
2365,3831,"Very good warm breakfast in the Lounge in Riga, though a really good breakfast possible. Also everything quite efficient concerning boarding at Riga Airport"
2366,3832,"Beirut raffic Hariri is an amazing airport and I love it, however there are some flaws. Getting into the airport was very smooth. The check in was very easy thanks to the staff but the bags weren’t moving, they were sitting there. The security after the check in was very smooth aswell, however there were long lines. The friendly security made it very quick and easy for everyone to get though quickly. I forgot I had some deodorant in my bag but the security guy let me have one last spray before he took it away. By far the best interaction I have had with a security gaurd. All the food facilities are so good and all the food tastes so delicious and fresh. There is also a wide variety of duty free shops to buy stuff from. At times, the wifi was very slow and would not load at all. Overall Beirut rafic Hariri is a very nice, and modern airport and would definitely recommend it!"
2367,3833,Immigration took a while; about 30 minutes but the guy was quick after then. Airport seemed to be unfortunately not looked after much.
2368,3836,"Im Lebanese so its not the first time that pass by beirut airport, the airport is comfortable and clean but the security lines are messed up when it comes to waiting for security check its trash because i waited 2 hours to get my bags checked beacause lebanese authorities are corrupted they dont want to optimize lines"
2369,3843,Benina Airport is going to be better then before ....still time and work to do. ALL LIBYAN AIRPORTS ARE IN BAD SITUATION... LOOKING FOR BETTER EFFORTS
2370,3844,We are optimistic about the future of Benina international airport (Benghazi) and we hope to see it soon comparable to the major international airports in Europe and America enshaaAllah
2371,3849,:D
2372,3852,so happy that Benina (Benghazi) airport loged into flight radar system like the whole world
2373,3853,The best airport on libya The make it Easier for the passenger to travel And the respect the passengers I like to travel for misratah airport Wifi is good And the check in is great And it's easy
2374,3854,EXCELLENT SERVICES ...........................................................................................
2375,3855,great location taxies avalible atm tickets booking from local airlines offices or travel agencey office restu and cafe real fine security but small bliuding hotels near the airport about 5 km however if you look to the building you will have 4 of10 degree but if look for the things like services location lounge immigration customs
2376,3861,>>>>>>>>>>>>>So Cool>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
2377,3869,ok
2378,3871,"Rude staff.. make you feel as welcome as a dose of covid. very unhelpful, aggressive and bad mannered. Access to the plane is ridiculous!! The planes are parked at least 500 feet from the terminal and difficult metal steps to navigate. No seating after check in so you could be standing hours, a few disabled seats but thats it. Horrible airport. Vile staff."
2379,3872,Kaunas is a small airport with rarely more than a dozen or so flights per day but it works. Delays are only experienced when incoming aircraft are late.
2380,3873,"My flight was delayed, and I knew that through FlightRadar when I was still home. However, the airport didn't show the delay on screens, so many people were waiting near gates, expecting to be boarded, and were shocked when fellow passenger told them about the delay."
2381,3874,"Small but modern and reliable, very fast checks. Easy to commute with the city, only 6 mi from the city center."
2382,3875,"Kaunas Oro Uostas a small but modern international airport. It is situated a 15-minute drive from the city. We arrived at the airport an hour before landing, so I have been registered, and then found a cafe and had breakfast before departure. We are all in this airport was pleasant and high-quality vayfay, there are several restaurants and shops Duty Freya. Photos from this airport in my blog drevilo.com"
2383,3876,"I USE THIS AIRPORT TWICE PER MONTH EVERY MONTH AND FIND IT SMALL BUT A GOOD AIRPORT. CERTAINLY ADEQUATE FOR THE VOLUME OF TRAFFIC AS ON;Y RYANAIR OPERATES SCHEDULED PASSENGER SERVICES. SECURITY COULD BE MORE ORGANISED BUT IS STRICT. THE LACK OF SHOPS IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR ME. UNLIKE ANOTHER REVIEWER, KOEN, I DISPUTE HIS CLAIM THAT TOILETS WERE DIRTY WITH RUSTY SINKS ; THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT TRUE AS THE TERMINAL IS FAIRLY NEW."
2384,3878,"It's a small but good and modern airport. It has everything it needs, few shops, few cafeterias, etc. There are never annoying queues as in other bigger airports. The connection to the city is very good, you can take a taxi or go by bus. The staff is quite strict so be prepared for a good check up."
2385,3879,"Very good, and very well designed airport. There aren't many shops, but that is not a problem for me. The airport is very cosy and staff is quite friendly. No problem at all for me. Had a nice time there. I wish to go back to Kaunas Airport."
2386,3880,Good airport
2387,3881,"It wasn't at all too bad. Getting to the airport was alright, although a bit too expensive in my opinion. There was free WiFi, but it wasn't the best; as it was quite slow. There was no shops except for a small café near the check-in desk. There wasn't any lounges, but a few metal chairs that I found very uncomfortable. Getting my bag back was incredibly quick."
2388,3883,Nice small regional airport.
2389,3885,It is really efficient at Vilnius if you arrive. After you reach the terminal there are only a few meters and you are out of the building!
2390,3886,"Excellent Lounge, no one basically using the fast track, plenty of things to buy in the duty free shop and other restaurants."
2391,3887,"Small airport, not very busy. Quick check in and quick security check. For some odd reason some tax free articles were not available to travellers within EU."
2392,3888,When you walk out of the airport look to your right and you will see a bus shelter. The 3G bus stops here and costs one euro single into the city centre on its north side by the river. The return stop is facing. Fast regular and way cheaper than a taxi.
2393,3889,"Arriving at this rahter smal airporte is quite comfortable, fast disamebarkment and short ways. However there arent any food and retails on the way to baggab claim/exit."
2394,3890,World's best airport. Absolutely amazing. More flights should come and go through Vilnius to the US or UK.
2395,3892,Small airport and had to mark down during Covid as nothing was really open internally. Very limited for food and beverage. Getting to the airport though was very easy and public transport to the door.
2396,3894,"Priority bags…. Are never treated in Priority in LUX at least on the OPO LUX service, whether LG or TP operated flights!"
2397,3895,"I was initially ver impressed with the small but concise airport. The security check was super speedy. However, there was only one passport booth open for multiple non-Schengen flights, leading to around half an hour of queuing as the eGates were also closed. Upon boarding we were put on the wrong bus, so had to get off again and wait for another bus."
2398,3896,"A small pleasant airport in the city. Good lounge, but uncomfortable navigation - is difficult to find this lounge at the airport"
2399,3897,"Brilliant little airport, super quick and efficient to use, and with Luxembourg's free public transport, couldn't be easier to get to."
2400,3898,"Small airport, of sufficient standard to serve the country. Relatively easy to access the city center."
2401,3899,"Getting to the airport - Five Stars out of five. (By public transport, it takes less than 10 minutes. In a country where all, absolutely all public transport is free of charge.) Connecting to WiFi - I would give a Hundred Stars. Super easy - you click on ""accept"", click on ""connect"", and it works! (No need to fill in your personal data, or email or other credentials)."
2402,3900,"No lounge, despite a ticket, because LH canceled the Luxair Lounge. There's a complaint here too"
2403,3901,This airport has a serious issue on how to handle properly priority bags. This was the case pre covid and carries on identical mow even with the ridiculously low no of flights!!! Today mine were LAST!!!
2404,3902,"Very easy to get to, especially using the 16 bus. The lounge (one for all airlines) is comfortable, but the food choices are very poor - nothing warm. Not much to do at this small airport, so don't go too early."
2405,3903,"Really small, a bit too much, but nice, well kept and modern. It was really clear we couldn't access most of it, more so than most airports"
2406,3904,"The Airport was clean, small and easy to move around. The terminal has some dirty windows but provides some great angles for any spotters who are waiting to kill some time. There weren't too much shops and restaurants but I don't really mind. Overall it's a nice airport."
2407,3905,Getting to the airport is easy. There were buses waiting for the passengers at the airport. I later learnt that the buses also provide WiFi. which is great. The terminal was clean and the WiFi was fast. Immigration and customs was quite fast. Baggage claim was also quite fast too.
2408,3906,"The Airport was clean, small and easy to move around. The terminal has some dirty windows but provides some great angles for any spotters who are waiting to kill some time. There weren't too much shops and restaurants but I don't really mind. Overall it's a nice airport."
2409,3908,there are lots of people at the check-in counter at around 6 am. there is improvement in staffs' efficiency in order to reduce the time passengers spending at there
2410,3909,"A cozy airport with all the facilities, even cold and hot water for drinking. Exchange on every floor, so if you forget to change your MOP$ when you pass the security, you can still do it before boarding. Very quick boarding."
2411,3910,"Limited food and duty-free choices in the departure hall. Food is pretty expensive and portion is miserly. But, still, a better option than buying food from the airline (budget airline, that is) as you get more legit food."
2412,3911,"It's hard to get there via public transport (there's small buses that often overcrowded), thus taxi's better choice (around 80 MOP for a ride). The airport itself usual, nothing special to remember. It have runway on the sea side, looks great."
2413,3912,"It's, hard to get to the airport from the city"
2414,3925,Pretty decent airport for a rather small place. More selection of restaurants than expected for certain
2415,3927,"nice airport-clean, easy to explore and friendly for traveler. signage was clear and direction to my gate for departure. the baggage claim take so long up until 30 minutes could be because of many flight landed at the same time. Immigration and customs quiet fast and friendly staff."
2416,3931,Not bad at all. For some reason the AirAsia check-in desk was very insistent on me having an outbound flight before I go through security so I bought an impromptu flight to Saigon in a couple days.
2417,3933,The airport itself is very user friendly for domestic and international. The drop off-pick up parking space need to be more managed
2418,3934,"BKI has a taxi desk where taxis to the city can be booked for a flat fare. Arriving in Sabah from Sarawak requires clearing immigration, but it is not a problem."
2419,3935,BKI is straightforward to get to. It is not too far from the city. It is pretty easy and stress free to transit.
2420,3936,"It was easy to print the boarding pass and bag tag at the Kiosk, and during the drop luggage, the staff were accommodating. Security check was smooth as long as you guys follow the procedure. The departure hall was spacious, and the announcement was clear. All in all, it was a superb experience for me."
2421,3937,"a lot improvement in check-area level 3-departures. much more open space rather than boxes of glasses panel. need improvement on toilet facilities. make it more modern. overall, i'm satisfy."
2422,3938,"It's a nice airport, however, security is the most annoying thing ever. Before boarding the plane we went through three security checks and the checks are really basic as well. I don't see how that makes sense. Also, apparently there was good wifi there but I failed to connect on the sign-in website. All in all a pretty average airport."
2423,3939,"Perfect fish market in the evening. But everywhere a lot of rats in the evening. During Sundays market in streets of Kota Kinabalu - good place to buy souveniers. Try hotel Mandarin - friendly staff, clean and perfect located place for your living."
2424,3940,"This is for the Low cost terminal in Kota Kinabalu (where Airasia flies in and out of). Nothing much to do in the airport. Nothing to eat or buy. Best to go with no expectations whatsoever although generally speaking if you are departing KK, the immigration lines are quite short. Its the other way round if you are getting into KK. Once the immigration line was so long the small room meant for immigration was not enough to contain it and people had to queue outdoors."
2425,3941,"It's been too long. What do you check twice? Once you check your passport and go to customs, once you go duty free and then check in =)))))) Then check in at the counter and be charged 30 ringgit per person."
2426,3942,"Limited restaurant on airside main terminal KLIA1, have to cross to satellite terminal in order to get more choices. But the aerotrain is out of service and I'm too lazy to use bus"
2427,3946,"Friendly staff, free deriking water, good wifi, security check quick and nice. A good place even if you need to sleep here on the floor."
2428,3947,CLEAN TOILET GOOD WALKWAY GOOD VIEW OF PLANES GOOD GATE GOT AIR FILTER SO I DONT GET COVID GOT GOOD WATER DISPENSER GOOOD WIFI ALSO
2429,3948,"There are few duty free shops. It was nice to be able to check in and leave luggage at Kuala Central Station, and access by train. For some reason, the security check when boarding is in front of the boarding gate. Malaysia Airlines Golden Lounge isn't bad."
2430,3949,"This is my home airport, I've been here a lot. The Airport isn't bad. Unfortunately, the Airport is a 1hr drive from the city (Kuala Lumpur). You can go by Train but it's quite expensive (compared to other Airports). Free unlimited wifi, security is at the gate, Airport staff is nice."
2431,3950,"Kuala Lumpur KLIA2 is great with convenient and easy transfers, good facilities and helpful staff. You can easily make a 45min connection here. Terminal 1 is also good but a little bit weird as they use the same area for arrivals and departures. Many plane models are also on display in Terminal 1."
2432,3951,"Prices for food are just as cheap as in the city, quick check-in and Siko, but after Siko there is hardly any choice of food, etc."
2433,3952,A cute regional airport. Compact and bijou with very unstressed and friendly staff. Well worth travelling through this airport for a reminder of how air travel used to be.
2434,3953,"Cosy, simple airport. The best thing about Subang airport is how close it is to the city centre. Despite being a cosy airport, it is run-down at the same time."
2435,3954,SZB was a little run down even then having been replaced as the main airport by KUL. There were still some internal MH flights using the airport. The airport was very quiet at the time and passing through was very simple. The best thing about Subang was the closeness to the city centre and the ease of getting to the airport.
2436,3955,nice and quiet
2437,3958,"Cosy, not very accessible by public transport."
2438,3962,"Be wary of traveling internationally from Kuching. Find out which terminal you depart from before arriving at the airport. We got there, proceeded through security and passport control, only to find out that there were no restaurants or even take-away chains in that portion of the terminal."
2439,3963,Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysian Borneo are special regions and all arrivals have to pass through immigration. It is not issue and the queues never seem to be too long. KCH has a taxi where passengers can book a taxi for a set price to the city.
2440,3964,"I had a good experience during all of my travels through KCH. It is a relatively cheap taxi journey to the airport from the city. The airport reminded me of the golden age of flying for me. I experienced none of the stress that I normally experience transiting an airport, particularly security."
2441,3965,Small international airport. Usual traffic congestion caused by indiscriminate parking in no parking areas. AirAsia self service counter was great. Fast and efficient
2442,3966,Small international airport that serves its purpose. Traffic control outside airport is bad with indiscriminate parking and lack of enforcement
2443,3967,A slightly aging airport buuilt by the British. Facullites are limited but I found the airport clean and efficient.
2444,3968,"Small airport in Sarawak, easily accessible by Grab from the city centre. There are some food options and drink options and the prices seem fair. The immigration and check-in went all right. 3 stars here means it's pretty average and hassle-free and it gives you what you need, but there's nothing wow about the place."
2445,3970,KLIA BIG AIRPORTS AT MALAYSIA AND BUSIEST AIRPORT TOO THIS AIRORT IS HAS A TERMINAL TRAIN MRT FROM THE CITY SO THE GETTING TO THE AIRPORT IS EXCELLENCE MALAYSIA IS BIG COUNTRY AND KLIA MAKE MALAYSIA ECONOMICS INCREASED
2446,3971,"a small, beautiful international airport. the place is cozy and not so crowded. check in procedure, baggage handling are good, but the immigration is a little bit lame. the immigration officer works like she haven't eat for years"
2447,3973,"Langkawi is a nice airport as it's small but it has everything you will need. After security, you will have 3 shops where you can buy food and drinks."
2448,3974,+ Relaxed arrival by taxi for little money + No waiting times at the security check + Toilets available everywhere - somewhat outdated airport
2449,3975,"+ Fast delivery of luggage + Clear airport, everything can be found quickly + Many taxis at a bargain price - long waiting times before immigration"
2450,3977,"Hardly any restaurants. Airport was quite clean apart from toilets. Wifi worked well. Security is reasonably quick, but when numerous flights are departing at the same time it can get quite packed. Virtually no food options though, only major downside."
2451,3978,"beautiful island with humble society. not so crowded. the airport is ok. the transportation such as taxi is pretty hard to find in dawn, so you have to becareful if you're planning to fly in the very first flight in the morning. it could ended up you're late because of the taxi"
2452,3979,small and cozy airport. you can easily book your (half/)day trip at the airport(even it's price is as same as other agencies in Chenang beach or Kuah Jetty!). it is really convenient. and staffs are so kind.
2453,3980,"cute, small it starts November 2013 12 planes per day, I'm curious to see how that changes!"
2454,3981,Small and nice airport with bare minimum arrangements.
2455,3984,"Arriving in MYY on a MASWings flight is straightforward. I just passed through the airport without any problems. I had no hold baggage so it was simply a case of get of the plane, pass straight through arrivals and straight to the taxi desk."
2456,3985,"MYY is a little out from the city, but it is pretty much a straight road and a relatively cheap taxi ride away. Security is problem free and quick to pass through."
2457,3986,"Small airport in Sarawak. Very efficient; arrived on an inter-Sarawak flight (so no immigration at all), and total duration from landing to being at the taxi rank was probably less than 5 minutes. Didn't depart from here so can't comment on lounge facilities, etc."
2458,3987,+ Modern and surprisingly efficient airport + Suitcases arrive quickly + Well connected by buses and taxis - nothing to criticize
2459,3988,"Small airport with really efficient check in and security, only took about 10 mims form kerb to gate!"
2460,3989,"The airport is OK, although the facilities remain a little bit limited. Especially if coming in a little bit early and unable to check in and go through security and immigration, there are not that many option for food and waiting... But all in all, the airport is still convenient and OK."
2461,3993,Beautiful as the airport is almost complete its renovation
2462,3995,"Airport under renovation, hence a bit of a mess. But should looks good once it is completed"
2463,4000,The terminal is quite small so it only takes some handful minutes for you to go through from the check-in counter to the gate.
2464,4001,"a slight improvement since last few years (im frequent to this airport) a new toilet face-let in departure and arrive, a new gate for AirAsia and more shops, but still immigration queue for departing quite long considering only 2 flight during 10.00 am"
2465,4002,dive
2466,4007,1. Getting to and from from the airport should not be a problem since it is organised by the individual resorts. 2. Immigration and customs is quick and fast. 3. Wifi is non-existent. 4. You have the usual food options of Bugger King and Pizza. Nothing exotic.
2467,4008,Single Runway with No taxiway (i am writing this in 2021) the palnes need to backtrack wich may cause delays in flight. most of the flights have to go into holding before landing.
2468,4012,Male is an airport that is not particularly large and has beautiful views over the sea. But there are only bus gates.
2469,4013,Very unorganized security work on the check-in. We waited about 45 minutes to reach the terminal!!!!
2470,4015,Small and simple airport but well organised. Just enough shops and places to eat. Nice Business lounge for THY.
2471,4016,"Very quick check-in, very quick security check and beautiful lounge. The airport is very compact for its size, but offers countless possibilities. Really very positively surprised."
2472,4017,Generally I liked the airport. There were too little sockets I guess. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
2473,4018,Through security which was quick and efficient but sending every flight to passport control at the same time caused grid lock and took forever to reach the gate.
2474,4019,"The airport is very easy to reach by public transport. Check-in was quick, as was security. I really liked the lounge. Nice design, modern and very clean. There is also a terrace and a great view of the apron."
2475,4020,"It was funny that on arrival to Malta we got on the bus at a nice bus stop near the airpot. On departure, the same bus dropped us on the road with no pedestrian cross :-) I think there could be a little more comfort at that point, but OK. We crossed the road and after a couple of minutes walking side by side with huge trucks we were there. The airport was crowded with few places to sit. However, everything went right. Water cost 2.06 euros and Coke 3 euros."
2476,4021,Clean and nice airport. Although it doesn't offer many options to eat after you've passed the security. Gates are easy to find.
2477,4022,Very nice small Airport. But if you didnt can go in to the lounge. It would be very boring. But from entering the airport to the gate goes very fast
2478,4023,"Airport already evaluated previously. Very good and with excellent services for passengers, as well as easy and quick bus connections to the center of Valletta."
2479,4024,Malta Airport is small but extremely functional. Easy access to the city center by bus. Airport well signposted and with a good lounge.
2480,4025,I was lucky enough to arrive before a lot of other passengers so check-in and security was quick and easy. The terminal subsequently filled up quickly and was grateful to have lounge access as the communal spaces became very full. The lounge is great. The staff were fantastic and the viewing terrace is excellent.
2481,4026,"Nice airport, everything goes by smoothly, although the terminal is not very clean. Windows, bathrooms are dirty, and food and stores past security aren't well organized."
2482,4027,The road leaving the airport is still overcrowded and the baggage claim areas have become too small to accommodate all the passengers of an A350K. No customs control even if they are present.
2483,4028,"Very nice airport, with flights going to Guadeloupe, metropolitan France (Orly and CDG), cool airport with some shops and a great view of the runway, when you must wait your flight, it's cool to see other planes !"
2484,4029,"Very busy, not enough seating, lounge full so mot possible to use, general melee at boarding - passengers did not appreciate the boarding system"
2485,4033,"Overall it was ok, it was the best thing ever when we had just had our 13 hour flight and got gifted a Cold towel and a ice cold bottle of water"
2486,4034,Controlling covid measures takes a lot of time.....Lost two hours at border control
2487,4035,"I live here so getting to the airport is not a problem, check-in was done online before hand and baggage drop-in was done smoothly. Facilities are great, WiFi, food ventures albeit a bit pricy but the quality of the food is good."
2488,4036,The airport is a small one and baggage claim takes a really long time. The way to the gate is quite straightforward.
2489,4037,It's quite a small airport and very long queues. The shops are fantastic and reaching to the gate was easy.
2490,4038,"Organized departure. In immigration there are two lines, that of police control and that of health control. It seemed like they were going to ask us to show our return ticket (I was watching it with other tourists), but in the end the entrance was calm with friendly staff. At the health check they only asked us for the completed form and asked us when was the last time we traveled to Brazil. They did not ask for a vaccination certificate."
2491,4039,New airport facilities with quick Luggage service. Perfect and fast Free WLAN connection. If you need to change Money do it at the airport as you’ll get the best rate in Mauritius.
2492,4040,"Exceed my expectaction, was a elegant airpor the check in was easy and fast, the lounge near the exits gate were in mochette and i think that give to paasenger a sense of home because red is the color of the flag's company."
2493,4041,"Frankfurt Am Main Airport, one of the most advance and busiest european airport. Had a nice experience. However, Condor flight was water leaking from air conditioning system. Food quality was average. In flight service was below average."
2494,4045,Terminal 3 is in need of expansion. Its very crowded. Lines are long at arrival/immigration because of numerous jets landing around the same time. Long lines also to get through security. Seating at the gates is at a premium due to the large number of passengers. WiFi is spotty and non-existent. Unable to browse using mobile phone signal. There are 2 lounges but only one is airside - Plaza Premium Lounge
2495,4047,"Check in was good. Security was good and fast enough. Food was expensive. Airport had no wifi (some very unreliable wifi networks did exist, but they only allowed limited websites to load, not including flightradar24. I didn't try the lounge."
2496,4048,"Terminal was modern and new, but the Immigration (not customs) line was very, very busy with multiple wide body jets arriving at the same time. The queue was poorly organized, and only 3 or 4 out of 10 customs booths were open (E gates were a bit less busy and half were working). However, customs went very well and quickly."
2497,4049,"The Airport is near of some hotels,but very far from Ciudad del Carmen.The terminal facilities were good and the food and retail services are very vast in the Airport."
2498,4050,Hung out in the American Express Platinum Card lounge prior to my flight. Relaxing with Good food and drinks.
2499,4051,"Used the NEW ""E"" lines to get through the Immigration line. It was slow moving with help of a tech. They only have 3 of these lanes"
2500,4053,"The Cancun airport isn't expansive, and it lacks a lot of theming considering it's location. There are no windows and it's almost sloppy, but exiting the facility, you get a woosh of tropical air and heat and it's all worth the surprise. Be careful of getting sketchy cabs to your resort, however."
2501,4054,"The airport is since its renovation very pleasant. Modern, clean, big enough... I like it very much. For me, the best small airport that I know!"
2502,4059,"There is a transportation chaos to get there, but I found the airport to have good shop and food, good staff (in my experience) and an overall good terminal"
2503,4060,"A airport that is prepared to receive Long haul flights,altough it has their flaws like the check in zone,the other buildings like the Main terminal and the retail zone are very modern.Also the security zone is fast and the flight departe on time,which is normally not seen at Mexico's city.Overrall a prospect airport."
2504,4061,Guadalajara Airport is one of the growing hubs on the mexican airspace and airlines like Aeromexico have established foreign destinations to countries like the U.S and Spain and due to this the terminals of the airport are big and with a lot of places to eat and shop while you are waiting your flight.
2505,4062,They are remodeling the airport which was much needed. They best part about the airport is the VIP entrance to the Priority Pass Lounge when arriving to the airport. Once completed thia airport will be nice
2506,4063,"Right now the whole airport has a large mosquito problem. While arriving and departing, be prepared to be greeted by this and use proper bug repellant so you don’t get bit. Customs when arriving and check-in while departing isn’t too bad as a whole. The agents are very effective in processing people through."
2507,4064,"Guadalajara International Airport is the third busiest airport in Mexico, only after Mexico City International Airport and Cancún International Airport, and the second busiest for air cargo flights. It is made up of two landing strips and two terminals. It has flights to various places in Mexico, Central America and the United States. He was called Miguel Hidalgo, in honor of the hero of Mexican Independence. It is located 17 kilometers south of the city of Guadalajara, Jalisco, on the Guadalajara-Chapala highway."
2508,4065,"Guadalajara may be a small airport but it has good amenities. It now looks modern! Getting to the airport is not difficult although at the moment some construction is going on near the drop-off areas. Otherwise, everything went smooth."
2509,4066,Guadalajara Airport is a very nice airport with quite some people which is not yet bothersome. A very modern airport that makes flying a very nice experience and has a number of shops and restaurants even in a not-so-big airport.
2510,4067,The airport looks very modern and new which creates a very calm environment. Everything that I experienced was really good and the immigration/customs line went by fast.
2511,4068,"Very Nice airport ! One of the best of mexico, very nice attention, its very beautiful from the outside and inside the airport, its clean and has a really cool view of the runways... awesome. The weather also is very cool its never so cold or too hot, its the birthplace of all mexican traditions (Tequila, Mariachi, Charreria)"
2512,4069,"The most beautiful airport I know, very well maintained, clean, the people are very friendly and helpful. With few flights and very flirtatious."
2513,4070,Beautiful small airport I loved how the terminal roof is covered with palm leaves. People are super nice. Airport taxi is expensive (480 pesos one way private taxi). Just buy one way trip private taxi) on your way back take a regular taxi for 250 Pesos. There is also a shuttle option out of the airport for about 160 pesos per person (Multiple stops).
2514,4071,"It´s a very peculiar airport but its facilities are excellent. The staff at the airport and the shops (duty free, etc) are incredible and very friendly"
2515,4072,"Great shuttle service with oscartourguide@gmail.com. He is professional, reliable, reasonable, and bilingual. Will book him Everytime. Thank you Oscar Velasquez."
2516,4073,No public transportation but taxi (expensive). More strict at security check than other major airports within Mexico. Magnificent structure.
2517,4083,"MEX is a mad house. It seems to have been built up over the years without any real thought about the passenger experience. Travelling to the airport at first seems easy. It is served by the Mexico City underground system. After getting off of the train, things go awry. The route to the terminal building is not clearly marked and the people that I asked gave contradictory advice. Some of the alternatives that I was given required dragging a case over terrain that a case really shouldn't be going. Or requiring carrying my case up stairs in the heat and high altitude. I ended up flagging a taxi as I was going round in circles. An annoyance in the airport is that in every toilet there is a man expecting a tip for handing users paper towels. Otherwise, passing through the airport is not too difficult."
2518,4084,"A bit of a confusing airport, only assigned gate 15 minutes before boarding so spent a hour trying to figure where to go."
2519,4086,"The airport is crowded, be prepared for walk a lot. For my case (arriving in a domestic flight and leaving in an international flight) it was not necessary to get through the security check nor the immigration, but my boarding was delayed because some documents had to be checked in the line to enter the aircraft."
2520,4087,"If you use the Mexico City's Terminal 1 (not Aeroméxico's), pay attention if you have short connections, since the gate you arrive may be too far to the gate you'll leave."
2521,4088,"El metro, the subway system of the Ciudad de México, works pretty well, as though it is really crowded, but it stops right in front at the airport. The security was fighting with themselves because of the line size and it delayed our security check. The lounge was also not good, since there were paid and free products, and the staff controlled the amount of free products we could have."
2522,4089,"The terminal after arrivals are very crowded, especially if you have connections. The Terminal 1 is extremely long and if your gate is numerically far away than which you are, be prepared to walk. The public WiFi worked really well."
2523,4090,"An airport that lacks maintenance, thanks to the restrictive economic plan and tricks of President López Obrador."
2524,4092,"For the ones who know the airport, it is easy to walk, but it may confuse first-time travellers. Immigration was fast, but it could be faster, since there were some security issues (such as possible illegal immigration issues) with people right in front of me. Since there aren't many international flights to Monterrey Airport, immigration use to not be an issue out there. Be aware to not confuse domestic and international baggage claim though, since there are no separation on Terminal A."
2525,4093,"Pay attention if you have VivaAerobus flights leaving Terminal A. They may not be displayed on screens. This is because, even if your boarding pass says it will leave Terminal A, you may need to get a bus (called Aerotrén, even though it is not a train) to an annex (which I believe is Terminal C) on Gate 12."
2526,4094,"The Terminal A for arrivals is not the easier to understand, since there is some lack of signs. Also, the WiFi doesn't work that well and the baggage claim is within a long aisle, you have to walk a lot to it. Also, for connecting passengers, they must pass into security check again and flow of passengers arriving and departing the airport may get confused in some busy hours."
2527,4095,"Monterrey Terminal A is under restauration, but it does not interfere with the passenger flow. Even though the ticket said our terminal was the Terminal A, our plane left the brand new Terminal C. Luckly, there were buses after security area that left us on the right terminal. Although, there were no stores available, since they were all closed at near 6am."
2528,4096,"Although the Monterrey Airport is in a renovation process, the Terminal 2 is extremely well organized. There were some line to exit the airplane due to a police operation that was checking everyone's ID/Passport thoroughly. The long aisle between the airplane gate and the baggage claim without treadmill is exausting. Lines were also formed in the shuffle to externals parking lots, which were not well signed."
2529,4099,"On the early beginning of the quarantine, the airport terminal was completely empty and all stores were closed. Security officers were helpful and kind."
2530,4100,"Missed information about the airline and guided me to the wrong terminal. Although only one check-in desk was available for Magnicharters, it did not took long for it to be done. You shall have any kind of internet connection to fill the covid prevention form, but the airport's free WiFi did not work well. After the check, domestic and international flights were side by side, without any division nor immigration offices, which is not usual. Hence, a very spacious, luminous and bright terminal."
2531,4101,"VivAerobus has its own terminal, really small but very appropriate to an ultra low cost airline. Although other terminals are better, don't expect much on this one. Free wifi was available and necessary for filling Covid protocols (paper ones were not available), but it didn't work. Didn't try any food service but it seemed pretty well served for such a small terminal."
2532,4102,"Small regional with some international flights, clean restrooms and semi friendly staff, food options there's some coffee shops and a restaurant, airport around 1hr from the city center, uber is a great option to getting there."
2533,4103,Good small cozy airport. Only issue i had was that when i got to the baggage claim on arrival the suitcases were on the wrong baggage line.
2534,4104,"Small and not many food/drink options. However, I did like the renovations at the airport. Hopefully, we will see some new airlines like Delta or Alaska at the airport soon!"
2535,4111,The gauntlet of timeshare sellers is daunting. Keep your head down and plow through them until you’re outside.
2536,4112,Puerto Vallarta International Airport is a very chill airport. Nice bathrooms and lots of options to eat.
2537,4113,"When the airport gets crowded, things get very slow and inconvenient. The WiFi there is very spotty, it is difficult to get around, especially if your gate is closer to 20 than 1, and when multiple airplanes are moving, it can take up to 20-25 minutes for your airplane to get going."
2538,4114,To be honest PVR is still an old airport with a few add ons. It depends on the time that your flight departs that it will be an OK airport or it will be hell
2539,4115,Very slow on baggage. Not very good with special assistance if you dont rely on a chair. Excessive queues. 1.5 hours to get out airport.
2540,4116,"Its bigger than you think this airport, lots of duty free and places to eat and drink. Air con working in the departure hall but not in the baggage reclaim and immigration and customs. The airport it's self is very easy to get to from any location and taxis are cheap enough. All coaches, buses and taxis wait outside the terminal building. If flying with Thomson reps wait outside. do not approach anyone inside pretending to be a rep"
2541,4117,"It´s always efficient, people is willing to help if you need something, check-in without any problem, decent security check, no need to remove shoes. A/C working at all times. And there are more remote gates than jetbridges."
2542,4118,"The Airport is very far from the city centre and the check in was slow.But,the facilities were good,although more food and retail services are needed.Otherwise is a decent airport with some improvements to be needed."
2543,4119,Small Airport that operate Flights to the United States and some Cities in Mexico that is modern and that has a check in that is a bit Long but otherwise is a good small airport with fast Wi-Fi.But the only problem is that is far from the city and that it has to need more retail Shops.
2544,4120,Please review if airport Taxi is cheaper than UBER since uber dynamic rate is working unpropertly in this destination due lack of trips
2545,4121,The airport is 35km away from the city and there is nonpublic transportation is a very small airport but very traveler friendly
2546,4123,"The airport is functional, since August 2019 they are making modifications to the structure. The security team are very friendly and the staff is available to resolve any problem."
2547,4125,There are a lot of people offering you taxis and all sorts of things. Plan transportation ahead of time and IGNORE all the people asking you things.
2548,4129,"Smaller airport with a recent addition (within the last 2 years), and about 5 or 6 fast food choices. Small news stand type market, as well. Comfortable seating in front of large windows. No wifi. There always seems to be a long line at customs and immigration. I'm not sure if that's due to how the planes are scheduled, or inefficiency of the airport."
2549,4130,Great Wx and Golf in the winter... Make sure you visit the city of San Jose
2550,4131,"Is at 2 hours of Queretaro and 4 hours of Mexico city is a bit small but operates domestic flights to parts of Mexico like Mexico City,Tijuana or Cancun (all this operated by Aeromexico connect and volaris) and international flights to USA parts like Houston (operated by united),Los Angeles (operated by Volaris and Aeromexico connect) and Chicago (operated by Volaris)."
2551,4132,"Nice small airport, easy to access, quick arrival, quick departure. Don't expect a lot of services, but all the basic needs are well met."
2552,4133,"The airport is small, the Internet service once you get through security is slow, and of course you must have an Infinitum account. Once you pass security there is only one bar where you can consume or eat something quickly, there are really no services in the sterile area."
2553,4137,"For a regional airport everything it needs. It is kind of far from bigger cities like tuxtla. You can rent a dar here. Do it with America Car Rental. Thy do not try to scam you, like mas/mex. Best expierience so far with reasonable cost."
2554,4138,"The only thing I didn't like was how those who take the luggage from the carts onto the belts throw the luggage, but I give them a thumbs up..."
2555,4139,"At the time I was there, it had rained very hard, therefore, there were delays in arrivals and departures, however, it seemed that the airport only operated with emergency lights, it was very hot and unbearable (even inside the small room vip), I think it was also so that the air conditioning would work. The staff in general was friendly, the toilets were very clean."
2556,4140,"The attention of the airline managers during boarding was excellent, they were attentive all the time and we were informed about the enormous delay we had as we were going at all times..."
2557,4141,"The attention of the airline managers during boarding was excellent, they were attentive all the time and we were informed about the enormous delay we had as we were going at all times..."
2558,4146,"still has the oudated checking in with tickets that you need to get at a counter with the passport, the food isn't too expensive (relative to other airports), the announcers' English could be better"
2559,4147,Everything is speedy. I can take a bus within 20 minutes after arrival the terminal including baggage claim and exchange money and get a sim card!
2560,4148,"Relatively small, pleasant, modern airport."
2561,4149,"This is my hometown airport. The only thing I don't like is that it's missing a panorama terrace. Other than that, it's very clean and the recent renovation looks great."
2562,4150,"A really modern and well decorated airport, although it is very small and doesn't have so much to do. I will give it the benefit of the doubt that it is still a growing airport, serving a smaller city of population 700,000."
2563,4151,"Very good internet connection, the bus from the airport is quite slow and it departs only 2 times each hour. One exchange office in the airport has quite good rates."
2564,4152,Chisinau International Airport is undergoing major reconstruction and building at the moment. On arrival you feel you are in a Construction zone but you don't stay there for long.
2565,4155,"Interesting airport, lots of stored Russian built airliners. Did the job."
2566,4159,"ULN is now very nice and waiting for a flight is not so terrible was before. Well renovated, wifi was ok."
2567,4160,"Small airport, but very clean and nice once you get to the airside. Close to the city thus easy to reach. Check-in does not accept digital/printed boarding cards, queue on counter compulsory (unfortunately). Public WiFi ok, but signal varies strongly depending on your location at the airport."
2568,4161,"ULN is the best int'l airport in Mongolia. as there are few int'l flights per day, facilities are not modern."
2569,4163,"Small airport that can get really messy in season. Flying in December made my experience pretty good. There is no public transport going directly to the airport! You have to take train from Podgorica station (or any other station on the Podgorica - Bar line) to station Aerodrom from where you have to walk like 10-15 minutes to the airport. Printing boarding pass may help but they accepted my mobile pass as well. I was told I can use it at the check in. Make sure to get some snacks in case you like to eat before flight. There is just one cafe bar :) Duty free is small but offers pretty much good deals. Alcohol is average. Cigarettes are €31,50 for Marlboro or some unknown brand cigarettes for €12,50. Overall it was convinient experience. 3/5⭐️"
2570,4164,"the airport does not accept mobile cards and ticket printouts. Before the passports are checked, they send us to the baggage drop point to issue us a boarding pass or to stamp the ticket printout. Then you have to wait in line again."
2571,4165,Belarusians are additionally checked. Takes from 10 to 30 minutes.
2572,4167,Small and efficient airport. The only downside is that there is no public transport to the airport. You can only get there by car or taxi.
2573,4168,"The WiFi was not working at the airport, and also the immigration officer wasn't the nicest of all time, but all in all, it was a pleasant experience."
2574,4169,"Quite a large airport compared to Tivat. We were greeted warmly, the customs officers were understanding, we quickly checked through, we received our luggage and went for a swim."
2575,4175,"This airport can also only be reasonably reached by taxi. Check in was a bit slow. Security check quick and neat. Duty Free Shop is small but well organized. A huge problem is that there are no sealed plastic bags for transit passengers. Since you have to go through hand luggage control again in Belgrade, it was a big struggle to be allowed to carry the duty free alcohol you had bought with you."
2576,4176,Small. Nasty taxi drivers. Policemen do not talk non-Serbian or pretend they don't.
2577,4177,Great airport specially coz u can go and see plane take off runway is near and open for watch!!!So great!!!
2578,4178,Small but homelike airport. Beautiful view to the airplanes parking from nearby cafe. Long lines on departure during peak of a season.
2579,4180,Good airport but took a while in areas that it shouldnt. good facilities but dont arrive too early before your flight
2580,4181,"Fast check-in , the security check point was fast and the passport control the police officers were kind , very helpful .everything was alright there"
2581,4187,verry good airport passport control is faster than other airports
2582,4188,GOOD
2583,4189,"Nice Airport, but limited facilities"
2584,4190,"The airport was clean. Passport control was easy, and baggage claim was fast. A bit of a walk to the car rental area though."
2585,4191,"CMN is a very basic airport, and the security screening is overly complicated (due to terrorism). Bags are checked at least three times, and online/mobile check-in is unavailable. I had to physically go to the desk to get a PAPER boarding pass, drop bags, and then clear immigration the old way. The terminal is somewhat worn, and not a nice place to hang out long-term."
2586,4192,I MOVED FOR THE FIRST TIME AND SECOND ABROAD FLIGHT IN MY LIFE TROUGH THE FAST TRACK HABIBEE!! Food Sneakers
2587,4193,Pretty good airport. But at the entry its not THAT CLEAN… The Passeport checks is very very slow. But overall… its a good airport :)
2588,4194,The airport was reachable by the train. I was in Tangier and I took the train in the morning with a stop in Casa Voyageurs. Business Class check-in desks were available. The line at the security was extremely slow. I was boarding at the F gates. The only thing that was open was a small duty-free shop and Starbucks. WiFi works great. Airport Lounge was closed.
2589,4196,Cleanest airport in the world!!! Newspapers Clean toilets Best Wi-Fi performance All in all! The best airport in world!!! OMG! is better than LAX
2590,4197,The new terminal 1 with hte new organisation is easy to access. we spend less time in border control immigration and controls and the traffic is more fluent.
2591,4200,"It's a friednly and clean airport with good facilities. However, we were a bit disappointed that none of the coffee shops accepted foreign cards or euros. We had no local money at that point :-)"
2592,4201,"Fez has a nice and friendly airport. It's a good idea to exchange the money there and not in the city. Although the airport doesn't have the best rate, in the end it's easier and cheaper that way because most banks and ATMs have a fee for exchange."
2593,4204,"Very good airport, you can travel with no retards. The new terminal is big and beautiful and is much better than the old one. the controllers are nice and kind You can go to the airport with the highway from Meknes if some people live their"
2594,4205,"small airport, quite long waiting time for a visa"
2595,4208,Pretty lacklustre. Had to take off my shoes for security which is never a good thing. Check-in line was way too long. Stores and cafes are way too limited and lacklustre looking.
2596,4209,Immigration and baggage claim were very quick. Nice red stamp to go parallel with my weak and faint Portuguese stamps. Wifi actually worked here.
2597,4211,"Quite nice airport. If your luggage has been delayed, forget delivery service to your hotel, it doesn't exist here. If you're unlucky, you may get stuck in long queues. Be careful with drones, only the word triggers them ???? Overall experience is good."
2598,4213,When going through departure security men and woman had to go through different cues. Unfortunately the WIFI did not work. on the bright side there was a nice place to get customisable pizza and pasta. For check-in it was not clear on how to do it.
2599,4215,"Securities a bit tight in Morocco (both in CMN/RAK) but the airport is gem. Always fresh airconditioned air, beautiful easy architecture, Wifi, ample spaces of checkin and boarding gates. What else you need! After heatwave of the city a nice stop before heading off back home."
2600,4217,"New terminal that is clean, modern and has beautiful architecture. The signs are clear. We are easily helped and guided by the staff which is appreciated. Welcome to Nador! Enjoy ;)"
2601,4218,"The staff was very nice against the children, the staff can only arabic and french, often englisch. NEVER a delay!! and they forgot once bagage in Amsterdam and the staff solved it very FAST... it's a nice airport with a prayer room and a closen Tax free shop"
2602,4221,"It's not the best airport I have been, but it's just good for the needs of the airport, with just a couple of flights per day is a good airport."
2603,4222,"It is a good airport for this needs, but the customs are very slow, you need to walk from the airplane to the terminal building and there are not seats enought in the building."
2604,4224,"the new RBA Airport (Rabat-salé) is the best, many Airlines (Easyjet, Ryanair, Transavia, RAM, AF, Air Arabia, Tui Fly, ....) and now there are more than 30 destinations (Geneve, Lyon, Nantes, Marseille, Paris orly, Beauvais, Paris CDG, Nice, Barcelone, Madrid, Malaga, Sevilla, London, Dusseldorf weeze, Roma, Bordeaux Toulouse, Bruxelles ....) i recommend"
2605,4225,"The boarding bridge wasn’t operative, so we had to walk. At the immigration desk they asked to fill out a form with some health information, but they have not enough pens and desks. The airport is cozy, clean and organised."
2606,4226,"i think this is the best airport to flight to Morocco, if you not like the crowded airports and long time waiting for checkin and passeport control, this is the best option. avoid Casablanca and Marrakesh airports, you must need to be in airport more than 3 hours before flight departure, but in RABAT 1h30 is more than enough"
2607,4228,"A good airport, the best in Morocco in terms of fast plane arrivals and free internet"
2608,4229,"Excellent airport, a bus shuttle from and to Center is every hour, for 25 Dh (MAD) , about 2,50 € free wifi on all area in airport quick immigration/customs control, less than 10 minutes from Plane arrival and getting outside airport."
2609,4230,"There is an amazing lounge/cafe right outside of the airport: exit the airport building and go the left, ask for cafeteria there. It has a pool, volleyball playground and cheaper menu for traditional food. An oasis! Kind ladies from information also provided me with the VIP lounge wi-fi password, as I arrived too early and they felt sorry for me. Public wi-fi access is limited for the certain GBs."
2610,4231,Best Airport in Morocco Best Airport in Morocco Best Airport in Morocco Best Airport in Morocco Best Airport in Morocco Best Airport in Morocco Best Airport in Morocco Number one Rabat i love youu
2611,4232,"Best Airport in Morocco, it's more better than Casablanca, quick security check, a good terminal facilities, a nice restaurant in the terminal 1, i give this airport 5/5 , like marrakech also 5/5 (but in marrakech a long waiting security check in"
2612,4233,Excellent Airport.
2613,4234,"Overall the Airport was pretty decent, the only disadvantages were that there was no Fast Track security service and the Business Class lounge employees were pretty strict about me taking footage of the lounge area."
2614,4235,There was a FastTrack custom and the custom agent closed the fasttrack area infront of me and told me to wait in the other line.
2615,4236,"I really didn’t like the airport service that day, because an airport employee tried to scam me (as a 13 year old boy). In Tangier Airport right after check in when you’re about to head to the gate, they check the weight of your hand luggage. The guy that was about to weight my hand luggage, dragged my handluggage by his hands and tried to measure the weight of my handluggage with his hands, instead of using a scale. He told me that my handluggage was 5kg too heavy (15kg) and told me to go that I had to pay for the extra kg’s. I thought that he was kidding because he tried to measure my handluggage with his hands. I refused to pay, after that he grabbed my handluggage again and said that my handluggage was 10kg’s too heavy (20KG’s). I told him to use a scale and afterwards he did use a scale and my handluggage weighted 9kg’s and was 1kg too light. He told me that I was lucky and that I would’ve paid 50 euros."
2616,4237,Waited one hour at the pasport check. Very slow working people. Airport WIFI was not working with any email provided.
2617,4238,One the best airports I've been to in my entire life honestly staff are incredibly helpful everything is good expect food there no choice
2618,4239,"Nice new terminal , very airy and with everything in a small airport."
2619,4252,"NO WIFI AT THE AIRPORT, FOOD STALL NOT SO MANY, TOILET ONLY HAVE 1 TOILET IN INTERNATIONAL ARRIVAL NEW AIRPORT"
2620,4253,"Excellent airport, speedy through Immigration, baggage claim and customs. The airport staff are friendly and eager to help, a nice surprise."
2621,4254,"Yangon's domestic terminal does not offer much, but a few coffee shops and restaurants. It is clean, offers 30 min. complimentary wifi. Tons of seating possibilities, but tons of announcements too."
2622,4256,"The airport is efficient and quick. Immigration was a bit slow, with the visa checking etc. Luggage was there fast, and money changing service, SIM card and taxi were easily found. Staff is friendly and helpful. Small airport, going through some construction for expansion at the moment."
2623,4258,"Nothing special. You can't get lost here. It's pretty small. Wifi is ready but not that convenient. There are a few shops selling local merchandise, but nothing much to buy. You probably have to stay in the airport as there is nothing much to see around it."
2624,4261,Slowly Time when you visit.
2625,4262,"Small airport, but has everything you need. Immigration went well, you just need to have all your papers (e.g. international birth certificate for children under 18) ready. Rental cars can be picked up and dropped off right in fron of terminal."
2626,4264,All fine. Line for health check and customs was ok. Luggage was already there when passed through customs.
2627,4265,Very chaotic check-in. Only three counters wher one had no norking baggage scale and one had no printer. Very long queue and flight delay as the check in took too long.
2628,4266,Not having a second staircase for deboarding an A330 Made the process very slow. The immigration staff is very unfriendly.
2629,4268,"Overall more than I had exprected, the airport is clean and organized. Getting to WDH is a 30 minutes trip but very affordable if travelling by private shuttle (make sure you choose a trustworthy company or ask your hotel/hostel to organize it). Check-in may take a few minutes, especially if several flights depart within the next hour, however check-in staff is well-trained and was able to handle uncommon requests. At WDH you will find very few shops and stores and espacially airside-shops are very expensive as almost exclusively european prodcuts (e.g. toblerone) are offered for 5 times the prize you'd pay in euope. Staff at the security check (as well as at immigration) is not that motivated and could show a bit more patience while filling their forms and answering questions regarding our stay."
2630,4273,The airport is very crowded and slow but everyone seemed like they were trying to make the best of it
2631,4274,Very small airport. cannot handle more than 02 flights at ta time at immigration or baggage handling. Not many outlets available at airport. SIM card counters are readily available and are cheap.
2632,4275,Airport is centrally located. Though it's been a messed up airport since ages. It wears a Very unorganised look. View of Himalayas is what covers all this.
2633,4276,I flew from Delhi to Kathmandu and immigartion was crowded as there is a seperate line at Nepal immigration for Indian citizens. Most of the people on board were Indians and Nepalese hence it took a lot of time to clear immigration. Try to deboard the plane quickly and reach the immigration counter as quick as possible. The immigration agents were very kind. Good Job Nepal!!
2634,4277,The airport may get congested at times so make sure that you arrive well in time for your flight. Remember to keep your boarding pass with you as it is required to collect your baggage.
2635,4282,I loved the Kathmandu Valley which was one the most beautiful city in the world just 5 centuries ago where rest of the world was just crawling for the development. As soon as you land Tribhuwan International Airport you will be able to see the great himalayan trails. a fer kilometers away view of the mountain is really beautiful. I have seen many foreigners crying just they face north seeing the snowy large mountains ranges. It is the best destination I ever have had. Being a photographer for the newyork times my visit to NEPAL was really astonishing and enjoyable. Thank you Nepal and Thank you TIA
2636,4284,"The airport has nothing, really, except a tarmac. If you need food, drinks or the bathrooms, step outside to the German bakery or any of the number of teahouses or shops that line the airport. No matter where you stay in Lukla, you won't be more than a 10-minute walk away from the airport. It helps to have your ticket bought ahead of time but if not, there are offices downstairs where you can purchase one on the fly. And if that fails, then hit up your teahouse owner (stay at the Sunny Garden for a teahouse owner with connections) for help. Despite how warm or humid it may be outside, it's surprisingly cool inside the airport and you'll want to layer up a bit. It's almost like it's air-conditioned in there. If you have time, stand behind the fence outside the airport and watch the planes land and take off. It's like nothing else you've ever seen in your life."
2637,4285,"Absolutely amazing small airport. Well known as The most dangerous airport in the World. Skilled pilots, good weather and it looks like amazing landing between mountains. Don't worry"
2638,4286,"The airport is not very big but has decent facilities available and check in, security, etc. is very quick.Remember to keep your boarding pass with you as it is required to collect your baggage."
2639,4287,Its a small airfield converted into an aerodrome. The view from the tarmac is superb with the hills in the background. Only ATRs commute to Kathmandu & its a cute airport I can say so :)
2640,4288,Pokhara is most beatiful citiy in the world.it has various diversity of Nature.beautiful lakes...mountains..and more..
2641,4290,Privium plus is the best thing there is for passengers frequently traveling to and from AMS. Skipping all the queues and receiving lounge access is major.
2642,4291,"I had a long transfer time, didn't have to clear immigration and was able to enjoy the facilities, have some food and a few drinks. I also stopped of in the Schiphol branch of the Rijksmuseum."
2643,4293,"AMS is a great airport to transfer through, particularly if it's a long one. I was able to take a leisurely walk between the two terminal arms. I did not have to clear immigration between the two flights. There are plenty of shops and places to eat. I ate at an Asian restaurant called Kebaya. The entrance is a little confusing as there are different serving options and I didn't think that it was made clearly enough which way to go for each. I also spent some in the Schiphol branch of the Rijksmuseum."
2644,4294,The majority of regional jets like the E175 ends at a hard stand at Schiphol (A gates). You should allow extra time when you connect. And you could have lots of ground to cover on foot.
2645,4295,"The Non-Schengen KLM Lounge is outstanding. It has relatively affordable sleeping pods ($50 for 3h), lockers for baggage, an outdoor deck, two floors of space, tons of seating, and lots of complimentary food and drinks. We had an 8h layover and it flew by in comfort."
2646,4296,If your on this app you need to visit the Panorama open air deck on the roof. It is brilliant for aviation enthusiast's.
2647,4297,"I was transiting from Asia to a non-Schengen country, so no need to clear immigration. There is a security check, but it is less onerous that that to enter the airside part of airports. It was a fair distance between my arrival and departure gates, but I had plenty of time between. AMS is great airport for a long stopover."
2648,4298,"AMS is one of the better airports to spend time between flights at the right time of the day. I was there early enough that everywhere was still open. I had to pass through security, but it is less demanding in terms unpacking bags and fluids. It is a bit slow though."
2649,4301,New luggage scanner did great job. Also possibility of reservation security time for free. Security super fast.
2650,4302,"just a simple small airport with nothing special, no shops or anything at arrivals except a toilet. we got our baggage arround 15/20 min after deboarding the plane"
2651,4304,Way better than last year when I waited 3+ hours in line. Now just 15 minutes. Pity that the only spotting opportunity is in the smoking area.
2652,4305,"Such a good airport! We usually chose Amsterdam Schiphol, but this airport is better. We went past check in, security and customs in less than 20 minutes! The airport was also very clean. Not much to do, but it’s perfect for short European flights."
2653,4306,"Small and modern airport but insanely crowded. It even was difficult to find somewhere to sit while waiting to board in the airside. Security was a bit slow and there were fairly long queues. There is not much to choose from at the airside when it comes to food, plus prices are not any good. Boarding starts soon before departure because your plane could be sitting at the other side of the apron and to get to it you have to walk through a maze of metal fences with no bus."
2654,4307,"Waiting line for bagage drop-off was pretty long, however at security everything went smoothly. Bad wifi, not many seating options."
2655,4308,"Decent size of an airport, the facilities are good, but to get to the terminal building from the tracks is a nightmare. They make you walk outside in all weather conditions in between fences, so you can feel like a prisoner."
2656,4309,Eindhoven airport is a very clean and modern airport. The sacurity Check was very fast although there were many travelers. After the check you will find a large selection of shops. The boarding also goes very well. Only the baggage hall is a bit confusing.
2657,4311,-Friendly control tower and handled competently. -Friendly and curious ground personnel. -many possibilities for photographing incoming aircraft. -Food was fairly simple
2658,4312,"Groningen Airport is by far the most convenient regional airport in The Netherlands. Parking is very well priced and very nearby the terminal. Facilities (restaurant, shop and Wi-Fi) are above average."
2659,4313,"The airport is quite small. Getting to the airport is very easy. It is well connected by highway and busses. The terminal looks nice, the signs could be more clear. The toilets are old and not very clean, also the amount of toilets is too little. It's time to invest in some new toilets. Also some more seats in the departure hall would be nice. Furthermore the flight info could be better, it is just a static display. It is a nice experience to walk over the airport to the plane."
2660,4314,Very small but friendly & clean airport with easy bus connection from/to Groningen (the journey takes ~40 min. from the Central Station by bus #2).The overall opinion of mine is positive but I'd mention 3 negative points: - I would have expected at least one more shop in the terminal building as the only one offers a very few choice of products. - I find it a bit uncomfortable that I was not let to pass the security check until the PAX of the previous flight depart. (I guess it's due to the fact that there would not be enough space for the PAX of more than one flights in terminal building). - The only restaurant offers a poor variety of food. (At least that was the case in the afternoon when my flight departed from GRQ)...
2661,4315,All to expect from a small airport like this. For locals it's like travelling from your own backyard. Quick departing and arriving. Nice and cozy terminal when filled with fellow travellers. Great alternative for Schiphol Amsterdam or Bremen.
2662,4316,"Small airport with quick baggage reclaim. The aiport is a convenient alternative for Schiphol for passengers to/from the Northern Netherlands. The Airportliner shuttle bus takes only 10 minutes to Groningen railway station, the public bus (line 2) a bit longer."
2663,4317,Small airport with a modern terminal. Check-in was fast either was security. It was clean and their was a Duty Free shop and a restaurant in both secure zone and none secure zone. There was enough seating for the only one flight leaving at the time. Baggage claim was quite slow for such a small airport.
2664,4318,"Easily accessible because of its location near an important international highway intersection and a fast alternative for other airports in the region if you need to go to any of the destinations offered from this airport. Airport terminal seems a bit outdated, but with a small cafe and two shops, the facilities are sufficient for a small airport like Maastricht Aachen Airport."
2665,4319,"Very nice airport. Check-in and security check are very fast! For travelers for all around Maastricht (Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands) it's a great gate to the air. Even the free wifi is a nice addition wich was made a few months ago."
2666,4321,very small and cute
2667,4322,"verry quiet airport, almost to quiet"
2668,4325,Perfect airport fast check in For the security you need only wait 2 minutes friendly people fast ground crew and perfect service
2669,4326,"the airport is tiny but it has 2 spotting terraces, one of them available to everyone and the other on the airside. condidering the size it is very comfortable and has surprisingly good amenities."
2670,4327,"Good local airport, the only bad thing is if there are a lot of flights in the morning there are not enough seats for everyone."
2671,4328,Quick check-in and very nice ground staff. Nice panorama deck to spot planes. Over all very nice experience.
2672,4329,Airport is currently under construction to improve facillities. This should be finished during the 2020 summer season. It does affect the current score.
2673,4330,"Nicest airport in the Netherlands. Small, short waiting times at security and check-in, customs and baggage reclaim. When travelling only with hand luggage, time needed to get to your car is 10 minutes after leaving the airplane."
2674,4331,"Regional Airport that knows their stuff. Airport is easily reachable by public transport, check-in and security is done within a few minutes. Due to work in progress, terminal facilities were a bit poor, but still in decent shape. WiFi was free and strong."
2675,4332,"Rotterdam The Haque Airport is an excellent regional airport offering a mix of business and holiday flights. Airport is easily reached by public transport using the underground and/or bus service. Check-in was quick as there was no waiting line with BA Cityflyer and security was alright. Could have perhaps been faster if people actually knew what to take off. Wifi is strong and working constant, while terminal facilities are poor. A restaurant, shop and that's about it."
2676,4333,"Pleasant, fast, and affordable. Airport features huge waiting/eating area with a few restaurants. Duty free shop available. One of the most efficient airports I've ever been to, security took under 5 minutes."
2677,4334,"The best regional airport you can imagine. Swift handling,. no queues, parking next door. In short; Ideal!!"
2678,4336,"Airport is currently being renovated. They bus travelers to and from the plane. I didn’t mind walking down the jet bridge and spending time on the tarmac, but my wife felt differently. Highly recommend SXM for travel. People are nice, reasonably priced, and an aviation nerds dream!"
2679,4340,"I flew in from the USA. The next time I am due to fly in will be long-haul from Europe. The airport is relatively quiet and can easily handle the load from a short haul flight in terms of immigration and baggage claim. It will be interesting to experience it when arriving on an A330-200. For me, I had a short walk from the terminal to the car rental firm that I had booked a car with. Onward travel from there is hassle free although the traffic in Simpson Bay can get a little busy at certain times of the day."
2680,4341,"SXM is easy to get to. It is within walking distance of some areas and from the independent car rental companies. It is small enough to pass through simply. It does lack some facilities found in larger airports, but it is not terrible."
2681,4342,"Still a lot of rebuilding to do from Irma. But they run it well, just plan on extra time getting to the airport and to your gate. At least two hours."
2682,4344,Great little airport. Small and compact and a very Caribbean feel. Maho Beach is great and a good mix of airlines flying to and from this beautiful airport. WiFi was good and customs was a breeze. Very easy to navigate through the airport.
2683,4345,Nice Beach
2684,4346,Easy to navigate airport and friendly staff all along the way. Transport to/from downtown Noumea could be better.
2685,4347,"Very small but cute and well kept airport. Lounge was just the same, small but nicely organised with small but very good selection of food and drinks. Plus, view over apron from lounge. Not that anything happens, but still nice."
2686,4348,Compact international airport about 40 mins drive from Noumea. Very clean and bright with good signage. Security overly pedantic and under manned. Excellent DF facilities for a small airport. Bang on time departure
2687,4349,"Lovely airport nestling in the hills near Tontouta. Not especially busy so no ATC delays. Within 30 minutes of landing we were outside the terminal, with our luggage, and on our way to our hotel"
2688,4350,Small but okay.
2689,4352,"Crew was nice, and good food selection. Our flight got cancelled, and they made us go through biosecurity twice for some reason."
2690,4353,"Easy to navigate, friendly staff, that's about it really."
2691,4354,Security is always a shambles at AKL domestic. Allow at least one hour before scheduled boarding time to get through security.
2692,4356,"Pretty standard airport. Not much to do in the domestic terminal, but adequate for an hour transfer. Regional lounge was very full."
2693,4357,The check-in experience was okay but not that great.There was lots of amazing restaurants to eat at and we settled for a cafe where we got amazing lasagna and fish and chips.Security was quiet in the evening which was nice.
2694,4358,Getting through customs was pleasant and friendly. Getting through bio-security took over an hour. Agents were nice but overwhelmed by number of people. Signage getting from customs to bio-security was not good.
2695,4359,"Its okay. Its an airport. Auckland traffic is bad and there is little public transport to the airport. The Air NZ lounge is excellent, not quite Qantas lounge level, but still really good. Loved the free lamb chops!"
2696,4360,No lounge but it was ok.Great food at the airport.Come early to check-in for less lines!There are my favorite departure boards!
2697,4361,"Auckland Airport is one of the best airports I have ever been to, getting to the airport is always so easy as you can just walk right in, it has strong WiFi and the food places are always open, sometimes security can take awhile but most of the time it is alright."
2698,4363,1 or 2 of the staff was weirdly passive aggressive but apart from that everyone was nice and the process was made quick and easy.
2699,4364,"Good airport. I arrived, didn't get my bags since everything was shoved in my backpack, and left the airport. Easy to navigate, helpful facilities, good airport. Also lots of interesting aircraft and plane spotting locations for nerds. (like me)"
2700,4365,"Regional at CHC offers a very good airport experience. Checkin is very easy, and then a quick walk to the gate. No security required as well, increasing speediness of Christchurch Airport."
2701,4366,"Fast airport to get through. Arriving internationally in CHC means very quick and small queues for passport control and customs, surprising given NZ's strict biosecurity rules. In addition, the exit is about 100m from the arrivals area, meaning that it is very speedy to get from aircraft to outside."
2702,4367,"Very good airport. Security and passport control very efficient. Not a huge deal of services open at 5am, but still very good airport."
2703,4368,"Very good airport. Security seemed a little lax, but fast queues as we were the first flight in the morning to depart."
2704,4369,Having no phone I didn't have any need for wifi but Christchurch does offer free wifi. Christchurch Airport offers lots of cool experiences and shops for merch or food. Really friendly staff.
2705,4370,"Always love Christchurch Airport - not far from gates back through to baggage claim, quick ground handling so bags are almost always there when you get there, and easy to navigate the airport with its logical layout. It's also very close to the city!"
2706,4371,The International Koru Lounge was disappointing when the Domestic lounge at CHC is brilliant. There was only a coffee machine and it wasn’t working and the food left a fair bit to be desired.
2707,4372,The international airside was very impressive. Plenty of shops and food outlets. Lounge was like a business office and had a large selection of food to eat.
2708,4377,Kerikeri is a small regional airport with a cafe and a cool aircraft spotting window. Very quick airport to get through.
2709,4378,Brand new terminal. Only Air NZ operates scheduled flights at this airport. The terminal has a small cafe and rental car desks
2710,4380,The new lookout upstairs is beautiful. Loved sitting with my coffee with the large windows watching planes come and go. Food is overpriced though but what do you expect?
2711,4381,Airport was small with work still being done to the terminal. The lounge had limited food to eat but the views outside of the lounge were fantastic.
2712,4382,Feels more like an appartment than an airport (which I like). Everything is well organised and just a few steps away
2713,4383,GOOD Small regional airport. regular flyer out if Napier the staff are very helpful would recommend
2714,4384,"Fine for a regional airport but small, only 1 cafe. Would have rated 2 stars but the cafe does superb coffee so added an extra star. Long term parking expensive."
2715,4385,Very easy airport to collect bags and to exit the airport. And there’s also sparrows in the terminal ????!
2716,4386,A good airport to check in very easily. A small amount of cafes and shops. It’s really funny seeing birds in the terminal eating leftovers ????!
2717,4387,"Extremely nice airport, very new, clean, perfect and huge waiting and seating areas, easy to get there"
2718,4388,always love getting back home to nelson :)
2719,4389,"Check-in with AirNZ staff at New Plymouth involved a family member, and 2 other people, and 2 powered wheelchairs. These are heavy but the weighing and loading arrangements were all handled with a highly friendly efficiency. A hard act to follow!"
2720,4390,"New Terminal. Clean, spacious, friendly check-in staff, large seating area while waiting to board; large windows to airside with expanse views of the operating area."
2721,4391,"The existing 60-year-old terminal is to be replaced by a new terminal, presently under construction. Food outlet - very good quality but the only outlet available. Checkin -Air NZ staff most helpful."
2722,4392,"The existing terminal was built in the 1960's, and is nearing the end of its useful life. A new terminal is under construction and is due for completion Nov-Dec, 2019. Check-in staff are friendly and efficient. Food outlet is good but the only outlet available."
2723,4395,Really nice airport with lots of nice staff at the shops and helping with the SUPER SIMPLE check in process.
2724,4396,"Very nice flight going from Palmerston to Auckland. Airport is lovely and clean! Food is nice, a variety to choose from. Bathroom facilities are well maintained. I would defiantly highly recommend flying this route as it usually arrives ahead of schedule."
2725,4397,Fantastic airport. Great services. Fast. Needs to be used more.
2726,4398,"Departure tax is payable at the airport - $5 for domestic, $25 for international. Because the airport mainly sees aircraft under 90 seats, NZ aviation regulations means no security."
2727,4399,"Easy pick up of dogs from oversize baggage was easy, and was quick to get the dogs outside and settled. The one way system for the toilets in the gate lounges was not well marked, and confusing for many passenfers"
2728,4400,"Uber don't have right to drive near to airport terminal, so you have to walk with suitcases ca.5min. Very good quality food at food service place."
2729,4402,"Great little airport; very quick getting checked in. It gets rather crowded, though, and there aren't any amenities after security. The Air NZ Koru lounge is good sized, with all the usual features of a Koru lounge. It's before security like everything else, but of course it only takes 5-10 minutes max to process through security."
2730,4403,"Amazingly scenic approach. No airbridges so quick to disembark through front and rear doors, although you are exposed to the cold in ski season!"
2731,4404,"Virgin provided the front window economy seats on the right sight of the aircraft for myself and 4 friends, with a beautiful view of Queenstown on departure. Middle seat was unoccupied which meant plenty of space and amazing views for the hop across the Tasman."
2732,4405,"A very good small airport. It is nice and clean and even had a lounge, which was small and had not much food. Immigration and customs were very slow and only 2 or 3 stalls were being used. Lines were huge, it took 15 minutes to get through"
2733,4406,"An amazing airport to fly into, looking out towards the snow capped mountains and also the pristine blue water down below. The airport itself is very small and has only 1 or 2 small plane loads in the terminal at once, this makes the immigration and baggage claim very easy and stress free."
2734,4407,"Not a bad airport, although for the traffic it gets and the rich folk it serves, it could use more shops, etc."
2735,4408,Great Airport
2736,4409,"No dedicated spotting area, a nice walkway between airrivals and departures, two shops, no security."
2737,4410,"Excellent new Departure and Arrival Terminal. Small, clean and modern. Just what you need for a regional Airport."
2738,4411,Standard regional airport - does the job. Could do with Navaids update to prevent so many diversions/cancellations every time it comes on to rain!
2739,4412,"Short walk from pre-booked parking, quick check-in and easy check-in of dogs made the outbound leg a breeze"
2740,4413,"WLG is a very nice airport. Security was very quick, as was checkin. Food at Air NZ lounge excellent, although it was airside."
2741,4414,"Security here was the strangest. My bag failed security check only because I had tiny first aid scissors but the strange thing is I had them on my carry on leaving Christchurch and they didn't cause any problem. I failed the body X-ray for no reason at all as well. Other wise super friendly staff, great viewing windows and a positive experience!"
2742,4415,Amazing Airport with plenty of stalls selling food and drink theirs also plenty of seating to relax
2743,4417,"Very good when arriving Domestically, very easy to get out when exiting the airport. When at the pick-up it’s very confusing where to go to get to the upper level. But there was some hidden stairs ???? to go up!"
2744,4418,"easy to get around, convient shops, the dedicated spotting area isn't very good and turboprop gates are a bit tedious."
2745,4419,"Very confusing gate system at the moment due to construction and COVID. Otherwise good, Koru lounge in domestic section is very nice and provided a great breakfast selection!"
2746,4427,"Abuja airport is a lovely one, it's quite an open area with so much space and outside you could stretch your legs if you want. To me it's okay."
2747,4428,"The airline logos at their respective check-in counters are not very visibility. Finding the Dana counter required asking for directions. The COVID 19 protocol in place at in and around the terminal is reasonable. The PA system in the departure lounge is inaudible, you need to extra attentive to hear the boarding calls."
2748,4429,"first time arrival, easy to go through control and Covid medical check. Baggage claim was fast. problem outside terminal, lots of ""helpers"" who can do anything to get money and cheat you."
2749,4430,"Brand new airport, easily accessible, short walks, very helpful and friendly staff. Only issue is the filling in of forms for departure formalities. Only one duty free shop till date."
2750,4434,"Much better organised. The staff were pleasant right through immigration and customs. As always, KLM/Air France check in staff (NAHCO) were very poilte. Among the best staff at check in I've experienced anywhere."
2751,4440,"I was not that happy with the situation of the airport, because as the busiest airport in Nigeria the terminals are meant to be big. I guess they are building a new terminal. The airline was very fair with the price the asked me to pay for extra luggage. The security officers asked me for bribe but I refused. One more thing never collect something from anybody."
2752,4441,"Getting to the airport was quite good. Rain was falling the day I went, from the car park to the MMA2 terminal the rain was leaking at some parts but people were there to clean it up. The food I ate at Barcelos was good and I checked in on time."
2753,4450,"Surprisingly very good WIFI even before any of the staff arrives in the early morning. Plus hundreds of chirping birds around the airport on green trees and grass, it's really the time to use this airport in spring."
2754,4451,"Perfect small airport! Service is excellent, not so far from Struga and Ohrid. Good, nice, wonderful, amazing, beautiful, what else should i write? Hm? Come and visit it! Omg, too much words i need to write but i have no more idead what to write. Hah."
2755,4452,Very goood i was there in the summer 2012 :)
2756,4453,A nice small airport. Fast security and emigration. Terminal facilities adequate. Distance to city about 30 minutes by taxi £25
2757,4454,"Small but very convinient airport. It does not have a lot of things to do here, but it is peaceful and not overcrowded. Easy check in, passport control and security check are right next to each other, and limited number of gates, meaning easy to navigate. Once you are upstairs you cannot exit and there is no outdoor terrace."
2758,4455,"Small, but very well organised and clean airport. It is very easy to navigate and easy to check in and to find your gate. However, would not recommend eating as the prices are 10 times more expensive here than they would usually be. If you need transport to the city center there are shuttle busses which come and go few times a day depending on the flights that day. Overall good airport and the staff is nice."
2759,4456,"Its vety good airport for this region, at the same time landed my plane with another 4 and there eas a delay at customs, but evrything else was fine."
2760,4457,"Very handy airport, rather large and spatious, not very crowded. Getting there with Public Transport is not that easy though. If you have a Frequent Flyer Program, the lounge is handy, though not very impressive."
2761,4459,"excellent, all is perfect for such small and frequfent airport but must to work hard to be getting better,to make easier way of WiFi connections,also there isnot visitor terace to enjoy in view od landing and departing aircrafts"
2762,4460,"It's not the smallest airport I've been at, but it's not that big either. It has almost everything you might need from food and beverages to office supplies. It has great connections with the city of Skopje (bus, taxi, car rental, etc.)."
2763,4461,"excellent airport, easy check in, security checks and access to flight gates... excellent airport, easy check in, security checks and acces to flight gates"
2764,4462,"excellent airport, easy check in, security checks and access to flight gates... excellent airport, easy check in, security checks and acces to flight gates"
2765,4463,"Small and easy airport that is easy to navigate. Just renovated and added more facilities as restaurant/bar, bigger waiting area etc. Clean and nice. Good parking area just outside terminal. Direct flights to Riga, London, Amsterdam, Copenhagen plus more."
2766,4464,"Somewhat restricted space in terminal, but an extension is underway. Quite a good selection of airlines for a small town. Very crowded near the luggage belts."
2767,4465,The small airport outside of Aalesund is getting better for each year offering more destinations to Europe and have just opened a new terminal with more food and bar facilities. Short way to gates after security check-in and close parking to the terminal.
2768,4466,"Nice small airport. You can get to the airport either by bus or your own car. Only a few check-in desks are available, for some airlines (e.g. KLM) you have to use one of the several self service check-in terminals. There were no queues at the security check. Unfortunately there was no free WiFi, however you can use WiFi if you pay for it. All in all it was a nice small airport."
2769,4467,Free wi-fi. great!
2770,4469,very small and crowdy
2771,4474,"When you arrive from UE and taking a domestic flight, you need to exit to the terminal and pass by the security check again"
2772,4475,"When you arrive from UE and taking a domestic flight, you need to exit to the terminal and pass by the security check again"
2773,4477,"Very smart airport, modern and quick to get through on a Friday afternoon. Great views across the airfield while waiting. The light rail from the centre of Bergen itself is easy, frequent and takes about 45mins."
2774,4478,"A small regional airport, has everything you need, but that said a little pricey, staff were helpful, facilities were good"
2775,4479,"Super happy about the new terminal, it is such a nice change to Flesland. Easy to get from City centre to Flesland, because of Bybanen. Bybanen is also not that expensive, and is a nice ride overall."
2776,4480,"The signs weren't very good. Not easy to see where you were supposed to go when you got of the plane. When I got into the terminal building, there was no departure board to see, and I had to walk past every gate to see which one was mine."
2777,4481,"Leave plenty of time to clear security, they are friendly but depending on how your hand luggage is packed they can be quiet thorough about scanning it multiple times. There is nothing intimidating or threatening about this, just takes a bit longer then most other airports."
2778,4482,"A very nice local airport. Local buses terminate just in front of the terminal building. No check-in desks, only self service. Security check is always empty, you can get through within seconds"
2779,4483,It’s average and looks a little run down these days. Not very much selection for sit down restaurants. Needs a complete renovation/rebuild
2780,4484,Small domestic airport with links to Lofoten Islands. Not a lot of facilities to choose from and no lounge.
2781,4485,Great airport. Extremely fast luggage handling.
2782,4489,"Small airport that usually works quite well. Can be heavy lines on check-in, these can be avioded by turning up ahead of the buses from Narvik, Harstad and Sortland. A small restaurant and a kiosk airside, nothing outside security."
2783,4490,Small and clear airport. The luggage arrived very quickly - SAS has a good ground service here.
2784,4491,"Nice wather, sunrise, good landing"
2785,4492,simple and easy!
2786,4494,"This airport is small and easy to get through. The line at check in is the shortest I have experienced and if you get to security at a good time that line is quite short as well. There is a kiosk in the terminal wich sells sandwiches, hot dogs and baguettes as well as snacks, soda and water. There is also plenty of seats when there are few flights (there's rarely more than three flights at the time). Overall the terminal facilites are ok. Last time I was there there was no wifi but that may have changed when the airport changed ownership earlier this year. The airport is ok to get to, it's not that far from Park-Inn so it's not that expensive to get a taxi. There's also an airport bus from Flotmyr Bussterminal. If you're staying on Karmøy you'll have to get a taxi or drive yourself. If you're staying a long time there's also car rental facilities at the airport."
2787,4497,"free trip on alupress as my retierment present with ann my wife. small airport but good service,weather was cold."
2788,4498,"Very windy. A bit turbulente due to wind casts, bit overall good landing."
2789,4502,All right.
2790,4503,Quick luggage
2791,4505,The Kristiansand/Kjevik Airport is a very small and efficient airport. The check in and security area has been recently upgraded to the same modern standards as many other Avinor airports.
2792,4506,"Small airport, very easy to get to and from, and navigate when you're there. Not much to do when you're waiting, but it gets you where you need to."
2793,4507,Very small and cozy airport ! Good to start trip in Norge !
2794,4508,"Experienced as small and cramped. Often problems with the luggage belt (very little). In addition, the airport needs a renovation (looks a bit old, especially inland arrivals."
2795,4510,"Very small aiport, few destinations but also few passangers so it all flow fast"
2796,4511,"Small airport, but fortunately under development. It is efficient and the flights are mostly on time."
2797,4512,"Everything goes quickly, except for the security check in the morning. It could have needed a couple of extra locks."
2798,4513,Nice airport that works well. Very efficient and with very few delays.
2799,4516,"With so few flights per day, baggage claim and transiting the airport are a breeze. There is a bus service which meets arriving flight to transfer passenger to the town."
2800,4517,"I love this airport. Check-in and security are easily negotiated. There are limited facilities, but that is not a major issue for me."
2801,4522,"Small airport, very slow security check on International travels. Only one security scanner in operation. Duty free is small with a poor selection. The kiosk had a limited selection of food and snacks. + for water fountain to fill up your own water bottle."
2802,4523,"Nice small airport. Short ways so arriving an hour before flight is good enough. Just a kiosk for food, but you don't wait long. WiFi for free. Good seating. The lavatories need an upgrade. Fast baggage claim on arrival."
2803,4525,Smooth and fast as always.
2804,4526,Small airport. Somewhat disorganized.
2805,4528,"Small airport with small size and short distances. Slightly crowded this morning, but."
2806,4532,Flytoget runs through the station making it the fastest way from the Airport to the City Centre (Oslo Sentralstasjon)
2807,4533,"Only for changing flights. Long ways between the gates and not easy to walk across the duty free shopping mall. But at the end, we made it."
2808,4534,"Oslo vas not redd for snow! They where 1,5 hours late because of the weels was spinning in the snow."
2809,4535,"Arrived at the military part of the airport, titled GEN back then before the construction of the current terminal, which dates back to 1998-10-08"
2810,4536,"OSL has now been my home airport since March 2016, and I am proud of it and enjoy using it. High ceilings, large spaces and large windows form a basis for a travel friendly atmosphere. On this particular occasion, we almost missed our flight. Thanks to excellent service and communication between staff at Flytoget and the airport, our last minute check-in was smooth and swift."
2811,4537,"Fantastic airport, if you are going to fly domestic, you should try the osl lounge at A15 very nice (arrive 3 hours early)"
2812,4538,"Wonderful and beautiful, clean, wooden, modern airport, with a train station (Oslo Lufthavn Stasjon) built below it with very regular trains to Oslo Sentralstasjon (or Oslo City Centre)."
2813,4539,"more expensive food comapred to other airports, might as well get sas plus if you are flying sas, paid 130 kr for just one bun and one small coke"
2814,4540,Beware: Oslo airport has no food options for gluten-free people after 21.00. Also not a lot of seating in the terminal. Check-in and security was at least quick.
2815,4541,"Absolutely FANTASTIC! This airport is brilliant, makes JFK and LHR look rubbish. Great food and retail, a bit on the expensive side but it’s fine. Even if you don’t have access to a lounge, there are really nice seating areas. It is so spacious and airy, it’s like being outside. This airport would be great for layovers and connecting flights. Overall one of the best airports I have ever been to."
2816,4542,"A small airport, a bit similar to Modlin. Young because it was opened in 2007 and in 3 days it is closed to commercial traffic. It's a pity because it's much better than TRF. Tuesday morning, security check quick and efficient, no queues. WiFi lightning. Prices in stores are crazy! Generally OK!"
2817,4543,"Have only arrived at this airport by car, so I don't really know about Public transport. Parking is fine every time. I tend to always be checked in online prior to arriving at the airport. Wifi is on and off. Security check is on and off in regards to service level."
2818,4544,A small cozy airport with a large duty-free and fast good staff! No Lounge and a slow wi-fi! security check is small and slow while check-in is fast and effective! Trevel to the airport and it's a motorway directy but no information sign where you can turn to the airport I like the Moss Rygge!
2819,4545,"Small, nice airport. Maybe way from plane to terminal is a bit long... but in general it's ok. Clean, has a big parking, . Enough for low cost airlines airport. Good connection to Oslo, lots of buses."
2820,4547,"It's part Ryanair airport, part military airstrip, and the latter is an especially cool way to kill time before your flight. As you're sitting by one of the windows, a loud roar will startle you out of your reverie and a fighter jet will rocket down the runway, increasingly assaulting your eardrums as it gets closer to liftoff. Public transportation is pretty organized close to the airport, but that's because there's only one way in: a shuttle bus that waits for your train to arrive. There's supposed to be free wifi on the shuttle bus, but I couldn't connect."
2821,4548,"Quiet airport but facilities first class, if not ludicrously expensive."
2822,4550,"Very nice, funcional, clean and well organized tiny airport. Obviously, for low cost standards. But it has everything you need - big windows with views of the runway and free wifi!"
2823,4551,"Small airport, you can get through quickly. Duty-free shop after landing"
2824,4552,Nice little airport. In walking distance from the train station Torp (and the Airbnb 150 m away from the station).
2825,4553,Ectrec4rcd4rcd4dcd4ecx4rc4de4cde4cdd4cde4cdd4cdr4dcrdc4rxc4rxc4dxc4dtcxdc4xd4cxxxd4cdrc4ddcd4dc4xrcx4dcx4rc4 Good airport
2826,4554,"Great airport, very nice staff. Security check gave me a small pack of candy as a gift. Passport check staff was always smiling and in a good mood! Very interactive. Definitely recommend airport to f you are planning to travel"
2827,4555,"The custom / immigration office needs to make an office / line only for who works and live in Norway, in order to skip long and useless queue due to stupid travellers, who think that travelling in Norway is simple as going to the supermarket. We can’t wait forever to go out of the AirPort, especially if we need to wait a lot in a big room that becomes really small when we are 100 people and of course everybody needs to breathe!"
2828,4558,The airport closes for a few hours during the night and it's very frustrating that you cannot stay in the airport if you have a layover or a very early flight. But on the fun side it has a tree in the middle of the airport.
2829,4559,"Good regional airport.. Only thing that wasen't good was the price for a pizza slice at Peppes Pizza at the airport. 48NOK (5.7EUR). But that's not something the airport can do with, but it ruined a little bit of the experience."
2830,4560,"Problems at the gates - instead of scanning codes from boarding card, stuff was rewriting sequence codes to the laptop. Waiting time was long because of this. Everything else was ok. Small, local airport."
2831,4561,"Very good airport. Opened new terminal this year very nice there too! New luggage straps, large space. Perfectly connected by train and Shuttlebus. Possibility of long distance bus and taxi. Good food at Narvesen, costs a little but but. Small restaurant inside the terminal. Very good security. Never a problem, the staff pleasant. Nice view of the runway from terminalen.Veldig good plans for the future by expanding the terminal and so on. Very good parking facilities and cheap. Good spotters places many spotters around the airport."
2832,4563,Is a small airport so to get thru the customs dosen't take long time and neither to claim your baggage.
2833,4564,"Getting to the airport is still a mess. This is probably one of the few airports in the world that doesnt use departure/arrival signs when you drive to the airport. There is P4, shortterm, kiss and fly, P7, P11 and so on. Why not use international standards like arrivals -> here, departures -> there."
2834,4566,Airport shuttle bus is temporary cancelled. Very few shops and food courts are open. Service is efficient
2835,4567,"Lounge at SVG is very nice. friendly staff, enough snacks and drinks. Comfortable chairs and modern/fresh interior."
2836,4568,"New bag claim carousel, much better. Given size of the airport, going through and collecting bags is quick."
2837,4569,Overall good score. -1 star due to lack of sitting-groups in gate area and long cues by the water dispenser.
2838,4570,Great fast track service at Stavanger airport. Very fast. 2hrs free internet access at Stavanger airport.
2839,4571,"Good airport, easy to find what you are looking for like gates etc. free wifi for 2 hours access. A lot of cafe's and bars."
2840,4574,"Due to construction works (as of April 2023) departure was in a from a temporary inflatable structure! Very basic, but not uncommon considering my Wizzair experience in Budapest."
2841,4575,"3 local buses stop not far from the terminal buildings. The whole airport is under reconstruction. Only just a few place to get food or other things, but clearly more are demanded."
2842,4576,Arrive at international terminal C. There is a shuttle bus service between the main building and the distance of 200 km.
2843,4578,There is no issue with getting to the airport. There is a very efficient bus service linking the airport to the town. Some of the gate lounge areas are a little spartan.
2844,4579,"TOS feels like a laid back airport. I felt very comfortable passing through the airport. It is located west of Tromso with a mountain between the two, but the journey is straightforward due to the tunnel through the mountain. There is a regular bus service and with several pick-up and drop-off points in the town. The bus driver that I had was very understanding and allowed me to get on despite standing at the wrong bus stop."
2845,4581,"Although it arrived at 16:17, the only shop in arrival hall (baggage reclaim) had already closed. The airport didn’t contain currency exchange store which was inconvenient to tourists. It was exactly small even in the same scale of airports all over the world. The transportation choice for connecting the city and the airport was also countable. To conclude, it was not user-friendly."
2846,4583,"A very pleasant airport with stunning views all around. Security check was quite friendly and polite. A bit light on for places to get coffee or a snack. Plenty of space to walk around and watch flights coming and going, and exercising before your flight."
2847,4584,"Nice small airport. Quick check-in and security. Only food options where a kiosk with hot dogs, everything else where under renovation. But, they had gluten-free options, so a big plus."
2848,4585,"Getting to the airport is easy and convenient, and doesn't cost too much. It is, however, quite small and does not have enough sitting spaces."
2849,4586,"Very effective airport, quick check in and effective baggage handling, also short distance to gate. Only issue is food options as they are quite expensive and the quality varies."
2850,4587,"Great airport, short queue in the securety check. Good space in the departure terminal, many resturants and shops."
2851,4588,"Nice, Small Airport Located North From the City, Just 30-45 Minutes Driving, Train will be around 20-30 Minutes (I dont Recommend using the Train its Expensive) The Airport were Under Construction for 2-3 Years, A new Terminal Came, The International And Domestic Terminal(s) Got bigger, More Gates came, New Aprons, The Train Station is still under Construction, i recommend flying to Trondheim where you also can Visit and see Alot from Trondheim City, Stjørdal, Steinkjer. (There is No Lounge at the Airport)"
2852,4589,"Small airport, but has received better offers in recent years. Easy to get there both by bus and train. Relatively expensive parking, but if you stay overnight at one of the neighboring hotels, you can get free parking there."
2853,4590,"Even though this is a relatively small Airport, it has everything the average traveller could ask for. Great Airport Shuttle from downtown, efficient but good securety and a variety of food services. Terminal is easy to navigate and bright and clean"
2854,4591,"The nicest airport of our trip all around Norway. Short lines, very modern building, overall a very good experience. Quite far away from the city but we just stayed inside the airport during transit so I cannot rate it."
2855,4592,"I think that this is a nice airport, there are nice areas to take nice planes pictures. As well this isn't a big airport, so this is good, because everything is faste. And as well it's quiete easy to go to this airport. In general it is a good airport."
2856,4593,Stressless by the gate!
2857,4596,"Small, cozy, no interesting. Very leisurely passport control and baggage check in (Fly Dubai). No good cafes/bars. No wifi (you need sms what not possible to receive)"
2858,4597,best terminal ever visited in my whole life loved it absolute amazing amazing experience oman air the goat!
2859,4599,"The new PTB at Muscat Airport was built in 2018 and is still looking good to this day. Arrival was quick due to the time I arrived at 3:15am. We taxied to the stand and disembarked 5 minutes after the classic ""cabin crew disarm doors and crosscheck"" telling us the journey was over. Despite being at the end of Pier A, the walk was short to Immigration and there was travellators to speed up the walk. There was 2 checks at passport control, one on a pop up table near the start of the queue to check COVID travel insurance and your COVID vaccine pass. Then there was the main check. Border force are friendly and get the job done efficiently. There are multiple lanes, a FastTrack, those on tourist visas, GCC Nationals and E-Gates for Omani nationals and residents. After passport control, I went to baggage claim, the speed on which bags arrived was amazing to the point mine was waiting. After heading through customs, there is plenty of shops to get sim cards from the main providers, OmanTel and Ooredoo. After that you proceed down to the bus station or out to the car parks. Overall Muscat Airport is very nice, clean and, like Dubai, is clearly designed with the traveller in mind."
2860,4602,As already assessed: Small airport but surprising with its good infrastructure. Its boarding gates are the most beautiful I've ever seen. It was a pleasant experience.
2861,4603,Small airport but surprising with its good infrastructure. Its boarding gates are the most beautiful I've ever seen. It was a pleasant experience.
2862,4604,immigration and baggage process so lazy. As for the food at the oman airport need option to accept all currencies in the machine installed there.
2863,4605,"the food service wasn't bad, just few option. Only 1 bar, and they dont even serve muscat wines! JK, but it would have been nice..."
2864,4609,"The airport is definitely an improvement over previous one but the time to go through security and checkin enormous. They should perhaps know the peak hours in advance and deploy more staff during those times. Other than that terminal is clean, spacious. Does not feel congested at all. Seating is good particularly near the gates. Food options are limited but that does not matter - it is supposed to be an airport not a restaurant. Access to airport is also easy - just avoid drop lane if you can."
2865,4610,"Getting to the airport is good, the road not so far and crowded. The terminal facilities not much good. Toilets were clean but there was no handwash in the Corona pandemic. Mosques did not have carpet you have pray on bare ground. The escalator was not working normally. There was not any duty-free shops. It was terrifyingly running fast when you stepped on. WiFi was not usable.there was not enough fast food restaurants I saw only one that they were only stealing money against the food they give. The lounge was not bad."
2866,4611,"This Review is not for the old ""Benazir Bhutto/Chacklala International Airport"", but for the ""New Islamabad/Ghandara"" airport. The airport not that far from Islamabad, but for the passengers coming in from Twin City Rawalpindi that don't live near the motorway, the airport is quite far. With traffic it could take you about 2 hours to get to the New Islamabad Airport. I would therefore rate getting to the airport 4 star because I was coming from Islamabad. The Check-In was seamless and easy, and I give it a 5 stars. Unlike Lahore, in Passport Control there was no line at all. Same for security. That's a 5 Stars. The facilities are like a normal world standard airport and they were clean, so that is a 4 stars. The WiFi was 3 stars. The food and retail was averagely 4 stars. And the CIP lounge was 4 stars."
2867,4612,The New Islamabad Airport is really good it has Jet Bridges is very beautiful it should be one of the best airports
2868,4613,The new Islamabad International Airport is far better than the previous airport. The airport has better facilities and it is capable to handle more passengers and aircrafts. Furthermore it is modern and state of the art in every aspect.
2869,4614,The airport was great and excellent The check in went quick Immigration took a bit of time The boarding was quick
2870,4615,The airport was good We were taken by bus to terminal immigration was slow Baggage claim was slow
2871,4616,The new Islamabad was quite nice and straight forward The staff were good and everything went quick The baggage claim was fast
2872,4618,The new Islamabad International Airport is far better than the previous airport. The airport has better facilities and it is capable to handle more passengers and aircrafts.
2873,4619,It is a small but neat airport. Needs lots of improvement knowing that KHI is an important airport in region but completely ignored by Pakistani Government.
2874,4620,Security near boarding gates tried to open my bag to remove cigarette lighter when I was standing before body scan machine. I’ve shouted at them so they stopped. They took the lighter when I get there but I warned them not to open someone’s bag without passengers presence.
2875,4622,My connecting flight to Islamabad was delayed so the airport staff offered us a complimentary full breakfast which was great
2876,4623,This airport is pretty good. Very clean and comfortable. But immigration is really bad. It's like cats and dogs fighting
2877,4624,"Pretty big airport compared to Isb alongside the services. The baggage area was a bit slow tbh. Apart from that, Its a very nice airport undoubtedly"
2878,4625,Very good airport. Staff is very cooperative and we'll mannered. Facilities was also state of the art. Getting to airport from karachi city is very easy using different and cheap means. Airport has facilities for special persons.
2879,4626,Karachi airport is a beast airport in the world. PIA inside environment is very relaxable. the crew staff is very good. refreshment is not good but we suggest to PIA service center please take action about refreshment matter. at last travel of PIA is peacefull for other airlines.I PROUD TO BE A PAKISTAN.
2880,4627,"its a very good airport,ground staff is very good,I will rank the airport the best airport of pakistan,the terminal facilities are also good,but it should improve the airport facilities..........................."
2881,4628,"Karachi airport is a very beautiful airport,all the things are very good,i like the facilities which were provided at the airport,the lounge is also very good.Karachi is pakistan,s biggest and good airport"
2882,4629,this is a ok airport i guess... i always go here its very dirty and old though but the people arent mean they are fine its pretty small too
2883,4632,Lahore Airport needs structural and management overall. There is always a delay at the luggage belt. Sometimes it takes 30 mins to an hour if there are 2 to 3 flights on ground. Staff is typically NON CUSTOMER SUPPORT. Belts and lounge are overcrowded.
2884,4633,lahore lahore ay its an aeosome airport.......nyc airport in pakistan... the road is very nyc getting to airport is very easy terminal facility is good ..... wifi is also good nd have good speed... foof and retail sercvise sell the googs on double price from normal price lounge area is excellent.... immigration system is also good baggage claim area is small... PIA ko chahiye kay apni service behtar karen.... ...
2885,4634,It was nice we were taking our first flight in a while so we didn't notice too much around the airport just waited that's all really. It all looked nice and comfortable. I am not sure about food and wifi and all that because we didn't use any of that so can't really comment but I am sure it would've been good.
2886,4635,"My LHE experience this time was much better then last time.Getting to the airport is easy, well because I live in DHA. To my surprise and delight there was no que to get inside international departures.Secondly the airport looked spacious thanks to the 1 man drop rule. Security check was organized and satisfying.Instead of 1 security counter working there were 3 which made things smooth and luggage instead of being scanned again after booking wasn't checked. It was collected at the weighing counter. The FIA officials were surprisngly polite. However the departure lounge was a bit disappointing, the air conditioning wasn't working perfectly and they had pedestal fans every where. The wifi was good. Overall this was my best experience at Lahore"
2887,4636,"Allama Iqbal International Airport is one of the Best Airport in the World, Providing Every Facilities to Passengers, And its Vistors, If you are Travelling to Lahore ,You will be lucky to Become a Part of this Beautiful City, It Provides Taxi/CaB service to Hotels ,Many Hotels Agents are there for Facilitating the International Passengers,If You WAnt to Reach the Allama Iqbal Airport From Any Part of Lahore and having issue to find Route You Must Call 1915 Traffic Police Help line to get Information."
2888,4637,Lahore airport is a beast airport in the world.Turkish airways inside environment is very relax able. the crew staff is very good. refreshment is not good but we suggest to Turkish airways service center please take action about refreshment matter. at last travel of Turkish airways is peace full for other airlines.I PROUD TO BE A PAKISTAN.
2889,4638,"Lahore airport in terms in facilities is good, however, behavior of Customs' official is worst as compared to other airports in Pakistan. They openly demand bribe and complaints to higher authorities in this regard are not addressed. Most of the departing passengers to Arab counties from this airport are mainly labor category and these Customs' official knew that whatever they can demand will be paid by these poor and illiterate guys.........."
2890,4640,"New Airport of Multan it have everything for city of 60 million people. It is superb.Multan International Airport is Very Very Excellent. New Terminal is awesome. Customs is friendly and do not make you panic. Runway is world class. Courteous staff and excellent atmosphere in lounge. Shop is not much expensive and as well as some Multani Cultural products are available. Some new restaurant were add like Pizza Hut, Subway, Dunkin' Donuts and McDonald's."
2891,4641,Multan International Airport is Very Very Excellent. New Terminal is awesome. Customs is friendly and do not make you panic. Runway is world class. Courteous staff and excellent atmosphere in lounge. Shop is not much expensive and have limited range of products available and as well as some Multani Cultural products are available.
2892,4642,Multan International Airport is Very Very Excellent. New Terminal is awesome. Customs is friendly and do not make you panic. Runway is world class. Courteous staff and excellent atmosphere in lounge. Shop is not much expensive and have limited range of products available and as well as some Multani Cultural products are available.
2893,4643,Good Air port. New Terminal is awesome. Good wifi. friendly and courteous staff and excellent atmosphere in lounge. Shop is not much expensive but have limited range of products available. Customs is friendly and do not make you panic. runway is world class.
2894,4644,"MBQ International is very very Nice World-Class Airport. Fast check-ins and security. Also immigration counters are well good in numbers. Wifi is also nice, Overall experience awesome. Eatery shops were also diverse and not very expensive."
2895,4645,Poor services in the airport. Has no variety and choice of food. Inhumane security checks. No wifi service.
2896,4646,I am going to Dubai today. I am hoping for prayers from all my friends. May Allah exalt our country so that we do not need to go to Dubai.
2897,4647,"love this airport. its my home town, i have requested flightradar24.com team to add this airport, they refused back then but finally the have added this airport to their website. i am grateful. i welcome all to the PEW airport and the city of Hospitality."
2898,4649,I just adore Peshawar its my home town and i want to keep going back there :( i miss going peshawar my aunty uncles live there :( The Airport is Very good!
2899,4650,Like it there my cousins and some family live there!
2900,4653,"Sialkot International Airport really world class. Fast check-ins and security. Also immigration counters are well good in numbers. Wifi is also nice, Overall experience awesome. Eatery shops were also diverse and not very expensive."
2901,4654,"Nice and clean Airport, EK check in staff was bit slow, FREE wifi A surprise and a delight. Everything smooth and quickoverall best experience i had at Pakistani Airport, ISB, LHE and KHI can learn a lot from SKT"
2902,4657,The best airport in Pakistan lovely staff and very helping customer service all over 5 *
2903,4661,"Terminal was very small and crowded, the only way of getting food was to buy them on a vending machine. Seating on the floor was the only option as there were three flights at the same time. The queues for boarding or checking in were very fast."
2904,4666,Very slow service at immigration. In generally staff at immigration and customs quite rude and arrogant.
2905,4667,"For a connection airport, Tocumen is easy and fast, but it demands some while to walk from one corner to another, specially if you arrive at terminal 2 and leave at terminal 1, or vice-versa. Copa Lounge is state-of-art, one of the best I've ever been to, but it lacks hot foods."
2906,4668,"For a connection airport, Tocumen is huge and it demands some time to walk from one corner to the other. For connecting flights, no immigration is needed, which makes everything easier and faster."
2907,4669,"They set up a security checkpoint at the gate, making everyone throw out their liquids. Pop up customs at the gate and lack of Wi-Fi are the worst and most annoying parts of connecting in Panama"
2908,4670,"We arrived as a connection flight, so the check-in process and the travel between Panama City to the airport was not realized. But the airport seems smaller that it really is, overcrowded and with lines in the bathrooms. Lack of signs to lounges"
2909,4671,"Since there was just the connection, we did not experience the city-to-airport public transportation nor the baggage claim. The airport is huge, but it seems small for the amount of passengers flying through it everyday. WiFi did not work well and lounge seemed overcrowded. Immigration process seemed prepared for the amount of foreigners arriving at the airport, but it could include bathrooms and more chairs on the process before customs."
2910,4672,"Nothing else to mention, the airport serves its passengers very well. As already mentioned: The new Copa lounge needs to improve only in terms of food."
2911,4673,"We use the new PTY terminal and the airport is excellent. Taking into account the volume of flights and passenger traffic it receives, there is nothing negative about it. The new Copa VIP Room is very beautiful and spacious, the only thing that leaves something to be desired is the small amount of snacks and food on offer, but otherwise, very good. The airport is well signposted and has good access. I really liked the PTY connection. All stages of boarding and disembarking have a part intended for customers with Elite status or traveling on business."
2912,4675,"Some workers did not know English, as as international airport this was quite unbecoming. The airport only grants 30mins of free wi-fi as well so be prepared."
2913,4677,"POM is getting the freshen up is so badly needed. The Check In is already improved dramatically and the new Paradise Lounge is now up there with other major airports. However, Customs/Immigration and Baggage Claim although having new facilities still suffers from lack of staff and a great deal of lost time and frustration can be experienced. Overall, a massive improvement but still plenty of room for improvement."
2914,4679,International is much better than domestic. Still pretty average.
2915,4687,"This is Peru’s second busiest airport yet its facilities are very poor. Much like Lima, there’s little terminal infrastructure for the number of flights and passengers, and the services are very poor for such a key tourist destination. The new Chinchero airport is set to bring relief"
2916,4688,"CUZ airport is a little too old and too small for a touristic city like Cusco. But as I understood, Peru is building a new one to serve the zone!"
2917,4690,"Little peruvian airport, with a lot of space to seat especially in the floor -1. There are also places where you can recharge your phone / laptop."
2918,4691,Nice small airport to arrive in. Short walk to baggage claim. Fast delivery. Taxix in plentiful supply
2919,4693,"Very old and small airport, I hope Perú build a new big airport for this important and beatiful city."
2920,4694,"No lounge, no wifi, few amenities of any kind. The ""boarding lounge"" is more of a holding pen, all flights seem to leave at the same time as well. Do NOT spend any extra time here, you'll be bored out of your mind at best."
2921,4695,"I guess it is too small to handle with the enormous amount of travellers that use it every day. People there still have dificulties of speaking in other language than spanish, luckly i am fluent, but i witnessed some hard situations between staff and users because of misunderstandings. There are a lot of taxis and the ride to Historic Center is short and cheap."
2922,4698,Its o good normal airport. Big but nothing compared to Guarulhos or Bogota for example. Tbe facilities are ok to get everything you need.
2923,4699,"Terminal capacity for domestic flights has become insufficient due to high volume of passengers (a healthy trend), too many people in little space, it is uncomfortable. The new terminal due Jan 2025 is arriving late but will be greatly welcome!"
2924,4700,"In general, it is an average airport. A little too small for Peru, as I feel. Only poor point is the access to it by public transport. Every local tells you, not to go out and take a city bus to Miraflores and so on. Nonetheless, I did that and the bus is ok but the surrounding streets of the airport should be improved."
2925,4702,"The internal courtyard of the airport is closed to Uber and taxis, you have to walk a long way or you are hostage to authorized companies. Staff service is excellent and very polite as in the rest of the country. Airport operation in general is efficient. No problems with the company, immigration, etc. Jorge Chavez (LIM) is the main Hub for Spanish America, together with Guarulhos in SP (GRU). Any product is very expensive, especially in the departure area. Luggage delivered without any conference, anyone can take your luggage and leave with it."
2926,4704,"Small international airport, clean and efficient for boarding. Full of services and not too crowded."
2927,4705,"45 minutes to get my luggage -.- And of course at the end there were no taxis left, at least the immigration did its job fast."
2928,4706,Long waiting at arrivals passport control. Quite scamy money exchange – better to use the national Bank at the back left side of the luggage hall. Good navigation and orientation in the building. Great WiFi.
2929,4712,Quite far from Manila. Currently not much to do at the airport while waiting for your flight as most food and retail areas are still closed. The terminal itself is quite modern and spacious.
2930,4713,"Speedy security check and check in for a night departure, although 2 flights to Seoul where scheduled for the same time. Very few facilities and the lounge is more like a seating hall with better AC and some free food and drinks, but not more. OK for a 30 minutes wait and refreshment but avoid it if you have to wait for longer time."
2931,4715,"Small airport, excellent wifi (was able to watch an entire series in Netflix), however, there are not a lot of boutiques and food stalls. Slightly disappointing, but arrival was quickly handled."
2932,4716,"Keep in mind that: 1) in Angles you cannot just hail a trike/jeepney/taxi on the street. You either need to order it in advance, or go to certain stops and formally place your order. Otherwise, you will fly by, like we did in our time... 2) If you do fly by, then it is better not to waste time on booking via the Internet (at least we were so “lucky” that online sales were closed for our day), and find the ticket office and stubbornly wait for the cashier, who is extremely rarely and reluctantly there... 3) international flights take a hellishly long and bureaucratic check. It’s better to arrive very early... 3) the smoking room with Wi-Fi and free cookies/drinks is located in the paid lounge area on the second floor. 4) keep in mind that Clark Airport in Angeles City and Ninoy Aquino Airport in Manila are two big differences (almost 100 km away), although some sellers labeled them as simply Manila"
2933,4719,"The airport is clean and the security check was fast, the check in staff was kind and helpfull but the food and the beverages are expensive, the airport wifi is fast."
2934,4720,The New Bacolod-Silay Intl Airport can accomdate an Airbus A330 and 5 planes can park at the tarmac of this airport.The runway length of the Airport is 2000 m or 2 km. The biggest plane that landed in this airport is the C-17 Globemaster.
2935,4721,"Getting to the airport is very convenient. Just PHP10 for a multicab (small jeepney) on Route 2 from the city. The drop off point is less than 200 meters to the terminal. Terminal is undergoing renovation, so the facade is blocked from view but there are signs to follow. Inside, the pre-departure area is fairly clean and bright, due to a recent renovation. Unfortunately there is a dearth of food outlets, the only store sells ""pasalubong"" and drinks, but no hot meals. Lounge seems non-existent but let's see once the renovation is complete. Checkin is kinda slow, and passengers don't follow the proper lines (special for seniors, PWD, etc. vs for all economy pax). But the staff are eager to serve and help. Overall, a lot of improvement can be expected once traffic to BXU picks up to pre-pandemic levels."
2936,4722,"You can hop in from City Downtown to Butuan Bancasi Airport by means of multicab, the fare is 15 pesos"
2937,4723,"An improvements in the baggage carousel, comfort rooms are now bigger and very clean. Lounges for breast feedings and VIP are in place already."
2938,4724,"I see improvements little by little, keep it up RPME... Hope next time you will have jet bridge soon :-) ......The Comfort Rooms/ Toilet are clean and big............................................................................................................................."
2939,4725,"Flight to CDO was very smooth. Our gate did not have a direct jetway to the terminal so we had to disembark via stairs, even though all 3 jetways were empty, as in we were the only aircraft there. No food or retail services at the arrival area. Terminal restrooms were well maintained. Immigration and Customs were very unprepared, long lines, and very unprepared agents. Wi-Fi at the airport is only available for 30 minutes, unreliable and slow. Baggage claim was okay, as there are people who help you get your bags from the baggage claim area. Private vans and taxis are available outside as transportation."
2940,4726,National Highway-Airport road has many holes on the road. They turn off the National Highway-Airport road lights even if it is solar-powered. Small airport but great for domestic travel. Little food retail options. Small baggage claim.
2941,4727,The app should change the airport name since Cagayan de Oro's airport is known as the Laguindingan Airport RPMY
2942,4728,"Baggage handling; the baggage carousel needs fixing! it is so slow and sometimes when there are too many bags, it just simply stopped..."
2943,4729,This wasnt that lumbia airport. It was new ladinguan airport but flightdiary doesn't yet have that on it's lists. Someday future this airport will be international airport. But that is still quite far away. But it have already Ladinguan international airpot name. :)
2944,4731,"CGY-Laguindingan is a new airport. Like any other new airport, it is still undergoing transformation. Very Far from Cagayan de Oro and somewhat more friendly to Iligan in terms of Distance. Very small, with some stalls opening up. I am sure it will be a good airport once all of the improvements are in place..."
2945,4733,"The departure terminal is good and airconditioned. Airport is so strict, why did they have to confiscate my lighter?"
2946,4734,"The arrival terminal building looks like a bus station. No AC, it’s literally like a small bus station."
2947,4737,"I was only in the arrivals area, but I found it to be the most modern of the airports I was in in the Philippines."
2948,4738,"This was a domestic flight so I was in Terminal 1 and overall, it was a good experience! Terminal 1 had been undergoing renovations and there are visible improvements to attest to that! More shops / restos (although notably, Jollibee was closed so I was not able to get my Chickenjoy breakfast). Better restrooms. For Wi-Fi, I did not check since I was on mobile data. And I flew early in the morning so there wasn't so much travel chaos yet."
2949,4739,Great airport and many souvenir shops. Beautiful architectural design for the international terminal but not for the domestic terminal. Check-in was so fast since it is online. Wifi is average. Many food retail options. Lounge is beautiful for the international terminal but not for the domestic terminal.
2950,4740,Great architectural design airport. Pleasant and peacful lounge with great view of aircrafts. Many fast food options. Fast immigration declaration. Baggage claim area is well organized.
2951,4742,Everything was good. The only concern I have is with the ceilings of the arrivals area or the baggage carousels. Seem dirty and used. Otherwise pretty great.
2952,4743,If not given on plane - need 2 forms .. Customs and Immigration .. we were only given customs after coming off plane .. when got to immigration had to re-queue
2953,4744,Mactan-Cebu is the best airport in the Philippines. Manila may be bigger but it also extremely overcapacity and very poorly managed. CEB also doesn't have any scams going on like MNL does so you are much safer. CEB is actually being improved as time goes on whereas MNL is quite literally falling to bits due to shoddy construction work.
2954,4745,So far easily best international airport what Philippines have to offer. Manila NAIA airport is so awfull compared to this airport. Future when I go Philippines I will always use this airport. Fast and easy airport to use.
2955,4750,"Airport is not bad compared to other Philippine airports. Small and not many facilities, but it is developing."
2956,4751,"only taxis to the airport, but in Davao everything is so much nicer than in other parts of the country."
2957,4752,"DVO is slowly evolving into an international airport, currently this Tigerair flight is one of a few. Not many food or retail stores yet open, WiFi very unreliable and slow. Checkin was efficient, I am very unhappy about the many unnecessary, because absolutely inefficient security checks. Pay attention: DVO terminal tax 200PHP/national, 700PHP international departures."
2958,4753,"The airport is small, but comfortable inside and has fast check-in and security check procedures. Also baggage claim is fast. There is enough sitting space at the gates and has a very good Wi-Fi coverage. Though, on my 4th time being in this airport, the Wi-Fi was not working and all schedule screens and information displays at Check-In counters were turned off."
2959,4754,"they need to fix the wifi but overall, this airport is way better than NAIA and Cebu in the Philippines Iloilo comes close (the major drawback of Iloilo is it is just too far from the City). I hope it stays that way."
2960,4755,Security personnel were eating while having some security check.
2961,4759,"The security check process was smooth. However, the check-in point doesn't have enough chairs to cater the passengers while waiting for the check-in to commence. The waiting area was also congested; lacking of chairs."
2962,4760,"The airport is fine,not much to do except drink some coffee,eat,and have a short massage.The ride from Rizal Blvd was about 20m. What i mostly did was just watch some Youtube."
2963,4762,"A small airport. Security check is fairly painless. The pre-departure area is okay, there is a Bo's Coffee and a stall selling snacks and rice meals inside. Toilets are fairly clean."
2964,4763,Small airport. Less space. Blind man playing guitar and gibin massage for small money. Gettingntonthe airport per motor tricycle.
2965,4764,short ways
2966,4765,Simple yet clean airport
2967,4770,aww.ok lang
2968,4772,Terminal 3: Plenty of choices of restaurants. No floor plan in the terminal. Not so many restaurants accept card payment. Some ATM are out of cash. Toilets are messy.
2969,4774,We were delayed for two hours and there's not enough chairs to cater the passengers. We had problems during the self check-in. The airport was overly congested.
2970,4775,Not bad from what I saw. Pleasant immigration officer. Decent baggage claim even with a longer wait than usual. Easy getting a grab to my hostel.
2971,4779,"[KR] 저희가 터미널 1로 내렸습니다. 일단 터미널 1은 지어진지가 오래되었다보니 조금 시설이 안좋았습니다. 시내로 나가는쪽도 조금 더러운 느낌이 들었습니다. 악취도 나고요 (당시 밤, 비가 왔던 상황) 하지만 출발동은 깨끗하더라구요? 도착동만 그랬던 거였습니다. 와이파이에 관해서 이야기 하자면 진짜 얍삽합니다. 하루에 몇시간동안 쓸수 있습니다. 다쓰면 시즌이 끝났다 라고 말하며 와이파이가 끊겨버리죠. [EN] We got off at Terminal 1. First of all, Terminal 1 was built a long time ago, so the facilities were a little bad. It felt a little dirty on the way out to the city. It stinks. But the starting building is clean? It was only the arrival building. When it comes to Wi-Fi, it's really sneaky. You can use it for hours a day. When I finish writing, I say the season is over, and the Wi-Fi gets cut off."
2972,4781,Manila Airport was an ok experience the check in was decent.Lounge was alright also the staff were helpful.
2973,4783,"The airport was very good overall, but there where only five stores and no lounges. There was also no wifi at all."
2974,4785,"overcrowded departure area, no shops"
2975,4790,"Great little airport, easy to get to by bus number (80). Free Wi-Fi. Quick inspection and passport control. There are enough shops and cafes nearby. The airport is very clean and has many toilets."
2976,4791,Amatoren.
2977,4795,"Pretty good, checkin was rather swift and most of the staff were nice. The food here is pretty expensive, though, and getting to the toilets is way more of a hassle than it should be."
2978,4796,"Great airport. It's small but has everything you need. well communicated from the center. No crowds, everything goes super fast and smooth."
2979,4797,Non Schengen arrivals & passport controls are Absolutley gorgeous the new digital scanners get you through the control in 1min. 10/10
2980,4798,"The airport is ok, although the immigration was very slow. Wi-Fi works well, I know it because I'm from Gdynia (a city near Gdańsk)."
2981,4799,"This is very modern and cute airport - without any problems with service,lounge zone, information windows,all services of airport!! - we have got very pleasure to be in the Gdansk airport!!"
2982,4800,Dx4zex4e4xxexc4exx4rxx4xrxc4xxe4exx4ex4xdx4xxex4dt x x xxr dcerxdctxd txdctx dtx dtx dtxd txd tdx tdt xxe r Good airport
2983,4801,"Small regional airport. I don't know why, but I had to wait around 30 minutes on the baggage claim. I also didn't saw any customs, lol."
2984,4802,"Security check is horrible. You have to take all the electronics out of the bag, I even had to lift my shirt so they could check I wasn't carrying any 'explosives', it looks like pre-war equipment."
2985,4807,"The queue to the registration deck was quite long for a small airport. WiFi was unstable and dropping a lot. Passport control on arrival was annoingly slow. The choice of food services is good, as well historical information around the airport."
2986,4809,"Tricky access to the airport from the city. Terminal A is pretty tight, if you have a longer wait time, it's better to sit down in T2."
2987,4811,"Even though a part of the airport is closed due to COVID-19, it is still friendly and pretty easy to fly from. Unlike other airports, security check is performed in a quick and efficient manner with smile. The business lounge is small, but sufficient for a limited number of flights."
2988,4815,Free water stations both out of operation after security so if you want water you need to pay an excessively high rate for it.
2989,4816,Very rude people at security check refusing to speak english when checking arms with stripes. No soap at the toilet.
2990,4817,"Very nice terminal, the check-in and security wasnt the best, not many stores after and before check-in."
2991,4818,Love this airport it's so nice and easy to get through. Not a massive airport but big enough and very clean too
2992,4819,"The Check-In Ground Staff (Wellcome Airport Services) had a very mean and unprofessional attitude, especially considering that it was the check-in lane for business class passengers and frequent flyer passengers. However, the other aspects of the airport were quite good."
2993,4822,"Removing a half-hour limit on WiFi would be really nice; other than that, no complaints whatsoever - everything was quick and smooth."
2994,4824,"A small airport given the huge number of passengers. Easy access by train, not far away from the center. The facilities are a few, and the food is really expensive here."
2995,4825,First of all: AMAZING terminal building. It looks beautiful. Walk from plane to bus stop in front of terminal takes like 2 or 3 minutes (I had only hand luggage). Only weak point of this airport is little number of directions.
2996,4826,"It's a very small airport with few amenities, but it's also not the kind of airport where people spend a lot of time in. You're either arriving or departing, and it's to one of a few select cities. The people are fairly friend at Lodz Airport, and will do their best to help you out, even if you speak English and they're not great at it. The bus is a very short walk and the stops are announced, albeit in Polish."
2997,4828,Very nice airport. The terminal is brand new one. It is small however comfortable and functional.
2998,4830,"Very small. Waiting hall sometimes overcrowded, boarding process is annoying. Transportation is not bad."
2999,4831,The old terminal was really terrible but apparently they opened the new one which I am looking forward to visit.
3000,4834,Nice airport. Free WiFi. A new superb terminal will be opened within a few weeks.
3001,4835,"Other than getting to the airport and poor wi-fi quality, airport experience was pretty smooth. For a small regional airport facilities are very good and the whole check-in, security and boarding process is well organized."
3002,4836,"Tiny airport, the smoking cube is in the middle and sometimes you could be hit with the smoke, not so much of duty free/coffee shops, but overall it was quick and efficient."
3003,4839,"I've travelled from/to LUZ many times, and so far I don't have any complaints. Getting to Lublin from different parts of the world is so much easier, due to many convenient connections. The staff was friendly, and the security control professional. The terminal, however really needs expanding, which I hope will happen soon. Overall experience - really positive."
3004,4840,"Airport is nice, the only problem was with security check - it was too much exact. They were checking all bags twice, they made a mess in my things. Never saw something like this."
3005,4841,Born and raised in Lublin. Traveled around the world but this airport is the worst I have ever visited! Security check are crazy and unpleasant. I never had check like this before nowhere else in the world been asked to take of my shoes etc.
3006,4842,Excellent little airport with everything you need - even a train that connects it to the city and stops right in the terminal building! Not too many shops but that's expected since this a pretty small airport that just recently opened.
3007,4843,"The best airport in East Poland, everything is close at hand. Airpot is close to beautiful medieval Lublin downtown (about 20 minutes ride) with many transport options (city bus, shuttle bus, taxi and train arriving directly from airpot terminal to Lublin main station). Airport is near Lublin expressway bypass. Terminal is clean&cosy, customs is trouble-free and service is very helpful. Airport gets new routes every year (Wizzair base from September 2015). Keep it up Lublin!"
3008,4844,"Airport OK, just like in Lublin. Both Rzeszów and Lublin are very nice cities and have nice airports. I give 5 stars to both Rzeszów and Lublin. This is because some anti-Lublin people wrote such opinions that it is better not to quote them. I think they are irresponsible and I apologize as a resident of Rzeszów for their behavior (I guess they are some idiots from Rzeszów and also have no brains). Rzeszów greets Lublin"
3009,4846,"Small airport but cosy, easy to locate everything. Security was fast but workers looked a little lost. Gates were clean"
3010,4847,"Very nice and fast service, worth recommending. There are many buses going to the airport, so access is perfect. I have no complaints about the rest of the things."
3011,4851,"A medium-sized airport, it is pleasant to go through security, but there are long queues, after the security check you are not forced to enter Duty Free during holidays, there are significant delays"
3012,4852,"Very long check. When 3 flights are placed side by side, a collapse occurs."
3013,4856,"Small airport located near enough to the motorway. A few shops, but most were closed at the moment, however there's a great viewing deck upstairs"
3014,4858,"It's a very small regional airport but it's clean, modern and offers some inexpensive food :) Getting to the city is not easy though, best to take a taxi."
3015,4859,"A modern airport, close to the center of Rzeszów. Free parking and a viewing terrace. 3 levels. Service without reservations."
3016,4860,"Nice, modern airport. 8 km from the center of Rzeszów. Free parking, fast and efficient service. Free observation deck."
3017,4861,"My hometown airport... Getting better and better with every year, but still plenty things have to be done. Public transport is poor and still too little connections, a few flight everyday, it's not enough. Anyway terminal is small and beautiful, not so crowdy, good service. Recommend to fly from here."
3018,4862,"Rzeszow is my favorite airport and the city. The modern terminal, the city center about 7 kilometers. Friendly service, good connections."
3019,4863,A modern 3-level terminal with a viewing terrace. Close to the center of Rzeszów. Service without reservations. Free parking.
3020,4864,"Modern Rzeszów airport. Close to the city center. 3rd floor, observation deck, shops, carrier services in the terminal. A lot of flights for a regional airport. Free parking and friendly service for travelers"
3021,4865,"Nice, modern international airport in Rzeszów. Close to the center of Rzeszów, free parking. You can eat or buy something in the terminal. The service was impeccable. A very nice airport and even a lot of international flights."
3022,4866,"A regional airport with bad public transport connections, it's recommended to come by car. Fast security check, the staff were kind. Wi-fi free for 60 mins (after answering 2 questions, about gender and age range), you can re-use it after 60 mins again. One small duty-free shop with wide range of fragnance and small choice of daily use things such as OTC meds and drinks. Before my flight at 8 there were more than enough seats at the gate available, even if plane was 90% full."
3023,4868,"Small airport, half of the line for the border control had to stand outside of the building when it was freezing. Everything else was pleasant and ok."
3024,4871,Nice airport :)
3025,4873,Cool
3026,4875,"Very, very small but nice and efficient. Far away from downtown Szczecin."
3027,4877,"Liked it. Was really nice. The announcements sounded really weird because they are AI, but the whole airport is actually pretty nice and counfy."
3028,4878,"Very nice airport with a bunch of food options. If you are going from the domestic section to the international section it is very complicated and hard to navigate, but once you get past that part, it will be a breeze to navigate."
3029,4879,"Airport isn't comfortable for travelers: there are not enough seats for passengers, the seats are metal and it isn't comfortable to sit on them, there are big windows without a shadow (on a sunny day you get well-done), big lines for transfer between Schengen and Non-Schengen zone, only a few points for charging devices."
3030,4880,"Airport isn't comfortable for travelers: there are not enough seats for passengers, the seats are metal and it isn't comfortable to sit on them, there are big windows without a shadow (on a sunny day you get well-done), big lines for transfer between Schengen and Non-Schengen zone, only a few points for charging devices."
3031,4881,"Chopin airport (arrivals part) has all facilities that are needed. I have no idea about the baggage claim, I didn't check baggage for at least 10 years now. :) Only big minus for my last flight: bus transfer to the terminal in bad weather after a transatlantic flight - that's poor."
3032,4882,"Warsaw Chopin airport is conveniently located and has all facilities that are needed. The departure area for non-Schengen destinations is a bit tight, though and can get pretty busy. There is also just one little cafe there."
3033,4884,"The Warsaw Chopin airport is pretty good actually. I had almost no bad experiences with this airport. You have tons of ways to get to the airport, most importantly the regional train which is cheap and gets you to the center of Warsaw in like 15 mins. There are also city buses that go to the airport terminal. The terminal has lots of shops in the Shengen area how ever in the non Shengen area there are very little facilites. Only a few shops and cafes. The airport wifi is ok and theres nothing wrong with it. Its just a little slow. The security and check in are very solid. The check in line can be quite long sometimes how ever it goes by fast if you aren't flying charter. The security is really good. It goes by at moderate speeds (5-10 Mins if theres a lot of people) and the staff is super nice and helpful. The lounge i can't personally rate becouse i haven't been in it. How ever i heard some pretty good things about the lounge. Overall the Warsaw Chopin airport it slightly above average and in some cases really good. So in my opinion it deserves 4 stars."
3034,4886,Small airport that is often overcrowded and does not have very many food options and always overcrowded boarding area.
3035,4887,The staff was not the kindest but all the other fascilities were almost perfect. The food and drinks were good!
3036,4896,"Small airport, cozy, no rush, everything was on time. Security check was more detailed than in Wroclaw. Fun fact: you can get to Radom airport by feet"
3037,4897,"15 minutes away from city center, short checkin and no security lines as it's not served by many airlines yet. Compact airport. Free tea and coffee as no retail is open. Good quality WiFi, security a bit too throural"
3038,4898,"The fastest airport in Poland ;) It would be enough to show up even 30 minutes before departure. There were 6 people on the flight with me. Everything happened quickly, so the closed service premises can be forgiven. Nice atmosphere, I felt like I was flying on my private jet ;) I recommend it!"
3039,4899,"I was on a flight to Warsaw. I got onto a bus 106 that drove me to the airport. I have check-in 24h before my flight. Security was ok. Terminal was new so it was cool for me, but i don,t who for others. Lounge cost about 129 zł and it was ok there. Food is expensive like on other airports. Wifi was also ok. I really like this airport because it's close to my house in Wrocław and it's new."
3040,4900,Very good airport. Everything goes quick and there are almost never delays. You can buy food at almost every corner and there is enough space for everyone to sit.
3041,4901,"Very easy to get to the centre, although immigration was very slow. Staff were looking at every stamp in the passport."
3042,4902,"got to the airport via bus from the main train station which took approx. 45 mins to get to the airport. was surprised by how small and quiet the airport was. took about 10 minutes to get through security, weren't many shops in the airport but that didn't really matter."
3043,4903,"Access to the city by bus, large parking lot: PLN 20 per day. Lots of check-in stations. Security check was quick, but only three counters (one VIP). Free Wi-Fi throughout the airport. One restaurant, several shops and two gate bars."
3044,4904,"Because I arrived at night, the airport wasn't that busy. Border clearance went really fast and so did baggage claim. The architecture and design of the airport itself was really nice."
3045,4905,"Good, regional airport, clean, there is a free water fountain after security checks. Good communication with the city centre"
3046,4906,"Liked this airport very much for its transparency. It's easy and fast to move around, also clean and offers good connection to city centre."
3047,4909,"Decent municipal airport, nothing more, nothing less. Very friendly staff even during coronavirus crisis. You can buy a cup of coffee or a snack. Weird to hear radio inside."
3048,4911,"The little one is an airport, it's a pity that there are no more flights, but it is peaceful. Very intimate. There is no rush or pushing. It's a bit reminiscent of the atmosphere from the series ""Alaska Stop""."
3049,4912,"small, nice airport"
3050,4914,nice service at the bus station and at the airport
3051,4919,"FAO is a nice modern building and I have seen it being refurbished and extended over the past few years. However, the WiFi is diabolical and I’ve never been able to connect to it. There is a nice calm ambience about the place but, the lounge has consistently been poor and on this trip it was overcrowded, understaffed and unclean. Used crockery was everywhere and the was next to nothing to eat other than a few bits of fruit and some very sorry looking sandwiches. The WiFi was poor in here too although it’s fair to say that in the past it has been adequate. I was grouchy anyway but, having to spend time “relaxing” in an atmosphere that was anything but whilst waiting for my slightly delayed flight really did nothing to lighten my mood. Vinci Airports really must try a lot harder."
3052,4920,"Give duty-free a miss. The lounge can be bustling. Leave enough time to clear both security and immigration; queues can be long, especially when several flights are leaving for the UK at similar time. Gates can be confusing."
3053,4921,"Small yet popular, busy airport easy to get through. No delays at either end quicker than UK airports"
3054,4922,I thought it is like your average airport there is nothing to special about it but passport check and check-in did take quite a while
3055,4923,"Security goes fast, after security nothing much to do and barely place to sit. Overall good airport to travel from"
3056,4924,",..............................................................................................................................."
3057,4925,"Due to COVID-19, not much was open at the airport. The only place to get food airside was Burger King. Sadly there was no Wi-Fi at the airport."
3058,4927,A bit chaotic airport. Gate numbers are confusing and my gate number was given just 10 minutes prior to boarding the plane. Not a lot of shops. Check-in was taking way too long for just a short waiting line.
3059,4931,"The airport is pretty small so its hard to get lost in there. After seurity check, there is still chance to smoke since there is a ballcony that is like a smoking area. Staff there all normal and nice so I rate it 10/10"
3060,4932,We had 4am departure to Lisbon. It was pheaseble to spend the night on the airport and kids had somehow good sleep in provided kids carrier. Only disadvatntage was that they need to see all passangers during check-in which unfortunatelly made kids awake.
3061,4933,"From rentalcar to the gate, 15 min. Can't be more efficient than that ! :) Plus : open terrace with runway view"
3062,4934,"Would 100% recommend the viewing terrace outside. Called a smoking area, but very few are smoking and 90% of people and watching the pilots struggle to land in the harsh crosswinds!"
3063,4935,"Funchal airport is full of ""mystery"" due to the ""complicated"" approach. In any case, we had a peaceful landing by airport standards. The arrival and departure view is incredible."
3064,4936,"The Airport is ""terrifying"" due to its fame but we had a good take off from it. The view is incredible right after taking off."
3065,4937,Reasonably priced cabs to and from the airport. Check-in/baggage drop opened late due to late incoming flight. Good viewing platforms on land-side (free) and air-side. Food outlets cheaper on land-side.
3066,4938,"Check-in didn't take too long even though there were a number of Jet2 flights leaving around the same time I mine. This was peak time for holiday flight departures and the airport was showing the strain. The security queue started at the top of the escalator and doubled back on itself. Progress was tedious and annoying as it was slow and I kept getting bumped and nudged. I lost track of the number of times that I swiped away from my boarding pass as a result. There were a number of flights delayed by a long time which meant that the departures lounge was crowded. The eatery that I visited was working at capacity and the food took a little longer to come that it normally would. All of the seats at the gate were taken, but not long after I arrived, someone decided that it was time to queue to board and the sheep followed, freeing up many seats."
3067,4939,"Arriving domestically from PDL, I bypassed immigration and headed straight to baggage reclaim, where the baggage started arriving pretty quickly. I had some time to kill, so took the lift up to the observation deck, got something to eat and drink from the restaurant and enjoyed the view. It was pretty wind and there is little shelter from the wind or the sun. There is also a left luggage service."
3068,4940,"I just had a stopover, so was directed from the aircraft in to the departure gate. The lounge is spacious enough for the number of passengers. There are few facilities. For food, there is a vending machine offering hot and cold drinks and snacks."
3069,4941,Just a stopover. I disembarked and was lead straight to the transit door which leads straight in to the departure gate. There is a vending machine in the departure lounge. The turnaround was quick and I was back on the aircraft with no problems. I found the WiFi to be good at all of the airports operated by ANA.
3070,4942,Very nice airport. On the roof i enjoyed an awesome Peter's Gin Tonic with a beautifull view wether to the ocean and Pico Island or to the plane's handling...
3071,4943,Very clean and nice airport. On the balcony you can see dolphins and whales in the sea nearby. Very fast luggage delivery . It is usual baggage that circulates on the belt when passengers arrive in the room.
3072,4945,"Grat international airport! Getting the airport is very easy, wifi is free with good signal, a small bar/restaurant to take lunch with quality and very good food, baggagem claim very fast, when we arrived the luggage was already on the belt and have a small store for souveneirs. Good view of the balcony, can see dolphins an pico island in front."
3073,4946,Very clean and nice airport. On the balcony you can see dolphins and whales in the sea nearby. Very fast luggage delivery . It is usual baggage that circulates on the belt when passengers arrive in the room.
3074,4948,Very clean and nice airport. On the balcony you can see dolphins and whales in the sea nearby. Very fast luggage delivery . It is usual baggage that circulates on the belt when passengers arrive in the room.
3075,4950,"You should put some water fountains in this airport. When you connect and need to go through security at LIS, it would be great to refill water in the bottles."
3076,4951,"Very organised airport, I haven't seen such professional staff elsewhere and the cleanliness level was on top. Again, the airport is well connected to the city centre and impresses you by its overall great functionality, having a great duty free selection and also beeing a big hub for the America's, Africa and the rest of Europe. I really loved this airport and country and hope to come back soon!"
3077,4952,"Breathtaking landing into Lisbon, organised means of transportation out of the airport, welcoming staff!"
3078,4953,"Getting to the airport is generally really crowded by car. You can only avoid this if getting on some crazy off-peak hour. The security is fine, though I prefer T2 to T1, in this aspect, as the X-rays are more advanced and mean more straightforward procedure. The facilities on T1 are decent, while on T2 all the terminal feels cramped and quite reduced, not good for the amount of demand seen. For the rest, it is quite a standard experience. Positive points to toilet cleaning, they are generally quite well looked after."
3079,4954,"It's under construction, so it looks a little rough. There aren't many food options, and the international terminal is not good."
3080,4955,I don't love the airport. I was in the foreign departures terminal and it was very dated without many amenities.
3081,4958,Fast security in Terminal 2 but very slow passport control and no seating in waiting area. As usual Ryanair had everyone checked early but everyone standing waiting to board
3082,4960,"A single, very basic building with a very small waiting room. The flight board was not working during my visit. The worst factor is the presence of a bar outside the boarding area. The (kind) security guards allowed us to go back to buy a bottle of water which we obviously had to finish going back to the waiting room and going through the checks again. It's not very busy so checks are quick. Bathrooms a little dirty. However, everything is bearable just to visit this beautiful island."
3083,4961,"PIX is my temporary home airport. For the Dash inter-island service check-in, security and boarding is quick. It might take a little longer for the flights to Portugal mainland with bigger aircrafts. Food and retail services are limited, but not really needed because you usually do not have to spend too much time at the airport. WiFi is free, fast and stable connections."
3084,4962,"Excellent airport with a very beautiful view over the mountains and the islands of Faial and Sao Jorge, has free wifi, the conditions offered to passengers are very good, the bathrooms are very clean and the luggage service is impeccable."
3085,4964,"Small regional airport with international aspirations. Medium wi-fi, no lounge, no smoking area, no duty-free but very easy through check-in, security check and boarding. All this with a spectacular view of the highest mountain in Portugal."
3086,4966,"Nice airport! WiFi Free at all airport, good food and retail services. The location of airport is a very beautifull because you can see Pico Mountain and Faial and São Jorge islands Baggage claim very efficient."
3087,4967,Need more flights to Pico! The airport has regular connections with Lisbon via TAP Portugal once a week(saturdays) and a second connection in July and August at Wednesday. The airport has 2 inter-island flights per day to Ponta Delgada (São Miguel-Azores) and Lages(Terceira-Azores) with Sata.
3088,4969,"Airport small enough, well organized and clean. The bar a little expensive. The very comfortable relaxation area with working electrical sockets."
3089,4970,"Ponta Delgada airport is tiny and lacks direct options to the city, even though it is ""next door"". It ends up being necessary to order a taxi which always increases the cost for the traveler."
3090,4971,"During my time on the island, I don't recall seeing the airport bus or any other buses. I was quite happy to walk. I had checked-in online, but there is no separate bag drop, so I had to join the check-in queue. It was quite long, but ahead of me was a boys football team and they all went to check-in together. It ended up not being too long and neither was the security check. I'm still not a fan of the departures lounge, which I think is too small."
3091,4972,With just hand baggage I had no issues passing through the airport. The is a good range of shops on the concourse and a restaurant which is good enough.
3092,4973,"I checked-in online and was travelling with just a backpack, so I headed straight to security. Security was no a problem. The departures lounge is quite small and easily crowded. There are few food and retail options airside. The signage is a little confusing. The domestic gates are 1 to 5 and are all accessed via the same entrance, but this is not made clear. The sign for gates 1 to 5 points away from this entrance. Boarding was quick and easy. The WiFi signal is really good."
3093,4974,"Arriving on a domestic flight, I passed through the airport quickly with no issues. The concourse is large and spacious with shops and a food outlet. Don't miss the impressive hanging model of the historical NC3 aircraft. The WiFi is very good. I was staying halfway between the airport and the town centre. There are public transport options, but I don't know how frequent or reliable it is. I had time to kill before I was able to check-in to my accommodation, so I decided to walk. The road gives great views over the runway. It is an easy walk, but some parts of the pavement are not perfect for wheeled luggage."
3094,4975,"When we arrived at the airport flight was shown as departing earlier than originally scheduled (7:55 instead of 8:30). Then it showed up as ""Delayed 8:30"". Lots of people and long waiting times at check-in (although all of them were staffed). Everything went okay, but the communication could have been better (PA announcements)."
3095,4976,"Well, i lived on Ponta Delgada my entire life. It is a beautiful city, not that big, in a beautiful island. This airport got a easy acess, by car, bus ir even on foot."
3096,4977,"Cozy little airport, well-organized, friendly, not far from the town. My husband and I even walked to Ponta Delgada."
3097,4978,"For such a small island it's a very decent airport. Clean and pleasant, Strong wifi signal, good choice of rental cars outside, nice shopping choices inside (local delicacies), reasonable prices. Staff speaks english, is proffessional and helpful"
3098,4981,"Porto Airport, also known as Francisco Sá Carneiro Airport, has several areas that could benefit from improvements to enhance the passenger experience. One of the primary concerns is the security check process. Currently, passengers are required to remove electronic devices from their bags and place them in separate trays for X-ray scanning. This procedure often leads to delays, discomfort, and the formation of long queues. Many modern airports have adopted advanced 3D X-ray technology, which allows for faster and more precise screening without the need to remove electronics from bags. Unfortunately, Porto Airport, much like Lisbon Airport, has yet to implement such technology, a change that would greatly improve efficiency and passenger convenience. Another significant issue is the limited operating hours of shops and services at the airport. Most facilities close after 10 PM and do not reopen until 5 or 6 AM the following day. This can be particularly inconvenient for passengers with very early morning flights or those arriving late at night. There are limited options for dining, shopping, or even waiting comfortably during these hours. The situation is further exacerbated by the restricted hours of the airport's only VIP lounge, which does not offer extended service to accommodate these passengers. Extending the operating hours of the VIP lounge, at least, would provide a much-needed amenity for travelers during these off-peak times. In summary, while Porto Airport provides a functional and generally satisfactory experience, there are key areas, notably in security screening and facility operating hours, where improvements could significantly enhance the overall experience for travelers."
3099,4982,"Best International Airport in Portugal, quick check-in procedures same as the security lines, good selection of food and retail, in the only bad thing that can be seen at this airport are the boarding areas for low cost carries that need more seating options and a slow and difficult to acces WI-FI. Overall a great airport."
3100,4983,"The connection from the highway to the airport is really good, the WiFi is good for reading ebooks, texting and FlightRadar24. The WiFi is slow and choppy for streaming purposes. The food is easily acessible after security with a nice duty-free. The Lounge is spetacular. Immigration is a breeze, it's very quick and effective. Baggage claim may be slow and may take a while but is easily accessible and from baggage claim to the exit is a short 3 minute walk. Terminal is well decorated with a lot of beautiful ways to see the planes landing. The terminal itself is a good place to planespot."
3101,4984,"Positive points: -Getting to the airport (metro, bus, car) -Fast security check -organization on the low cost terminal Negative points: -Small Terminal -High prices -Only two food options in the lounge -The staff don't speak good English -Bad quality wifi"
3102,4985,"In the low-cost after passing the gate, we must wait in queue outside the terminal building and walk to airplane, so we must be prepared to cold and rain."
3103,4986,"Very easy to get to and from as the metro is connected to the airport. Immigration can be quick but it depends on the day. Security lines can be a pain at early hours as most flights depart from 6 to 8 AM, come early and prepared. There is fast track service but people do not know they must purchase the pass online or fly business class."
3104,4987,Good experience from check-in and security. Decent restaurants and shops available. Quick bus from boarding gate straight to plane.
3105,4988,Arrival in the morning at Porto. Good arrivals journey through passport control and through to the trams towards the city centre.
3106,4991,"Nice fast checking, Fast security, fast boarding etc. Airport was renovated a few years ago so its much nicer now & some food options inside or across the street."
3107,4992,"Overall great airport, It was renovated a few years back so its much nicer now (but still small) a few options for food in the airport or you can go across the street to grab something a bit cheaper. Baggage Claim was good to, slightly slower but not a big deal."
3108,4994,"Small and military airport with a military infrastructure, not a big terminal or luxurious but simple and easy. Big runway, the biggest in Portugal, and excellent ways to get to the airport and to get to the island."
3109,4995,"The airport is small but efficient! I liked the quickly check-in and boarding too... However, the security check it's a little bit slow for a international airport... The wifi connection was awseome! I had a positive impression of Lajes Airport!"
3110,4996,"The airport is small but efficient! I liked the quickly check-in and boarding too... The wifi connection was awseome! However, the security check it's a little bit slow for a regional airport... However, I have a positive impression of Lajes Airport."
3111,4997,The check-in it was very fast and the boarding two.
3112,5000,"This is an outstanding airport, you actually save hundreds of dollars of your area a smoker or a drinker, cigarettes and alcohol are tax free and also the colognes and perfumes are really cheap and top of the line brands, love shopping here, don't key me start about the food! Outstanding restaurants like metropol,best Latin cuisine!"
3113,5001,"I ended up stuck here for almost 12 hours after my flight was delayed. It would have been completely fine if the airport hotel hadn't been completely full and if every store except one convenience store and one coffee shop hadn't been closed by 10pm. At least the airport was so empty by then that I got to choose a corner to hang out in for the rest of the night and morning. The wifi was okay, too."
3114,5002,"Great airport, SUPER quick TSA esp with pre check, 2 lounges which are nice. Left hoodie at tsa check and was with security 2hours later!"
3115,5004,"Airport is abit dirty even though i was born in puerto rico and lived there for 9yrs they should clean up and renovate the airport but keep those classic u shape roof on the enterence to terminal C,B and D but must make TCA faster"
3116,5005,Nice airport with lots of amenities and places to sit. The commuter terminal needs upgrading but the rest of airport is very well kept.
3117,5007,"After the airport renovation, SJU is a very neat-looking airport. Clean bathrooms, plenty of seating around the gate area, nice shops and restaurants. It is a very functional airport for the amount of traffic it receives."
3118,5008,"San Juan Airport is pretty average American airport. Not as chaotic as its Carribean counterparts, but still not very organized. Many self-check-in kiosk were malfunctioned. Few shops. Possible to get there by public transportation, buses number 5 and 53. Taxis charging flat fee of $20."
3119,5009,Nice airport. Long security lines. But it is a great clean airport. Food accesibility and good quality. I like how the new administration work with the apearence of the facility. Looks modern.
3120,5010,"Like this airport with the teddybear. However almost ALWAYS super crowded in the transit area. But in case you are flying ex DOH, the check in and security check is fast and smooth."
3121,5011,"The best airport that i've been. So big, so amasing. The lounge of business class, it's something. 3 chef's at same time,cooking for you in the moment. All the lounge, food, rest area, shower, everithing, whith a 5 star quality. Well done Qatar."
3122,5012,"Best terminal I've experienced. Huge, beautiful, comfortable. Lots of concourse space to walk and stretch legs before and after long flights."
3123,5013,"Exiting aircraft by stairs and taking bus to terminal is very annoying. They have the money, build bigger terminal with gates"
3124,5014,"I have never been to Doha before. The airport is easy to navigate and most of the staff speak English. A custodian was cleaning the bathroom and asked where I came from. I told him I came from Boston, Massachusetts, United States. The announcements were automated and easy to understand."
3125,5015,E-X-C-E-L-L-E-N-T-!-!-! Only issue I have is the immigration stamped over some of my African stamps and didn't stamp on the page I wanted...oh well
3126,5016,"The airport had good amenities like the stores, food, lounges were all good. Also The transfer of flights was good."
3127,5017,"Very big and modern airport thats easy to navigate through, but you might get a bit lost in the duty-free section next to the bear and an unstable wifi."
3128,5018,"Amazing airport, especially for transfering passengers. A lot of choices for food and very diverse duty-free section near the bear and at the orchard."
3129,5019,"DOHA Hamada is a very modern airport with only 1 terminal that's more convenient for passengers. The facilities are easy to use and modern. The Orchard is a nice place to relax after a long flight. The only downside was the very unstable wifi. Lastly, the airport is not the best for plane spotting especially during daytime when the rotating solar panels covers up the glass. And the gate C13 is the only place you can get a good view."
3130,5020,DOH the award winning airport for 2022.. e-gate facilities is too fast and easy moving the crowd from the airport.
3131,5021,"It's all good, but the internet is a bit off lol. Are you saying Naver doesn't work? It's cut off on a random day."
3132,5022,Passports/immigration there is no specified for business class and they always send to egate first which never works have to walk the snake walk again very annoying
3133,5023,"Formerly ""best airport"" this time is overcrowded place with endless announcements as well full of loud people. If you have overnight connection you should be ready that airport hotel is fully booked, airport lounges is full, so difficult to find quiet place. To ""WiFi of 6th generation"" mostly impossible to connect, many websites isn't available, VPN is not possible turn on. Not all airport staff respect passengers privacy, some of them can speak loudly by phone when people around sleeping."
3134,5025,"The Wi-fi service is one of the worst ever experienced in an airport. After logging in it worked for about 2 minutes, extremely slow, and as I walked around in the terminal the signal was lost, and never ever could use it again."
3135,5026,Doha Airport has excellent infrastructure and accessibility for passengers. Very modern and well signposted airport. We will soon go to Tanzania for him again.
3136,5027,Modern and extremely functional airport. First-rate services and excellent customer facilities.
3137,5028,"Absolutely beautiful terminal. Modern, clean, spacious. Took a longer layover to explore the terminal."
3138,5029,"Very nice Airport overall, the online issue is the Internet connection which is highly unstable an not reliable at all as it disconnects from the devise every few seconds."
3139,5030,"Nice, helpful people, in one of the smallest international airports I have ever been in. Lot of passengers waiting in an overful lounge which was hot and sweaty, No real shops to speak of.,"
3140,5031,"This airport is not a big airport, but you can go to Paris everyday. There's not a lot of airlines, but it's enough to go on vacation."
3141,5032,"It is a good airport but with no transportation facilities to go to your home/hotel (except VERY EXPENSIVE cub). The airport has a good design that well represents the island between the sea in one side and mountains on the other. However, if your flight arrived in the same time as others coming from long destination, you will have to wait long time to get your luggage. The airport is currently in a phase of modernization and enlargement, and I think that everything will be better in few years."
3142,5034,Flight on time. Meal ok but overnight service could have been better
3143,5035,Very bad link between the airport and the main cities of the island. Lack of air con while it was extremely hot !
3144,5036,"LACK OF A LITTLE AIR CONDITIONING. WHEN YOU WAIT FOR HOURS, IT GETS HOT QUICKLY."
3145,5037,"A superb airport, quite intimate, very cool, which is perfect for protecting yourself from the tropical sun of Reunion. On one side, the slopes and the sea. On the other, the car park and the mountain, including a magnificent view of the Piton des Neiges... ++++"
3146,5038,If your English this airport can be a bit on the hard side to use as all announcements are in Romanian or Italian
3147,5039,"Since 2020 the airport is completely new and bigger (terminal, parking, runway and all systems), and it is a big change from the airport as we all knew from previous years."
3148,5042,"Airport dedicated to low-cost flights, so don't expect to much. I say it's an average airport, and don't forget, it's a military base too, and the facilities are not as high as some people will expect."
3149,5048,Small and crowded. Only low cost air companies here or for private jets. Recommend Otopeni Airport.
3150,5051,"As always the bathrooms were stinky and I personally think that this shouldn't be a turist's first welcome into this beautiful and diverse country. Otherwise, baggage claim went quite well!"
3151,5054,Nothing to write home about. Nice cafe before security but the wifi would not work on my laptop anywhere in this airport!
3152,5056,"Security check is a ""do it yourself"", better to take the bus not to miss the train as the schedule is sometimes hard to find, otherwise it is a good airport but feeling old."
3153,5057,"I used Bolt to get from hotel to airport and they came within minutes unlike other who said 45 minutes, cheaper as well."
3154,5060,"Very crowded, long queues, rude staff and the bathrooms weren't clean. If you have to drop off a baggage, good luck for it to arrive at your destination as intact as it was! Definetly you need to arrive 3 hours before your flight during peak hours."
3155,5062,"Cluj Airport may be crowded at some hours (a terminal extension is in progress and should be ready at the beginning of 2024), but it has the advantage of having a fast check-in/security check process and less walking to make as it is pretty small. There are not many stores/food places at this moment, but after the extension is ready it should have quite a few. Parking options improved a lot lately and the price is ok. It is connected easily to the city with public transport (Airport Express every 30 mins in the terminal or the line 5 in front of the airport). You can pass through security with liquids as they have advanced scanning equipment. The main issue is the lounge which is way too small at certain hours (until the new one will be ready)."
3156,5063,"Nice small airport close to the city center fast check-in and security. Liquids of any size can be brought through security, modern equipment. Not many shops or cafes there."
3157,5065,The airport is very well connected to the city and is easy to reach. The security check was quick and the staff very friendly. The boarding gate area is very tight and congested and there aren't many dining options. I didn't notice any open wifi network in the airport.
3158,5066,"I travelled with a baby pram and it arrived upside down, with all the accesories layd on the baggage belt. Dirty and unusable till washed thoroughly."
3159,5067,"Sometimes very crowded and extension didn't do much to help. If there are 2-3 departures at the same time , god bless.. the airport is dead , parking lot is a mess. Facilities pretty much lack , chairs in the waiting hall are very uncomfortable , there is no wifi so to speak of , there is no place to eat something consistent..it really feels like a national airport rather than an international one."
3160,5068,"It was a nice and small airport , the baggages arrived in 5 minutes , the place for spotting was nice . I reccomend this airport for spotting"
3161,5069,I arrived at the airport on time... after a coffee in Gentleman's with Mircea Mocean... but the plane was delayed... for about an hour and a half... :(
3162,5070,The airport was really small and old but as I already said I don't care about how luxury it is as long as I can get cheap flight tickets.The airport was good enough to help us through the check in and to offer us a good flight.
3163,5073,"The airport is really small, so it is good for checking-in, claiming baggage, and passing controls. Bus line 9 and Bacriz line 9 are very convenient, but if you arrive at night you can only take a taxi, trying to negociate a good price or making sure he turns the taxi meter on. Wifi is good but sometimes it is not working due to crowding. There is a duty-free shop and two places to eat, but no VIP lounge."
3164,5074,This airport even has an aquarium
3165,5076,"Everything went by very quickly, very minimal wait times. I got into my taxi very quick after landing."
3166,5077,"During the cold season, on too many occasions flights get cancelled or diverted because of fog or poor visibility. It happens so often, I'd make it a priority investing in better guiding systems. Airport ground handlers (Menzies in this case) have no regard to luggage, dropping them frequently on the ground from the plane or belts. No consideration of priority labels either during delivery."
3167,5078,"A nice little provincial airport, that doesn't offer much, but not much is needed. Terminal 2 is little more than a glorified shack you need to pass through, but it gets the job done. The newly-opened Terminal 3 is more spacious and more modern, but still pretty basic, which is understandable considering Iasi is a city of 300 thousand. Terminal 2 can get crowded even when loading a single 737, but it's not unbearable, especially with T3 helping out with the load of the growing number of passengers. Might sound strange to have 3 terminals for one small airport, but keep in mind none of them is much bigger than your average supermarket. And with the constantly increasing number of passengers and flights, it looks like there will be need for a Terminal 4 soon enough. :)"
3168,5080,"The facilities on arrival are absolutely basic, with one small arrivals area, an even smaller lugage belt around which all passengers fight to ge tot their luggage first, and toilets. The luggage itself is delivered extremely slowly (more than 30 minutes wait), even when only single medium-sized airplane is handled (~120 passengers). Passengers are not allowed to take photographs inside the terminal and are immediately told off by security if seen attempting to do so."
3169,5081,"Very smooth checkin, security check and passport control, friendly personel. Improvement works are currently under way, probably the International Terminal will be upgraded as well. Only waiting area I know, with a terrace!"
3170,5082,"Very nice new runway. Immigration was fast, luggage delivery slightly slow (20+ minutes, considering it was only one B733 that arrived). Very hot and stuffy inside, a bit of a/c would have been amazing on a hot and humid day. Unfortunately, no photography is allowed and they are very strict about it (almost hunting you down). Public transport (bus line 50) now available from the airport too."
3171,5083,"The airport is improving right now. New runway and there's going to be a brand new transport line by bus direct from the city. So..a big like for now, Iasi!"
3172,5084,"Pleasantly surprised to find a very good free WiFi available. The new runway is under construction, which is definitely a good sign. Sadly, the old terminal (now T1) is still being used for international flights, and gets very cramped with 100+ pax."
3173,5086,"Airport continues to grow,hope in the future will be more international flights available from this airport,"
3174,5087,It could be even bigger...
3175,5088,"Fast check in, fast security check, quick arrival at the airport. The terminal for internal departures could use at least a vending machine for some snacks, refreshments and coffee."
3176,5089,"Very easy to reach, easy parking. They did not allow us to check in our hand luggage (should be allowed as per Wizz policy), they take them only at the aircraft, which was a bit of a problem for us. Water extremely overpriced, tap water is labelled as not fit for drinking."
3177,5090,Nice airport for a medium-sized city. Public transport can be found at the exit of airport but you can take a cab. A taxi trip from airport to city center costs 4 Euros.
3178,5091,"It's an OK airport for coming and leaving, I mean, don't expect it to be like Frankfurt. If you come without expectations you are not going to be disappointed. Although there is a lach of destinations in my opinion it's good for just visiting a beautiful city. I would recommend going to Sibiu."
3179,5092,Very small but convenient airport. Lack of public transport is a big disadvantage.
3180,5094,back to Targu mures.... on the way I was honored by a very nice Romanian.... with chips and a can of beer. then my mother and Dan Hila came after me... and I drove all the way home:) .. it was nice....
3181,5099,"Tiny airport where you have to walk between airplane and terminal. It seems to be well organized. Food options are limited, but the WiFi is good. Getting to the airport is only possible by car/taxi."
3182,5100,"Getting to the airport is via Bus which have an unpleasant timetable or by taxi. Arogant security staff every time I hae been there. Check In is fast, Wifi is not working. Overall is an small good airport"
3183,5101,The domestic departure terminal is quite small. but you have a self-service shop for food and drinks. I appriciate the terrace with view on the apron.
3184,5103,"Nice regional airport with very basic facilities, you can even walk to the plane. Be aware of queues at security, might take even longer that at large airports when nultiple planes depart close to each other in time."
3185,5104,"Good wifi and low prices for food services. Besides that, it is a very small airport and the transit is problematic: you need to get out of the security zone and then check-in again."
3186,5106,"Small airport is busy now Ryanair also flies from Timisoara Passport control will be fast you're quickly out of the airport. The airport is fine however improvements are needed when it comes to cleanliness (floor corners in the waiting area were dirty, smelly toilets etc) and detail maintenance. Information desk attendant was unaware of bus to city schedule and although nice kinda unhelpful..she obviously needs to learn more about her job and the area."

3189,5111,"Nice airport. Better than many Russian small ports. But the post-security area is small and boring. Don't rush to board, security is quite quick, you can check in 40 minutes before departure"
3190,5113,Poorly equiped airport. The only way to get here from the city is by taxi. During high season the price is really high. Baggage claim is located outdoors. It's really harmful to wait for the luggage in summer time under the direct sunlight and without any AC.
3191,5115,"Review for the domestic terminal - the ""international"" terminal seems to be a very rudimentary structure, haven't tried that. The domestic terminal is also quite a basic facility, but reasonable given the traffic volumes - ie., nice little regional airport. Getting to the airport is by bus or taxi - neither of them too comfortable (bus intervals are somewhat unpredictable, they say 20-40 mins), but at least cheap. Parking facilities are scarce and in a bad shape, but I guess foreign travelers won't need to deal with that. Check-in & security fine, no queue at least. Terminal facilities are very minimalist, though cafes are OK. The Aeroflot business lounge sells souvenirs incl. mammoth and walrus bone artifacts - otherwise not too remarkable as a business lounge. Overall - fine as a remote regional airport, but that's it."
3192,5116,"Not quite big regional airport which now is under reconstruction. It has two terminals which will be connected in one big building by 2017. The first airport in the North West of Russia except Saint Petersburg which has direct passes to aircrafts by boarding bridges. Airport has domestic terminal and old awfull international terminal which serves charter airlines to Turkey, Egypt, Cyprus etc. International terminal is from Soviet Era and has narrow hallways and stairways. When more than 200 passengers go to customs security control simultaneously there is a hell happens. Domestic terminal is much better. It has cafes and small stores. Baggage claim is in the domestic terminal and some times takes a long time to get your luggage especially when several aircrafts arrive at the same time. The rate of this airport is average."
3193,5117,"Domestic terminal review! Home of Nordavia. It is a small airport, quite far from Arkhangelsk centre. However, there is a regular bus service (bus #12) going from the city to the airport, and back. Domestic terminal is under construction. Fence outside allows you going quite close to some plane stops for spotting. Low prices of food/drinks. Mailbox, but no airport post office. A few shops, including cafe in clean area. A tiny airport to be suddenly crowded with many passengers. Clean area is on the second floor, with free magazines, charging points, many chairs. Boarding both with the bridge and airport buses."
3194,5120,"A small airport, mostly always crowded. I use it as a start point to then fly to bigger airports. Due to the small size, it isn't the most modern, but isn't overly old. Check in is fast, security is decently fast due to being not very new/modern. Has a luggage wrapping station in the main area. Lounge is simple area with a lot of chairs. Food and drinks aren't very expensive."
3195,5122,"(Review just for arrivals building) Nice little regional airport with a handful of flights a day (most - 4 - of them to/from Moscow), very basic facilities, but acceptable condition. Brings back the golden age of air travel that passengers walk to and from the plane. Don't expect too mich of catering/shops, maybe a coffee is all you can grab. The departure building looks nice & new though, should be decent inside. Nice to see airports like this after all the big ones."
3196,5123,"A good small airport! For a city like Barnaul it’s quite enough. There aren’t many people, everything is fast everywhere, there are cafes, everything is very cozy, and it’s a walk to the plane :)"
3197,5126,Nice new airport for me.Old building was nightmare. Happy for all new in Belgorod. I hope someday there will be a spotting session.
3198,5127,"The airport is new. Everything is clean and neat inside, the staff is friendly and will always help you with choosing a flight. Convenient waiting room for both domestic and international flights. Although the city itself is not very big, the airport for it is built at the highest level."
3199,5128,"I am amazed, and pleasantly amazed. The airport is beautiful, very cozy and neat. Special thanks to the staff, very polite and friendly. I used Wi-fi, read the press and, of course, bought several souvenirs."
3200,5129,"For the first time in Belgorod. I couldn’t even think that there could be such a wonderful airport in this town. I fly a lot, and I can confidently say that there is something unique about it. Very clean. Friendly and helpful staff. I really liked the souvenir shop."
3201,5130,"Belgorod Airport is an excellent airport. Appearance, service - everything is at the highest level. Great coffee in the cafe. Fast check-in, convenient waiting room. A variety of magazines on the free press desks provide something to keep yourself occupied while waiting for your flight."
3202,5131,"It was my first time in Belgorod. And the airport turned out to be a huge attraction of this city. The airport was impressive. The staff was very friendly and answered all my questions. Check-in was very quick. I was able to use many services, which made me very happy. Success and prosperity to Belgorod airport."
3203,5132,"Everything was perfect. Airport is nice and comfortable, service is superb. The placement area is very convenient, it's inside the city, everything is close. All sectors and WC are clean. The security guys in entrance are polite and friendly, passenger service is highly qualified."
3204,5133,"Good airport for Belgorod. Easy to reach, everything was fast, stuff was pleasant, got a free meal while waiting the plane. It could be better to extend the geography of regular flights from there. Good experience in other words."
3205,5134,"Great airport! Beautiful both outside and inside. The staff's work is excellent. Everyone is friendly, friendly, and always ready to help."
3206,5139,"The international terminal of Ignatyevo Airport (Blagoveshchensk) is simply a real hell. The room is terribly small, there is no ventilation, the toilet is just a nightmare. Upon registration, they said that it would be possible to go online, but they tried all night and nothing worked."
3207,5140,"I was about 9 times on the airport. I found the toilets dirty. Staff more friendly to foreigners as to locals. I find it strange that Russian clients are treated in old Soviet style, not friendly. Baggage claim very good and controlled."
3208,5144,"The renovation of the airport has radically improved its level. It has been transformed from a decaying, gray airport into a colorful, historic work of art. There are thematic zones in which nuclear energy is explained in a clear and accessible way."
3209,5147,Operator:USCC-NOVAPORT Chek-In-Desk:2-4 RWY:27 Gate:2 (Bus) Handling: Balandino Apt Handling
3210,5148,"We always fly through our airport. I am glad that our airport is developing quickly. The flight program is expanding. Previously, you had to fly from neighboring Yekaterinburg, but now you can fly directly, for example, to the Czech Republic or Vietnam. The terminals are constantly being reconstructed, facades are being updated, new luggage belts are being added. Special seats have been installed in the internal waiting room, equipped with sockets for charging electronics. Throughout the airport Wi-Fi was provided, and it was very good."
3211,5149,Good airport.
3212,5150,"We managed to collect queues at all stages - at the entrance to the terminal, to the security check area. At the boarding house, they forgot the passengers"
3213,5151,"Among all passengers we left the airport in a small side gate and directed to the baggage claim area, and I simply head back to the terminal re-check in for the flight back to Moscow."
3214,5152,So low rate due to Chita-Kadala had one of the most old terminal among the USSR airport at that time. It's still being used until early 90th of 20 century minimum.
3215,5153,"When I arrived airport, CA staff come to ask my name... then help me to carried my luggage......Check-in...Security check...Boarding gate(= Lounge) are not the same floor...so funny..."
3216,5154,"First Macau people go there(maybe included Hong Kong), The Immigration check my passport over 20mins......I know this is a special place... You can see many old type aircraft when landing"
3217,5158,Disgusting entry control system with minimal separation of passenger flow. Fragile luggage is sent along with other items. The waiting room is always crowded with not enough seats.
3218,5159,The best point is that it's easy to get to the airport from the city. You just hop on a bus and in 15 minutes you are there.
3219,5160,"The good point about this airport is that there are a lot of buses that can take you from there to the city center. However, it's completely impossible how to use them if you are new to the city."
3220,5161,"Even though it's an old airport but renovated. Plenty of coffee shops where you can have a fast snack of cup of coffeee for the reasonable price. A great amout of souvenir and handcraft shops . Due to the fact that airport located in the city, it's pretty cheap to get here by taxi."
3221,5162,"One of the strangest business halls! They issue a card for 350 rubles. At the same time, coffee costs 200, ice cream 250-350, water 80. Beer 450 and for cash"
3222,5164,First flight to Izhevsk airport. For me this is a very significant moment because... the airport opened to other airlines and free competition.
3223,5165,"Very small airport, inconvenient arrival hall. The departure area was spacious"
3224,5166,It feels like you’re in the Soviet era: no Wi-Fi; You can't take pictures. I'm a bit stressed out about public transport - it's better to immediately rely on a taxi (and it's better to call Yandex.Taxi - taxi drivers at the airport charge twice as much). The rest is clean and tidy.
3225,5168,"Small domestic airport. There are not so bad cafe, free wi-fi. good toilet, good road to the airport and parking (esp. for Russia). If anyone of your friend here can't pick up u, u can write me here, it will be free. By the way there is a bus stop which working from 5-10AM to 10-10PM it is not so much exp. Get rest."
3226,5170,Getting to the airport is a bit difficult. Buses run rarely and do not fit into the schedule.
3227,5171,"The Priority Pass lounge for domestic flights is very small, anti-virus measures are not observed, and there is no choice of food and drinks at all."
3228,5172,"Good airport with good services. One disappointing thing is too much people near baggage claim, too close place)"
3229,5173,"It's a really new terminal, no crowds. Fast service, no delays with security control. Boarding is fast too, but teletraps are not always used - sometimes you have to use the bus on the air field. Gates, as a rule, are not changed. All according to the schedule. Several cafes and shops.There are ATMs, vending machines and coffee machines."
3230,5174,"New big terminal, fast service, good personal. Boarding in 5 minutes, chec-in - 10 minutes. All is exellent. Food and retail sevices very good."
3231,5175,"The airport is pleasant and easy to get but there is lack of facilities inside. Only one vending machine to buy water and it was extremely overpriced. Confusing signs that tell you the restrooms are in the hall that is behind a blind glass wall. However, it's clean and spacy."
3232,5176,The airport is under reconstruction and every time getting better and better!As for now they built a new departure zone and the place for reclaiming baggage.
3233,5177,"The airport is small, and even I would say small. But everything is compact and fast. We walked from the plane to the entrance to the terminal building. All 50-60 meters."
3234,5178,"If you travel with a company, its better to take a taxi (approx 500rub on august 2015) - a little bit more expensive than local bus (70rub per person), but far more comfortable and faster, and takes you to place you want in some 30 minutes. Maps and sity guides are at the book store. A very cheap cafe is at the second floor. Wifi is free and fast."
3235,5179,"Khrabrovo airport is under reconstruction now. It well connected to the highway, and can be reached by bus or by taxi from Kaliningrad in a few minutes. Departures and arrivals of domestic and international flights are in one building. Quite good Duty free shops and free Wi-Fi zone in international area. All the staff very friendly. Baggage claim usually quick: approx. 15 min."

3237,5182,Excellent airport with essential shops. As well as increased control and quick registration.
3238,5183,"You can get to the airport for just 46 rubles by train. The terminal is quite new, not very big, but there is enough space. But there was no place for a normal business lounge; they allocated a small nook, even before going through security. The food there is poor, but at least there is unlimited beer. There are few shops, there were inexpensive eateries, but at the time of writing this review (November 2021) they were closed for reconstruction, and it is unknown whether they will open again. After passing control, be prepared for the fact that the meal will be quite expensive."
3239,5184,"Nice modern terminal. Not too much passengers. Fast and chip suburb train from city center to the terminal (30 minutes, $0.5). Everything's good"
3240,5185,"The airport itself is alright but getting to and especially from can be frustrating. Airport train has only 5 rides per day, bus to/from Park Pobedy metro is simply hideous, and getting taxi from the airport can be frustrating."
3241,5186,"The business lounge is located before check-in, although the airport website and the PriorityPass website say that it is after. There is no toilet in the hall itself; you have to go outside to wash your hands. The choice of dishes is poor, and there is nothing stronger than beer for alcohol."
3242,5187,"There is a new excellent terminal in Kazan. There is a train from the city. Comfortable, new, beautiful. There is a huge parking lot"
3243,5188,While security checking I was unhappily surprised when a security officer refused a security check to a young couple because they had boarding passes printed after online check-in. They had to go to check-in counter:(
3244,5189,It's not correct when wi-fi can be use only Russian or people with Russian mobile phone. It's an international and national airport !!!!!
3245,5190,"Nice, small, comfortable airport. After the construction of the new terminal A, the airport has become much better, jetways have appeared, sockets have appeared, new equipment, understanding Aviation security staff will always help!"
3246,5191,For 2 kg they forced me to overpay. We spent half an hour looking for the price per kg. No composure..
3247,5192,"Small friendly regional airport. Baggage reclaim was an experience, especially when luggage is delayed in Moscow for 24 hours."
3248,5193,"Such a stinky airport, to be honest"
3249,5194,"The most beautiful and comfortable in the Far East! Spacious, comfortable, it has everything you need!"
3250,5195,New terminal. Everything is beautiful and comfortable. Lots of elevators and escalators. Very bright and spacious.
3251,5201,"I haven’t been to the airport for several years, so what immediately caught my eye was that the common baggage belt is still not connected by an additional moving belt, which usually should come from the check-in counters. The “bull” standing next to the racks carries luggage in his arms from the racks to the common belt. It looks at least funny, but in fact it is very backward. I am glad that the insanity requirement of the mandatory presence of an airport bus, which must transport passengers to the plane (or back to the terminal building), has not yet been introduced. Now passengers independently cover the distance from the plane to the building (or back) in one minute, without the need to stupidly waste time waiting for the bus to fill with people and set off, skirting the entire intra-airport area. Unfortunately, such stupidity was introduced at the Naryan-Mar airport - it is also a small airport, and buses like this really waste passengers’ time. Otherwise, everything is stable: a small, cozy airport with everything you need for a comfortable wait for the plane. True, the boiler with free drinking water has not yet been returned (to the delight of the cafeterias there and to the sadness of the passengers)."
3252,5202,"Small quiet regional airport. There is some strange cafe, a “Chocolate Girl” stand, a couple of souvenir shops and a pharmacy. And it’s important - there are racks for charging gadgets!"
3253,5203,50 meters by bus from the ramp to the airport terminal is funny. They could have stopped stuffing everything into the shabby LiAZ and let it walk around in peace.
3254,5204,"A typical regional airport with low passenger traffic. The hall is freshly and well renovated, everything is quite neat. But there was nowhere to eat at all, only vending machines with drinks, and the only working shops were a souvenir shop."
3255,5205,"Pobedilovo is changing! It's nice to see significant improvements at the airport: now there is a departures/arrivals board in Russian and English, and a modern check-in counter with electronic correct scales, and shops with souvenirs, and high-quality security checks, and even a large waiting room with TVs and free water !! (which (water in the sense) I couldn’t find even in Sheremetyevo). In general, modest, compact and convenient!"
3256,5208,Airport Kostroma/Sokerkino is very little but quite comfortable. It's very easy to get there by city bus for only 20 min from town centre.
3257,5209,"Wonderful province airport. Good staff. Base port for Kostroma-avia airlines. Airport placed in 350 km. from Moscow (DME, SVO, VKO). Kostroma-avia getting flights to St. Petersburg, Ekaterinburg, Kazan, Simferopol, Anapa and Voronezh(only in summer). Basic company's aircraft is Antonov AN-124 and AN-124-100."
3258,5210,"Really nice small 1-floor airport! Helpful staff. No wi-fi, but free water and coffee."
3259,5211,Pretty small and just pretty airoport with free coffee and candies! There's airline «Kostroma Air» base.
3260,5212,Airport very small . It’s cool if you come to Krasnodar every be fast. But if you departing from you really need priority pass. Seriously
3261,5213,"Constant and endless queues at the airport. Registration began at 6:25 p.m., and staff arrived at 6:32 p.m. The queue at passport control, the queue at the security service. An incredible number of people in the waiting room. Before the flight, people sat on the floor and stood in the aisles. If the airport is able to accommodate so many flights, then why not make the pre-flight lounge larger? The airport has only 2 advantages: a smoking booth and WiFi. Although WiFi is now available almost everywhere, including the metro. And you cannot visit the smoking booth after you have gone through passport control and security."
3262,5214,"A small regional airport, there are many flights in the morning, but not enough space."
3263,5215,"reconstruction was carried out, the airport building became much more pleasant and spacious. All that remains is for the registration agents to be taught to be polite."
3264,5216,Both domestic and international terminals are reconstructed now (September 2014). The temporary runway is also finished. For the moment Krasnodar aiport is much more attractive compared to it's state just a few months ago.
3265,5220,Good but quite small
3266,5221,Airfield is under construction. Airport is small but very nice.
3267,5222,The new terminal is beautiful and very convenient. The only drawback is that the terminal is located far from the city.
3268,5223,"Airport is located so far from the city. There is only one point in city where you can take bus to airport. It is a bus station. There are two old small terminals in the airport. Bus they build a new terminal, what going to be opened in December 2017."
3269,5224,"The airport is really far away from the city. If you speak Russian though, it's easy to understand how to get a public bus. However, if you don't... well, it's not your lucky day then."
3270,5227,"Airport need to be renovated, in 3 years officials promise to do it, hope so. Usually overcrouded in morning rush hours, when lot of flights come from and depature to Moscow, try not to take luggage with you. Small rage of routes where you can travel from it. My mark 3- up to 5 band scores."
3271,5231,"We hope that in the future the airport will operate flights to other cities in Russia, and possibly even to other countries! Very friendly airport staff! Thank you!"
3272,5232,"There are flight delays at this airport and it is not very convenient. It's a pity that there are few flights, only one. Let's hope that everything will be fine."
3273,5237,"How many years have passed, and taxi drivers continue to molest arriving passengers, imposing their services. Otherwise, everything went well."
3274,5238,"There are huge queues at the entrance and for inspection, you have to wait more than 10 minutes every time. This is due to the fact that only 2 frames work, there are 2 people on each frame, so the luggage scanner tape constantly stops. In short, the airport is not even trying to cope with the increased passenger traffic at times. Almost all flights for some reason wait a long time for permission to start the engines, although the apron is free, so many flights are delayed for more than 15-20 minutes just standing idle on the apron."
3275,5240,"Food and drinks are more expensive than at Moscow airports. There is almost nowhere to wait until the inspection, as a good waiting room on the second floor was moved to a sterile area"
3276,5241,"This time the airport was pleased - the luggage was given out immediately upon arrival at the terminal. However, I had to go for the luggage myself - the conveyor was turned off. And another nuisance is still present at the airport - taxi drivers imposing their services at the exit of the arrival terminal. They literally pester passengers."
3277,5242,There are still too many taxi drivers right in the airport terminal who are pestering passengers who already have a car. And still all the procedures are very long. It begins to seem to me that this is a mandatory quality of Mineralnye Vody airport...
3278,5243,There are no announcements that boarding has begun. There is only that it is completed :)
3279,5246,"In the business lounge, instead of a buffet, there is a beach ration, coffee, beer, etc. - for a fee. The TV was not turned on, but the German language could be heard from it"
3280,5249,"Everything went quickly, without unnecessary questions. The only drawback is that there are very few toilets in the arrival area and it is very far to go from the plane to them."
3281,5250,"One of the Big Three in Moscow. And the worst of all. Immigration (this time?) incredibly long-winded and fussy; Either I was extra unlucky (the counters on the left and right were 3x faster) or the immigration officer was on Italian strike... But at least I got through without any problems. And on the way back, we saw a cockroach at an abandoned coffee stand..."
3282,5251,"Convenient location. Very cozy and comfortable. Ample space to wait for departure and rest. Lots of cafes, coffee shops, restaurants, and, of course, fast food."
3283,5253,"It is better to bypass the Priority Pass hall by the side. A small shed is packed with passengers with children, and at the entrance they don't even try to convince you about the overcrowding of the hall and the lack of seats. But the money and the number of visits are written off without delay."
3284,5255,I like it better when they check the luggage number to avoid mistakes.
3285,5257,Good airport Small. Much better than Zhukovsky
3286,5259,My favorite airport. I used business lounge there and I liked it. I always use it when I fly from Sheremetyevo.
3287,5261,Sheremetyevo is my favourite airport. It is always good for passengers. There are a lot of restaurants inside.
3288,5262,Sheremetyevo was always the best airport for me. This time it was as good as always. The staff are kind. It has a big choice of the cafes and restaurants where you can sit and eat.
3289,5265,"Luggage was handed out slowly. Even at night, there are good fast food cafes, such as KFC and McDonald's, where prices are reasonable."
3290,5266,"Putting strong 4! I got from Duty Free to Gate in less than 5 minutes. Otherwise, there's a lack of shops."
3291,5267,"A very nice airport with a lot of shops, lounges and stuff. Has 5 terminals and 1 terminal for business aviation. A nice, lovely airport, what to say more?"
3292,5268,There are drinking fountains everywhere (departure and arrival) in Terminal B.
3293,5269,"For me, this is the best airport in Moscow, period. It's pretty easy to reach now, and when the metro runs directly to the terminal in a few years, it'll be perfect."
3294,5270,"For some reason, at the exit there was a huge line at customs, almost everyone was checked. There was pure chaos in the passenger boarding area in the parking lot; people were loading in the second and third rows."
3295,5271,"Minuses: -Dirty toilets -The hand dryer did not work Pluses: +Location and configuration +Fast control +The boarding hall is huge, there is a lot of seating, a gorgeous panoramic view of the airfield."
3296,5274,????? ??????? ??? ???? ?????????? ????. ??????? ???????? ? ??????????.
3297,5275,My favorite Moscow airport. Very beautiful and accessible.
3298,5276,Very smooth experience. Lots of good facilities including playgrounds for kids. Didn't go to a lounge. Duty Free almost directly in front of International Security. Didn't go to Domestic Departures. Boarding took a long time as we used a bus and stairs.
3299,5277,Very smooth experience. Lots of good facilities including playgrounds for kids. Didn't go to a lounge and didn't use the baggage claim. Duty Free next to International Security. Didn't go to domestic departures. Boarding took a long time as we used a bus and stairs.
3300,5279,"This is a good airport for those people who are hurrying and being late for their flight, because there are no queues on security check and sometimes on check-in"
3301,5280,ZHUKOVSKY(ZIA-UUBW) Check-In-Desk:02 Ground.Handl:ZIA.Apt.Serv Catering:- Gate:7 RWY:12 Departure:23:25 Gate.Pushback:00:00 Take-Off:00:02 RWY.Time:02min
3302,5283,"Not big airport but quite comfortable. There is a problem with transport - buses go rarely, so only taxy is a reliable transport."
3303,5284,"This was the first 973 flight to land at this airport, and the second flight total. The airport was still brand new and many services didn't work yet. I had found a taxi company with fixed prices for ZIA-Moscow, but they made me wait only to let me know no cars were available. I got a local taxi for an okay'ish price. As for the airport, it was cute to see the signs for transfer and passport control since there were none."
3304,5287,"An ordinary airport in Siberia, nothing special, the workers are good, they do their job. Reconstruction is starting at the airport, we'll see what happens."
3305,5288,Not a very convenient airport for international flights! Small waiting area for boarding.
3306,5289,"Quite an ordinary, cozy airport for a city with a population of up to 300 thousand inhabitants. Excellent unbroken runway. There are many additional flights during the summer season, so there are no problems going on vacation. There are many flights to Moscow. Nice airport."
3307,5290,"Decent airport, convenient to get from the city (20-25 minutes) by regular bus. A beautiful alley with models of airplanes and helicopters. Terminal 2 is practically not used. One of the inconveniences is the exit from the baggage claim, where there is a constant crush. I would like to see more flights from Nizhnevartovsk to all directions. P.S. I would like the airport management to agree on POBEDA airline flights so that you can visit your favorite city much more often."
3308,5291,"Regular airport)))) There is a place to eat, from the airport it’s a 5-minute walk to the hotel. There are no problems with taxis. Quite cozy. No complaints. There were no problems. Has two terminals. There is a bus stop nearby. ........................................................ ........................................................ ..........................."
3309,5292,"It is mainly an oil production region, not gas. The airport has two terminals, domestic and international. The facilities are ok, quite a few ATM machines, a cafeteria, and a couple kiosks, spacious upper floor. No food/beweriges in holding room."
3310,5293,"Brand new fantastic airport building just opened this year. Modern design, comfortable inside, all facilities, business lounge - high class. Strong impression."
3311,5294,"Very helpful stuff. Good cafe. Small and convinience airport. Very quick check-in and security control. Small, very convenient airport, with good polite staff. A new large terminal is being built"
3312,5295,"Good airport. Free autoparking is not near for building of airport. I think, you can reach it for 15 minutes, walking along allee. Now is building new terminal. It will be larger than old airport & it will has new technical equipment."
3313,5296,"Beatiful city with lot of tourists attractions, Kremlin, Chkalov stairs and Bolshaya Pokrovskaya str. Nice view from top of hills. Old buildings with interesting architecture. The airport is quite old and has only two floors, there is quite small place even for pax of 2-3 simulatneous flights."
3314,5297,The airport management has done everything possible to ensure the comfort of passengers in the existing terminal. We are waiting for the new terminal!!!
3315,5298,old airport
3316,5306,"There weren't any big queues, s7 loungy is very comfortable with beautiful interiors. Everythinng was excellent"
3317,5307,"The new terminal has significantly improved the level of comfort when flying from Novosibirsk, but the toilet in the departure area looks as if it is already 20 years old and is cleaned once a day, and there are still a lot of bulls and the smell of smoking, is there no smoking room in Tolmachevo?"
3318,5308,"The new terminal is spacious, modern, clean, beautiful. There were queues for registration only at Aeroflot, at the inspection without queues at all, everything was fast and without unnecessary questions. In the waiting room, if you go a little further, you can sit in silence at exit 4, with a beautiful view of the airfield."
3319,5309,"The airport is improving - baggage collection has become more convenient. In particular, the tape is no longer stopped after putting all the luggage on it. Boarding a taxi is difficult, not only because of the frosts, but also because the airport has forced the entire front row with its own taxi cars. As a result, instead of a comfortable landing, all passengers with suitcases and bags are forced to squeeze between cars."
3320,5310,"There were no long queues, all the procedures were carried out quickly. They didn't find fault with the inspection, for which I thank you. We would rather finish the construction, otherwise it is inconvenient to enter with luggage without a cart on the street. P. S. Food and drinks at the airport are still very expensive..."
3321,5311,"Due to the reconstruction, it takes a long time to walk through a narrow passage to enter the airport building. There were only 2 check-in counters, but there was no queue. But there was a queue for inspection. They also delayed boarding the plane for 15 minutes."
3322,5312,"This time there were no queues anywhere. Absolutely. Therefore, I was late, I managed to catch my flight. Great ????"
3323,5313,"The airport is under reconstruction, so I won't be too critical. We waited for luggage for a long time, the conveyor belt was constantly stopped. I actually had to walk across the hall to get my suitcase just because the tape was stopped."
3324,5314,"Checking in is carried out on two tables, which creates long queues. Also, the check-in staff calmly let hand luggage violating the norm into the cabin of the aircraft..."
3325,5315,"My estimates relate only to August 2021, when the airport is undergoing a full-scale renovation and construction of a new terminal. When disembarking, the flow of arriving passengers mixes with the flow of departing passengers (in the clean zone 0_0), a large crowd is created. Sanitary measures, accordingly, cannot be observed. Also, due to the construction, the only exit from both terminals remained - through the international sector. There are also too many people in the baggage claim area. I think all these main problems will be solved after the construction is completed."
3326,5318,"The departure terminal is great, but the international arrival is not that good and they are usually breaking the baggage."
3327,5319,"in the business lounge with priority pass. On June 28, the kitchen was not yet open. They only gave me some water. the toilet is clean."
3328,5320,"The airport is small. The ones that annoy you the most are the women in the arrivals area; until they check the tag on your luggage, these bastards will stand as an asterisk in the door and won’t let you in without paperwork. Another sign of stupidity is the siren, which flashes and emits a heart-rending scream when the baggage belt starts moving. In all civilized cities they announce the start of baggage collection. Improve this huge minus and you will have a very good aeroport."
3329,5322,"Renovated old airport built in 1970. Renovation nevertheless not hide old fashion structure of the airport itself and allow only limited facilities and services to exist. it is not bad airport at all, but don't expect anything more then just flight and boarding."
3330,5323,"Omsk - is my hometown. Nevertheless i want write a critical remark regaring airport. First of all, it is Wi-Fi connection. It's terrible. Access in free internet i can get only through authorization in social networks (VK, OK, Facebook and etc). But i haven't account in social networks!!! It's very bad that internet provider (Omskie Cabelnye Seti) made authorization by this way. Need to change it because it is normal for good airport if each passenger have a free internet access for some minutes (half hour or more). Please pay attention to this."
3331,5324,"The snowy Moscow flights arriving en masse, coupled with the massive return of Moscow Omsk residents to work, formed solid clusters at all checkpoints of the Central Airport, workers, to whose credit, promptly, where it depended on them, “sorted out” clients. Well done! Thank you!"
3332,5325,"The biggest problem is very slow passport and custiom controlls, espesially at night. Also, there is very old and dirty baggage claim in International Terminal. Despite these things, Omsk airport is cosy, comfortable. It has free wi-fi."
3333,5328,"The airport is small, trade is well developed, but for baggage claim and customs 3 stars. It takes a long time to service luggage because there are few staff. And their salary is not large."
3334,5329,"luggage is issued not on a belt, but already laid out in a special room"
3335,5330,"If possible, use the services of the business lounge (2000 rubles/person). If possible, use business lounge (2,000 RUR/person)."
3336,5331,The smoking room in front of the toilet is annoying.
3337,5335,"The new terminal is very comfortable. Sadly, the jetbridges are not working yet due to apron reconstruction. Waiting for your flight isn't boring, there are a lot of shops and two cafeterias in the domestic flights zone. Overall, this terminal is much better than the old one."
3338,5336,"The airport is of course so-so, but if they start building a “new” large Savino, I would like it to be as convenient, comfortable and beautiful as possible. Thanks for understanding!"
3339,5342,I was born in Kamchatka & love it very much that is why I can't be objective)). But Kamchatka is absolutely majestic!
3340,5347,"Beautiful and convenient airport. All intuitive. When departing a lot of places for comfortable waiting for the flight. Plenty of seating, including comfortable sofas. Cafes, interactive entertainment, great view of the apron and the runway from the third floor. On arriving without luggage, the journey from the plane to the exit from the airport takes a few minutes. WiFi works, fast mobile 4G."
3341,5348,A bit far compared to the old airport. But now there is a big beautiful terminal.
3342,5349,"Fantastic new regional airport with all necessary equipment, facilities and comfort things, security. Respect! One minus - quite far away from the city itself"
3343,5350,"It’s a pretty good airport, although it’s not easy to get there, you either have to wait for a bus that comes every time, or take a taxi or minibus"
3344,5351,"Getting to the airport is very difficult: a taxi costs the same as in Moscow airports, a minibus - once an hour or less, an Aeroexpress - never got there at all (2 times a day, it seems)"
3345,5352,"Limited options how to get to the airport: train only 2 times a day, otherwise you have to travel 1.5 hours by bus. The airport structure itself is quite modern (built in 2015), good-looking design. There are self-registration machines, luggage storage and other facilities."
3346,5353,"The new terminal in KUF is really fantastic! Modern, large, very good! It was a surprise for me. 10/10!"
3347,5354,Very nice new airport clean spacious and easy to get around. More airlines should use this place as under used. Lots of places to eat and drink. Prices are average in the terminal. Lots of seating around. Free wifi around the terminal brill place to be
3348,5355,"Very nice new airport! Clean, brand new! Great business lounge with a trendy design and a view. Good selection of food and a couple of restaraunts around before and after security control. Alcohol drinks are though not free. No people, airport is nearly empty."
3349,5358,"No more than good. Not comfortable, but decorated. Lacking the service, striving to get more money from you. Try to pack your bag with polyethylene film - they'll ask for EUR 4 - but then you will have to unpack it, because a woman receiving your baggage was suspicious about it and demanded to open the just wrapped bag."
3350,5360,"Connection between airport and city centre by urban transportation is very bad. Buses and trains go very rare. Buses are fulled overlimit, it's impossibly to take by them. Only really way getting to city centre is taxi, which is rather expensive."
3351,5361,"Sochi Airport is too small an airport for such a large flow of people, which is why there are delays in baggage claim"
3352,5362,"The airline's check-in desk was located at the opposite end of the terminal, it was long and inconvenient to walk in the international flight zone. Food and drinks at the airport are expensive. The plane taxied for a long time on the apron (literally 30 minutes). Apparently, because of the repair of one of the taxiways. They found time to complicate the life of a huge number of passengers during the New Year holidays."
3353,5363,"After our flight, 2 more arrived from Moscow, and the passengers of both these flights were given luggage very quickly, and we waited for 30 minutes. And there are very few commuter trains that depart from the airport. For example, there is only one pair of trains per day to Rosa Khutor. Despite the fact that Sochi Airport is now a busy transport hub. But this is still a claim to the railway..."
3354,5364,"The terminal is too small for the such quantity people. Terrible traffic on the way to airport from Sochi centre, 20 km for 1,5 hour by taxi!"
3355,5366,"There was no services in 2014 at night, all shops were closed. Since years, this problem is irrelevant."
3356,5367,Stunning view upon landing. Inside is everything you need for a comfortable trip
3357,5368,Long queues for security inspections. Crowded area in the departure area.
3358,5369,Adler airport in Sochi is beautiful for all parameters excepting its transport accessibility. In the night you can't get/leave there no way but the taxi. I think it's a very big disadvantage.
3359,5370,"Very good airport, and getting to the city is easy, take a bus to the metro and get there in 20-25 minutes"
3360,5371,"St. Petersburg Airport is one of the best airports in Russia, and in my opinion in Europe, it is very large, very strict security control, even on landing, everyone was additionally checked. Very beautiful Infostructure, polite staff."
3361,5372,"At this airport, it is almost impossible to call the desired taxi without problems, because the airport has done everything so that all taxis except its own are simply impossible to work. We could also put seats in the registration area, they are very much needed there."
3362,5373,"Convenient navigation, convenient baggage collection. From the bad - it is almost impossible to call the desired taxi at this airport without problems, because the airport has done everything so that all taxis except its own are simply impossible to work. We could also put seats in the registration area, they are very much needed there."
3363,5378,"Convenient airport, easily accessible by public transport. The inspection is completed quite quickly. There is also wi-fi in the terminals. the only thing is that there are very few outlets, and if there are, you have to stand near them because there are no places to sit"
3364,5380,"There is only one metal detector at the entrance. There is not enough space in the sterile zone for passengers on even one flight. But 4 reception desks worked, everything was fast and high-quality."
3365,5381,"At the entrance to the airport building, the usual introscope did not work, everyone was forced to barely cram their luggage into a small introscope at a height of 1.5 meters above the floor level. In this regard, the queue for one small entrance has only increased. It is impossible to observe sanitary measures, because there are only 3 check-in counters for two flights at the same time. And moreover, the counters are located near the entrance, that is, the queue from the check-in counters creates a crowd immediately after the entrance. There is not enough space everywhere, there are a lot of flies flying, it is stuffy."
3366,5382,Transfer using the vtaxi.info program or via phone +78652998979 It is best to pre-order immediately before departure!
3367,5385,"Beautiful airport, wonderful service. Thank you."
3368,5387,The airport is developing very quickly. It definitely needs to expand in the future. Surgut airport is the main airport in Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug
3369,5388,"Compact airport, baggage carousel is in an inconvenient location."
3370,5389,"Departing zone is small and crowded on the 1 floor. In the morning, when 4-7 flights are departing, it is not comfortable at all. but all in all it is nice small airport!"
3371,5390,"The terminal is small, but very convenient (and why, in fact, you need a big one?). Everything is very simple and clear. The staff are polite, attentive. The toilet is clean. There is a pharmacy, a place for charging phones is equipped, and airline offices are present. Conveniently, there is a telescopic ladder. Special thanks to the service of escort passengers! Worked smoothly, quickly and without nerves"
3372,5392,Is a very comfortable airport
3373,5393,small but new airport
3374,5395,Very nicely renovated old soviet small airport. Absolutely clean and comfortable. It is surprise that how old building can be well maintained and nicely renovated.
3375,5396,"Everything was great but the gate was indicated only in the last minute, which produced a little turmoil among the passengers."
3376,5397,"The security control stays closed until some certain hour. As a result, there was a huge line when it finally opened. Why not let people enter the departures hall calmly and without suffering?"
3377,5398,"Surprisingly, I got my luggage right when I entered the airport and it wasn't damaged! Very quickly."
3378,5399,"I didn't have to wait for my baggage today, because I didn't have it :-) That's why it was fine and I enjoyed Bogashovo and its calm atmosphere."
3379,5400,"Everything was calm and comfortable this time. Bogashovo was quite empty and so there was plenty of space and seats. The registration, passport control and everything else went very friendly."
3380,5401,"Bogashevo is good when you leave but not when you come. My plane was the only one that came at that time but we still had to wait for a long time to get our luggage. Always the same thing. And when you try to get out of the airport, taxists attack you with ""TAXI! TAXI!"" Horrible."
3381,5402,Arriving here is not as pleasant as leaving. Waiting for the luggage in Bogashovo is a horrible thing. Some child by my side felt sick and vomited. I understand the poor thing.
3382,5403,Bogashovo is a small and cozy airport. It's always comfortable to leave from there. Although I wish there were more places to sit while waiting.
3383,5404,Small and cozy airport. And crew there is better than in other airports in Russia. People there sometimes even smile.
3384,5405,"We arrived at the airport in the early morning, we got checked-up fast and got into the waiting hall. It was pretty good with several cafes. (domestic). Gates are very close to terminal and comfortable. Minus is the parking."
3385,5406,О реконструкции аэропорта Рощино можно посмотреть тут. On the reconstruction of the airport Roshino can be found here: http://alexx72.livejournal.com/48831.html
3386,5407,"Oleg, Indeed, the terminal has been in need of reconstruction for a long time. Construction finally started this year."
3387,5409,"An incomprehensibly designed airport, when exiting through the sleeve, first you go down the stairs, then up the stairs, like training after a flight"
3388,5410,Small airport. On international arrival have small “duty free”. On departure have nice duty free. Normal price.
3389,5411,small provincial airport. Single active runway. Procedures are running quite slowly. Did not impressed at all.
3390,5412,"The airport is getting better and better. After reconstruction, it increased significantly due to the expansion of terminal 1. And transport accessibility, as before, is excellent. You can get to the city by bus quite inexpensively and quite quickly."
3391,5413,"There is no connection between passenger terminals 1 and 2. In the second terminal, everything seems to be decent, but it is all assembled as if from Lego cubes and labyrinths."
3392,5415,One of very few Russian airports with smoking lounge near gates. That alone is enough to make anything else not really important ;)
3393,5416,"UFA still offers smoking lounges both for business and regular passengers, disregarding federal legislation for the sake of common sense. Nice job,UFA!"
3394,5417,"After the renovation, you can finally work at airport cafes. Overall airport is cozy and very neat."
3395,5418,"Passengers for Ural Airlines now pass security check and boarding in new built Terminal 2. Very easy and fast! Good interior, caffee and other things."
3396,5419,There is a panoramic view of the planes and the runway. Very modest airport compared to OVB / UNNT Not very pretty inside
3397,5421,"You have to take the taxi witch drop you on the road with your luggages. Then, you have to walk 1km on the road. Good Luck! Otherwise very good airport with very good food (the cheesecake with jam and cream is juste perfectionnement)"
3398,5422,"Getting to airport is easy, there are 3 options: 1) Taxi (900 rubles) 2) Express train from Vladivostok Railway station (350 rubles for business class seat) 3) Public bus from Vladivostok Railway station (150 rubles) Check-in his easy and fast, there are multiple self check-in kiosks and drop-off stand. Security check is fast. 1st check at the enter to airport, 2nd before flight. For faster security check take-off your belt, smartphone and hat and other metal contained items. This will speed up your checkpoint. Good point is that there is no need to remove laptop from backpack. Wi-fi is free all over airport, with mobile phone identification. Cheapest cafe is on a 2nd floor before transit area. in rant zone there is only 2 cafes."
3399,5424,money exchange open at 09:00am. so make sure you have some rubles if you arrive earlier than opening time. or use ATM withdrawing cash.
3400,5425,Flew from old terminal B. In that time it was under reconstruction. This is why the rate is not good.
3401,5426,"The best airport in the Russian Far East I've been so far. Pretty new building with glass walls. Inside having few nice cafes, souvenir shops and even a seafood shop. On your way From/To the airport you can use the airport express train. Time of trip is 48 mins."
3402,5427,"One of the best airports in Russia so far. The new terminal is clean and neat. Really easy to access from the very heart of the city with Aeroexpress train. No scrum, enough space and counters for everyone. Stable wi-fi. Power sockets everywhere (really a lot)."
3403,5428,"Old terminal gave the sence, you like as at home. The new terminal more modern, but not suitable."
3404,5429,"You can get to the airport either by bus (5,67,75) or by taxi. Taxi charges vary, from 350 and above. The airport is normal, cozy, calm, there are places to eat and all that."
3405,5430,"New terminal for FIFA world cup was built. It is not big, but well comfortable. Unfortunately, management is not trained enough yet. Firstly, toilet is dirty, despite on small traffic. Very good thing: railway express is launched. There are few parkings in 5-10 minutes away."
3406,5432,"A new terminal has been opened. Pre-flight formalities are now completed quickly. It’s stuffy in front of the security check area, but everything is fine in the clean area"
3407,5433,"A simple soviet terminal. Automatic registration was recently introduced. Before that, they manually disgraced themselves. Dyutik was opened last year on the second floor."
3408,5434,The airport is currently being reconstructed for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. An international terminal and a new runway are being built.
3409,5436,so-so airport. for a city with a half-trapillion agglomeration. serves 3 large cities and cannot repair it properly. but overall no complaints
3410,5438,"Everything seems to be fine, but the toilets do not have the most necessary thing - toilet paper. So you need to have this with you. But in other respects there are even improvements. The staff has become more friendly."
3411,5439,"In principle, it is a convenient airport that has almost everything you need before and during the flight. There are even smoking booths in the departure area. It is convenient to get to it from the city. The staff is friendly, as long as you don't provoke them. I didn’t check Wi-Fi, since my tariff plan does not limit me on the Internet."
3412,5440,The work of Rospotrebnadzor representatives when meeting the flight was poorly organized. We had to wait a little over 2 hours in line.
3413,5441,Airport is located close to the city. It might take you 10-15 mins to get to the airport from the city center. Even though the terminal is new but terminal facilities are poor - there are only two coffee vendors and two old-style cafes.
3414,5443,"My home airport)) it is very beautiful and very cozy, I recommend it to everyone"
3415,5444,Decent wifi but only works near the exit. Affordable food like kroshka-kartoshka. The vending machine prices are the same before and after security which is great
3416,5445,"Beautiful, modern airport. There is everything necessary for travelers. Large spacious rooms with windows overlooking the airfield and airplanes. There is a place to eat and buy souvenirs."
3417,5446,Modern terminal in One Biulding line-very comfortable to passenger.Very easy to get the terminal from the city-abiut 25 minutes by taxi
3418,5447,"Definitely one of the best airports in Russia. Close to the city, comfortable stay, view of the airfield, modern design"
3419,5448,"The best regional airport in Russia, very spacious, nice, big, lots of shops, many eating places, the free wi-fi, a large free car park. Airport accepts all types of aircraft, it's great. Passenger traffic for more than 4.5 million passengers , many international flights."
3420,5449,"Overall a nice airport. compact, clean, enough seats in the waiting room. Free Wi-Fi. Polite staff at the reception desks. Fast and unobtrusive personal search. There are virtually no queues or crowds of passengers."
3421,5450,"Home Airport, not so bad. Not so large, not so many people, not so far from the city. New building, very fast control, cheap duty free, that more you will be need?###########################################################################################################################################################################"
3422,5466,"A pleasant little airport. Since it's small, you obviously can't compare it to big city airports, but it's nice for its size. I used the executive lounge, which I enjoyed."
3423,5467,"Check in was speedy, security was also speedy but felt very rushed. They didn't want to know about liquids although they made everyone take their shoes off. BA and VA flights were leaving at the same time so they probably wanted everyone through as quick as possible. Security was small so I would imagine this would get clogged up very quickly. If you don't have lounge access there is not much to do at UVF airport once through security. There is some duty-free but it's all pretty expensive (and in $), better off getting it in UK. Food services was pretty dire with overpriced greasy food available plus massive queues and not very many places to sit. Bottles of cold Piton beer were available from the self-serve shop at $5 a bottle and there was no queue. The tannoy announcements were annoyingly loud (and unclear) so there isn't much chance of a quick shut-eye, not that there is the space for it either. Terminal was very small. Free Wi-Fi though so that was a bonus. Overall a small Caribbean airport terminal not really geared up for heavy international flights."
3424,5468,"Getting to the airport over the road is a bit gruelling, since roads can be poor. Using the (expensive) helicopter taxi however is an enormous thrill. Hewanorra is a very small airport, which is an advantage in that waiting times are short, however there's also only a few amenities. Food is mostly fast-food, although the local Piton beer always can mellow my mood. There's free WiFi available, but it's somewhat unreliable."
3425,5469,Nice quiet airport with good view of runway and ramp in food court area.
3426,5470,decent small little airport
3427,5475,There is only a mobile charging kiosk at the place of exit and could not able to connect WIFI with an international mobile number. Baggage was easy to find with tv guidance with the flight number mentioned. The washrooms were very clean.
3428,5476,Easy to access to airport as there are no traffic. Really fast check-in and overall procedure is quick. 2 hours of free Wifi is provided.
3429,5477,The worst thing that happens at this airport is the delay in receiving luggage for incoming international flights of up to an hour and more. The delay is unjustified. The airport administration must move quickly to address this matter.
3430,5478,"The airport is very good, I would even dare to say that it is better than Abu Dhabi (if you exclude the fact that it is in Saudi Arabia). The free wi-fi is really very good!"
3431,5479,I had a booking on a business class but didn't get the access to business lounge because it was closed for some construction work
3432,5480,"I travelled via OEDF too many flights,, WiFi is not free, taxi at airport is a bit at expensive, but buses system is cheap, the fountain at airport is amazing. Overall rating for the airport is fairly good."
3433,5484,A beautiful and modern airport that lacks the variety of amenities and food/retail that other international airports have.
3434,5486,"Big airport, though departure went smoothly. Relative few shops for the size of the airport. Wifi access was only with mobile number which I dislike a lot."
3435,5488,"Transit was smooth, though security and immigration were the most crowded things in my life. the train was nice, and oh the design of the new Terminal 1 was amazing. The Saudia lounge was nice, but the Wi-Fi was trash."
3436,5489,"Better good than my return to CGK, meeting my family and living happily after (also wanted that fried chicken and fries at albaik, it seems like i didnt get it"
3437,5490,"Very good airport with decent shops, stable wifi and ample seating. However, staff is a bit rude towards Indian subcontinent and African citizens"
3438,5493,"For some reason (the new terminal of) Jeddah is one of the most efficient airports I have been to. You almost never wait more than 5 minutes at security, the facilities are modern and well organized, the checkin area is large enough. The public’s WiFi could be better. The SAUDIA domestic lounge is great, the other airline lounges are ok. Food and retail services are ample with the usual offering."
3439,5497,"Nice T5, the check-in was (abnormally) nice, security fast. and lounge good, although the only way to get there was by car, so thats a -"
3440,5501,"Good amenities, decently up to date, however gate waiting areas very overcrowded and restaurants are spread out. Getting to this airport was the most terrifying Uber ride of my life!"
3441,5502,The problem is they are still using buses to pick passenger from terminal to aircraft while there is empty gates at the terminal
3442,5503,The whole riyadh is beautyful this is our home country i love riyadh and i and i love.. THE KING MOHAMMED BIN SALMAN
3443,5505,No access to the gates and lounges by early arrival at airport before night flight at 2 a.m. No seating options for more then 2 hours. Facilities itself very clean
3444,5506,King Khalid International Airport is a really good airport it’s a big airport it’s good for planespotting
3445,5513,"New airport but without many options, the information is a bit confusing, it has to be extremely responsive to any and all movements."
3446,5518,"Not so busy, good flow of people, renovations ongoing, duty free prices are not so good. Security can take some time on some occasions."
3447,5520,"The passport check was finally fast since they finally managed to open more cabins. I hope it stays like this because this was one of the weakest points upon arrival. The only official transfer to the city is by a very small and crampedvan. The driver was visibly on stress beause he was multitasking. The toilet was brand new (one or two months since opened) but awfully maintained, very bad experience. The airport needs improve the toilets and city tranfer as soon as possible."
3448,5521,"The airport is improving but needs a bit more to be compatitive with other airports I usually use. The onlly official airport transfer is by a small cramped van. There is one public transport line which is very unconvinient. Both don't run at early hours even tho there is a large number of morning flights between 6am and 8am. The toilets are new but very awful maintained. However, the airport is getting larger and the gates for this flight were freshly renovated which is the reason for one adittional star in the review."
3449,5522,"Very great experience. Deboarding was fast. Immigration and customs were a breeze, and the parking lot is a very fast walk from the arrivals terminal. Clean terminal as well!"
3450,5524,"My baggage is damaged, and I reported it to the Belgrade airport desk. They made a report, but later I saw that this report is for Turkish Airlines, not FlyDubai."
3451,5525,"Although it is under repair (or building a new one?????), it is very lovely, spacious, and full of light... I liked it :) .. only had some problems with wifi .. thx God for the lounge .. and as for the lounge, quite crowded, also I prefer self-serviced like in Vienna, instead of asking staff for coffee"
3452,5526,"Airport in Belgrad is undergoing rebuild, it is hard to find some places, arrivals hall does not exist in practice."
3453,5527,"Not Finished. And smell inside isn't very nice. Also, very expensive taxi, 2500 Serbian Dinar for ride to old town."
3454,5531,"Not so bad, considering where you are. Bus every 15 minuts for 6 flights a day. Most important tip I can give you, exiting the terminal, buss stop is to the right. The busses park there, look for some chairs welded to the concreet. It looks like a parkinglot, but thats where you get on"
3455,5532,"Good airport. It is small and still not well organized, but it is developing quickly. The workers are friendly, wi-fi is available, there is a little less space before security and passport control, so there are crowds, but I believe that all this will be resolved with the increase in the number of passengers and the renovation that is currently underway."
3456,5533,"Tight, little space before the security check. Important information is not highlighted in the right places. Too many ads. Relatively quick boarding."
3457,5535,You can't expect much from a small island airport but as the description suggest the airport is SMALL! It has very limited food facilities so don't expect anything fancy if doing a layover. Customs are very friendly and helpful and want he process to go as fast as possible. Luckily I was only waiting an hour before my next flight. Wifi is definitely not great.
3458,5536,"The airport is pretty, but there is a huge (the biggest I've ever seen before) queue on the passport control."
3459,5538,Very small airport. Security check you can take all what you want with you. NO WiFi. Because of the small airport there are no buses you had to walk from your Gate to the parking position. Duty Free is not really small.
3460,5540,"Exotic airport, i mean ""open air"" check-in) But its nice and unusual)"
3461,5541,Wonderful place!
3462,5543,"By far the best airport on the planet with the most curteous and helpful staff. Everything that you can think of available, including a swimming pool"
3463,5544,"Unfortunately it took ages to get my boarding pass at the transfer counter, but Singapur Changi in total is definitely one of the best airports in the world. Especially the infrastructure, carpet everywhere and friendly personal is a great plus."
3464,5545,"T4 feels small and not as luxurious as T1. Immigration instead of being at each gate like I remember in the past at other terminals, this is done right after check in like normal airports. There's also great shopping inside, but don't buy anything. Eat Hainanese chicken rice quickly, then go down to the gong and drink the public water fountain like a mine for the first time in your life hahaha. But the checkin agent took too long"
3465,5546,"The airport must be called big and beautiful. Waited 10 minutes for the bus from T4 to Jewel, admiring the breathtaking scenery for 2 or 3 hours straight. Walking from Jewel to the basement of T1 is also tiring. But waiting for luggage took too long"
3466,5547,"I recently visited Singapore's Changi Airport and have mixed feelings about my experience there. On one hand, the airport is incredibly clean and modern. The facilities are top-notch and there are plenty of options for dining, shopping, and entertainment. However, I found the airport to be quite overwhelming and confusing to navigate. The signage could be improved to better direct travelers to their gates and other important areas. Additionally, I found the security and immigration processes to be quite time-consuming and frustrating. Overall, I would give Changi Airport a 3-star rating. While it has its positives, the confusing layout and lengthy security processes were a downside to my experience."
3467,5548,Super nice airport with many palaces to eat different type of foods. There are many things to do with oure family for example go in the buttefly garden. The airport is very clean and have many signs so its easy to find the gate that you have to go to.
3468,5549,"Super nice airport, it feels very tropical and nice when you walk around the airport. There are many things to do with your hole family for example visit the butterfly garden witch is super nice and very cool. There are many differnet places to eat and seat down and talk. It was very easy to find the gate because of the signing around the airport."
3469,5550,Very nice airport that is clean and easy to find the gate in. There was many placec to get different type of foods from around the world. There were many placec to go with youre hole family for exampel a butterflygarden. and you realy feel like you are ina tropical country.
3470,5551,Very nice and clean airport. Super nice to walk around and see the things that you can do whit youre family that suits evrybody. Easy to find the gates.
3471,5552,"Love it. Beautiful airport full of many options for food, fast check-in and security checks as well as great food and lounge service."
3472,5553,"Small airport, with only one place to eat. It works perfectly, there are only about 4 flights a day between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, so there are no lines or crowds. The design is beautiful, spacious and pleasant."
3473,5554,"New airport in service for FireFly. Very easy airport, no hassle as very low amount of people. Very convenient for fast process."
3474,5555,"WOW. What a GEM! Seriously I hope SELETAR get more and more value and traffic. A small but Spotless and Impeccable Terminal, Facilities, staff, Airport. Well Done Singapore"
3475,5557,"The Mastercard Lounge did not have hot food but had an alright drink selection. Security does not open until a couple hours before departure so if you are trying to get to the lounge, wait a bit before going to the airport hours early."
3476,5558,"Small but modern and correct airport. Really satisfied and cosy. I will return to this airport soon. To get to the airport it is 20-30 minutes from the city center which is european standard so it is correct. No extra fee, that's mean there is normal fare for the route."
3477,5559,"Nice experience at Bratislava airport. It is located close to the city centre, it is very clean and facilities are modern. It would definitely deserve to have more flights and destinations."
3478,5560,"I think that the airport's been pretty ok - rather small, but cosy. I guess the only minus is a little uncomfortable placing of sockets in a departures hall. It's kinda sad only that the airport in a Central European capital has so little flights and they rely mostly on very unreliable Ryanair..."
3479,5561,Only one coffee shop serving terrible coffee opened. Probably due to COVID - but it seems like an excuse only.
3480,5563,"Puts many bigger european airports to shame - good bus access, good views, and plenty of seats. Food offerings average, but duty free was VERY cheap."
3481,5564,"Met up with Tomáš before departure in a mall. He had to leave, so we arrived to the airport with bus 61 for free at 17:28, 1h32m before departure. Had to wait for the guy to come to tax free office to stamp my papers. Security had no lines but they took mom's knife from her bag and one cream from Alyona's bag while looking for forks. Passport control had no lines. Tax free letterbox was right after passport control. We arrived at boarding gate 10 around 18:00. Went through boarding together as priority with no problems about bags. Had to wait inside the building before getting on the plane. Alyona stayed at 8F, I changed mom's 20F for 23F and mine 23D for 23E. I sat on 23F. Departed 0h04m late. Flight went without any nerves, mom was listening to music, I did Snapseed. Guy on 23D got drunk and tried to talk to us. Landed 0h05m late, people clapped. Passport control had lines, people dove under the dividers. Took a shuttle bus to Terminal D at 22:45, departed by train for UAH 80 at 23:08."
3482,5566,"Smaller airport, getting to the airport is quite difficult because only one bus line goes to the airport, there are not many food and retail services at the airport."
3483,5567,"This airport does have plenty of rental car services, and two airport cafes. The security area is small, but quick. The post-security area is too small for the number of people, and the shops were closed when I was there (post-pandemic.) The only way to get to the airport is via a bus from the city centre."
3484,5569,Airport in city of Košice is small but very cozy. The security check was smooth and boarding easy and quick. And you always board directly from apron so you get a nice opportunity to see the beauty of your aircraft
3485,5570,Very small airport. Usually does not have more than one plane at the airport. Thanks to this it is very easy to find your way around and it only takes about 4 minutes from the aircraft to the exit of the airport.
3486,5571,Very small airport so you dont have problems with navigation here xD. Check-in staff very kind and you dont have to wait too long for security check like at larger airports. It is sufficient to come to this airport only 60 minutes before the flight. Maybe not so many shopping facilities but i dont mind it...
3487,5572,"I like the fact, that in Kosice they did all check-ins for me (for three flights). I'm not sure if they are so good informated as they should be. I asked about my luggage, if it's going to the Calgary directly. They said yes, and it wasn't true, I had to pick it up in Toronto. (Thanks for Austrian airlines because of good information!) that's everything what I would like to say."
3488,5573,delay 8 hrs
3489,5574,"small, but very nice airport"
3490,5576,"Tiny airport but with the most beatiful views on High Tatras mountain panorama. All required handling services were delivered immmediately. Very helpfull,knowledgeable and friendly staff. Definitely recommend."
3491,5577,Nice small airport with beautiful view at Tatra mountains there is small duty free shop and small bar even little lounge
3492,5578,"Poprad is really small airport with wonderfull view on the High Tatras. All the services are ok, but caffeteria and duty-free could be much better."
3493,5579,The highest airport in Europe with impressive panaroma of the High Tatras. Anything else is very basic and cheap. I managed to reach my evening flight after a day of skiing in Strbske Pleso - what a shame that Wizzair has now changed the schedule for this flight.
3494,5581,Service was excellent! The most beautiful and helpful ladies from handling in this part of Europe. Recommended to visit. The airport facilities are sufficient for this size of the airport. No hustle.
3495,5584,"For this leg assistance was given from the start our mobility compromised friend was wheelchared to the busines lounge without any issues. The lounge was clean and quiet, a nice place to wait for your flight. Food was a little sparse with not ho offerings but many sweet and savoury snacks, a wide range of drinnk both hot and cold."
3496,5585,Our arrival at Ljubljana airport was very smooth although no assistance came for our friend again. Airport is clean and tidy and our luggage came through very quickly.
3497,5586,"After much modernisation Ljubljana aiport is getting much better, new terminal buildings, shopping etc. a one way system is in place on roads surrounding the airport making things safer. There is more a little more shopping and many car rental companies and shuttle buses."
3498,5587,"Good, nice airport just a slow check-in and a lot of walking becazse there is only 1 security station."
3499,5588,Getting to the Airport was OK. Terminal facilities (toilet) were OK and clean). Food Retail services.. Well not much and expencive!
3500,5590,"Easy place to transfer, though immigration can get very busy coming from non-Schengen. Might get nervous, as connection times can be very short (but it will work)."
3501,5591,"Convenient small airport. Second time I transfer here, still didn't find the lounge, but the connections were so short and smooth there was no need. Has nice rooftop bar available to passengers"
3502,5592,"Basic airport, a little cramped in baggage hall, but fast exit from aircraft to pick up. Limited but facilities after exiting customs"
3503,5593,"Excellent small and cozy airport. Swift check-in, careful luggage handling, unobtrusive security. Duty-free offers good choice for those who didn't manage to get souvenirs and local foods/liquors/cosmetics in Ljubljana/Kranj/Maribor/Piran. No plush Ljubljana Dragons, though (the souvenir shop is only a the check-in. Smoking kiosks in clean zones, both EU and non-EU. Guest terrace with runway view. Nearby one of old Adria's DC-6 as a monument. Get there bu slow bus, or faster taxi/minivan from Ljubljana or Kranj, or by car from anywhere."
3504,5599,"Hi, The ground staff always have their radio's turned up full blast. You have no idea how uninterested I am to hear the messages on their radio! Get ear plugs. It's also a security rick to have passengers listening to the in-house messages. Also the ground crew did not tell the front/rear passengers which boarding steps to take so there was confusion in the plane."
3505,5601,"Smaller airport than JNB but which also “gets the job done”. It could have better access to the city center for passengers, even after the World Cup it still leaves something to be desired."
3506,5603,Emigration took way too long (parallel international flights and less counters open) But clean and safe with all amenities. Security check quick but maybe too quick...
3507,5604,Comair/Kulula decided to chack my hand baggage and then broke my suitecase and were not willing to have it repaired. so I was a little annoyed about that
3508,5605,For the food I am referring to the general airport and departure areas. The Emirates lounge and food was very good
3509,5606,Moving from the rental car area to the terminal is a pain but if you are lucky there are golf carts that seem to pick up passangers. The check in security and passport checks are ok. The air side part off the terminal has really great views of the runway. Wifi is restricted and slow but also ok
3510,5608,"A good, modern airport welcoming visitors to Cape Town. More pleasant than the Johannesburg airport."
3511,5609,There was no lounge that was a major disappointment the wifi was good the security was good easy to check-in terminal facilities was wi-fi was a bit slow but only to track planes and chat with your friends food and retail services were good lounge service bad
3512,5610,"It shall be noted that the international departures lounge only has 2 restaurants and 1 duty free shop. Just after immigration is the retail area, to get to the gates, you have to walk along an empty and dull passage, and there are no facilities close to the gates except for bathrooms."
3513,5611,Always very easy to travel through this airport. Check-in is smooth and security and boarding are a breeze. Staff are always helpful and the facilities are always clean and neat. The airport has ample retail facilities and everything that you will need can be found last-minute. Everything in the airport is clearly marked with signage making the airport very user friendly
3514,5612,"King Shaka International Airport is by far the best airport in Africa, the terminal is very user friendly and every thing you need can be found. Going through international passport imagination is a breeze then boarding time on to the departing aircraft is also a breeze!"
3515,5613,Not many shops but efficient
3516,5618,Small viewing terrace
3517,5621,"If possible, try to get into the Bidvest Lounge. There are plenty are choices in terms of food and drinks and lots of seating. It is directly after security on the right. You can access it by having an Absa or Investec Card/Account. There are ore ways to access it, but I can't remember them all."
3518,5622,Has received some new upgraded facilities and a new parking structure. Airport in a very convenient location for JHB North residents.
3519,5623,Super convenient airport! Although be patient nowadays as there is major construction happening near the main terminal
3520,5624,"Just the best airport experience ever. Check in was 5 minutes. Mango staff was very friendly, courteous and professional. Security check was 2 minutes, and having breakfast at Wiesenhof restaurant was just fabulous. It was the best flight experience from an airport. Even arraving back the next night our luggage was ready and waiting for us."
3521,5625,"For such a tiny airport it took a long time to get our bags, even when our flight was the only one at the airport at the time. Didn't seem like there was much in the way of restaurants. It was easy to find Avis. The roads in and out of the airport was easy to"
3522,5627,"Downgrade to H4 business by Frankfurt but upon checking recovery of my seat, very efficient. Virgin Lounge"
3523,5628,"Seemless checking in at Joburg counters. A need to beef up staff and security check personnel. Serious concern about the Customs staff. Need to to get all those desks / cubicles with staff. It cannot be that only 3 staff serve the entire passengers, especially in that afternoon when most international passengers are checking in."
3524,5629,"check-in and security were very fast, wifi was mediocre. a lot of options for food and duty-free. the airplane viewing deck was pretty cool."
3525,5630,"If you are driving to the airport, it can be quite difficult to find the right car parks. Checking in bags was pretty quick but many of the machines were broken. The WiFi was slow but ok for messenger. Security was quick but it can get very busy"
3526,5632,"The airpprt was quick and easy to get to 25 km from my house, the lounge was quite busy in the morning at 09:30-10:15 but it got quieter after that but overall it was good but not excellent"
3527,5633,"Overall a pretty average airport, but certainly in the good side for South Africa. Not much to say except for the free WiFi which annoyed me a lot as it is useless to anyone who does not have a SIM plan there or wants to pay extra for another country’s roaming fees. You have to enter a verification code from either an email address or a phone number to be able to connect which is impossible to ever receive because you don’t have an internet connection in the first place! That is why you are trying to connect! In short you cannot connect with out a SIM plan for South Africa with roaming or an international SIM also with additional fees for international roaming to be able to receive a verification code. Otherwise, some of the staff there are outstandingly friendly and all will help you to where you need to be if you require it. The airport could do with a major clean due to age and many facilities being dirty from very frequent use but this doesn’t make too much of a difference considering once you are through customs and security there are lots of shops managed and cleaned individually and the seats and waiting/resting areas are relatively clean. Toilets are always clean due to the cleaner that waits there and cleans immediately. Overall a good airport to be at but not overly outstanding."
3528,5634,If you don't know your way around make use of the many information desks available. Signage is great and makes finding your way around simple.
3529,5635,The airport has good access to the city center using the train and also has good Uber fares. Airport that can handle demand and offers good infrastructure.
3530,5636,One of my favourite airports. Been flying in and out of here since the mid 60's and it has hardly changed. Nice shopping and plenty of little shops and eateries.
3531,5637,"Quick check-in No lines at security Nice shops Only small bar open for covid, but had nice beer and sausage bread. Boarding took some time."
3532,5638,Sad to see an airport without vibes or life. Not even possible to enjoy a glass of wine or beer after security and immigration checks.
3533,5640,"For once, the whole immigration as well as covid-test check went fast, organized and well. Still the waiting for luggage remains very long. But good experience!"
3534,5641,"i cant complain about the airport itself, Gautrain is good, on time, clean,, just the rest of the country,, crime is high, streets are dirty, once u leave airport third world hit u, blocked drain . streets full of potholes,"
3535,5642,"Just a fantastic airport with public transportation. great eateries, wonderful shops. Lots of seating, open concourses. The way an airport should be."
3536,5643,"Getting to the airport is easy, but during the early morning and close to midday the roads get a bit busy. Check-in was fast and easy, a pleasant smile from the girl at the counter. Security for myself was quick, even at their busiest. The Airport WiFi is fast and there is good connection throughout the terminal. but only lasts for 4 hours and you can only use 1GB. Airlink does not have any lounges themselves or a provider that has a lounge like Bidvest lounges."
3537,5644,"I have been here just twice in the last five years or so and I really think the duty free area here is among the best in the world. Not the biggest, not the most expensive goods. Just good for me!"
3538,5645,Moved from International to Domestic with no problems. Check in was easy and had a drink whilst waiting for the flight
3539,5646,"OR Tambo Airport is pretty easy to negotiate. Didn't take long to get through Immigration, and luggage was reasonably swift."
3540,5652,"A fantastic little airport, not really comparable to others, as it's the gateway to Kruger National Park."
3541,5653,Best Regional Airport in SA. Very Clean and nice looking Terminal Facilities. Great place to wait for your next flight.
3542,5654,"fantastic and adorable! it's super small and you land right in the park, so you see animals everywhere when you land:)"
3543,5655,Most beautiful small airport in the world. Visit it! No wifi and limited food options but luxurious well maintained garden with a fountain.
3544,5657,"Gimhae is quite far but is well connected with the metro and airport buses, the buses were comfy but a little pricy."
3545,5658,There were no lounges or immigration since this was an arriving domestic flight. The location is close to Busan and the airport is okay. They sell delicious fish cakes (grinded fish meatballs with stuffings inside)- special delicacies of Busan which are absolutely delicious.
3546,5659,Senior passengers not accepted as priority people: what age do you have to have in order to be accepted ? I am over 80 !!!
3547,5660,"It wasn't bad, but accessibility tended to be poor like that of the Nopo-dong terminal, and there was a security check and there were only two coffee shops, which was disappointing."
3548,5661,"Used the domestic terminal. Very clean and convenient--super fast check-in and security. Inside quarantine area there isn't much to eat or do, though. Easily accessible by subway and light rail."
3549,5662,"Access to airport was hard by local bus and train (maybe should’ve taken the limousine bus). Check-in was smooth with many self kiosks. The airport was compact, clean and efficient but still spacious like GMP (same company running). Wish the restaurant had better food."
3550,5663,"It's not a big airport, but well designed and not too crowded. They need to make more food stalls etc."
3551,5664,Easy to get to by light rail service. Small airport with limited facilities. Check in staff were not knowledgeable about travel requirements to Japan.
3552,5665,Main gripe about this terminal is accessibility by public transport. One has to walk out of the terminal building to get to the train station which is not exactly the main metro line into town and requires transfer at another station. And it was impossible to buy a through ticket so that was inconvenient as much as it is weird. Otherwise the terminal looked decent.
3553,5666,"nice and comfortable airport, lots of military aircraft."
3554,5668,"Quite large terminal not like other local airport in Korea. can get to the airport within 2 hours in many cities, but less public transportation"
3555,5669,"It was good because it was close to Cheonan. The line was long, so it wasn't good. It was a time of deficit, so it wasn't so good. Free Wi-Fi provided. Paris Baguette is everything."
3556,5670,40 minutes from Cheonan Ordinary local airport Free Wi-Fi service provided Lack of food and beverage facility service - - Inconvenient due to 2 belts
3557,5671,"Accessibility: It was good, 40 minutes from Cheonan Check-in: Asiana ground staff were very friendly Security screening: Very fast as there were no passengers waiting Wi-Fi: Free Wi-Fi service provided Food: Paris Baguette and Yong Udon"
3558,5672,Accessibility was good starting from Cheonan. The Asiana ground staff was friendly and young. The security check went quickly and was very good. The terminal facilities were not good because Cheongju Airport was at a loss due to THAAD. There was free wifi. The store only had Paris Baguette and Yong Udon. I don’t go to the lounge.
3559,5673,"The Most Crowded Airport where people lives in Chungcheong-do(Daejeon, Sejong, Chungnam and Chungbuk)."
3560,5675,"[KR] 군산공항/ 군산 AB는 사람이 별로 없어 좋을뿐더러, 체크인도 빨리빨리 잘 됩니다. 하지만 군산공항으로 가는 버스가 잘 없다는게 단점이죠.. 그것빼고는 참 좋은것 같습니다. 이상이빈다 [EN] Gunsan Airport/ Gunsan AB is good because there are not many people, and check-in is quick. But the disadvantage is that there are not many buses to Gunsan Airport.. Other than that, I think it's great."
3561,5676,"One of the smallest airports in the country, and the check in can take a while if the flight is full."
3562,5677,"Extremely small airport. Since it's a US airbase, no international flight but only domestic to Jeju. Check in to security is very short, but there's nothing to do at the airport terminal. Not enough parking either."
3563,5680,Overall good. But the airport is not open 24 hours. And there is no public transportation running in the early morning. You need to take a taxi to reach the airport to catch an early flight.
3564,5681,"[KR] 제주 국제공항은 다들 아시다시피, 우리 한국에서 큰 공항중 하나입니다. 정말 시설이 좋지만 다시 돌아갈때 체크인, 보안검사 시간이 참 오래걸리죠. 그러니 공항오실때 시간을 많이 두시고 오시는걸 추천드립니다. [EN] As you all know, Jeju International Airport is one of the big airports in Korea. The facilities are really good, but it takes a long time to check in and check security when you go back. So I recommend you to take a lot of time when you come to the airport."
3565,5682,"Arrival is quick, a lot of restaurants to choose from, but the lounge can be improved. A snack bar and some chairs is not up to standard with other domestic lounges in other countries."
3566,5683,Easy to access by car. Complicated as it is before remodeling. Free Wi-Fi provided. Various food courts - - Baggage handling is slow (KAS)
3567,5684,"Couldn't return the rental car at the airport. The guys worked on the ground, but they were friendly. The line was long so it was difficult. It was complicated because it was before remodeling. Free Wi-Fi was provided. There were many food courts."
3568,5685,Accessibility: Rental cars cannot be picked up at the airport Facilities: Complicated as it is before remodeling Wi-Fi: Free Wi-Fi provided Food: It was nice to have a variety of food courts Luggage: It was nice to have Dolhareubang.
3569,5686,The rental car was not picked up at the airport. The facility was complicated because it was before being renovated. The step car had no side cover. Dolhareubang at the baggage claim area was fun.
3570,5687,"Getting to the airport was cheap and smooth by taxi (same as arriving). Had to wait 10 minutes for the checked baggage to go through, longest wait ever. Funny that foreigners had a different security cue for a domestic route. The security itself was smooth. Lotteria burger in front of the gate was convenient for a filling breakfast."
3571,5688,"Good choice of restaurants although nothing special. Airport was close from the town, 10 mins by taxi (less then $10)"
3572,5689,"It’s like Dottegi Market. People from all over the country and even a few foreign tourists... Still, it wasn't that difficult to find a seat as the plane left quickly."
3573,5693,The older airport of Seoul. The terminal is quite small but has more than enough amounts of coffee shops and the seating also okay. The lounge features some cookies and drinks and is and ok since its only used for domestic flights
3574,5695,"Easy access by metro. Simple and easy to navigate terminal. Efficient, compact but still feels spacious and it can handle lots of pax."
3575,5696,"Gimpo Airport was renovated and the facilities were excellent even for domestic flights. Due to the increase in international terrorism, security screening took quite some time. Wifi was a bit slow."
3576,5697,"Great connection by public transport to Seoul City Center. Efficiently organised, Asiana lounge was small but pleasant."
3577,5698,"Vein recognition is very good. Gimpo Airport has poor transportation, so it would be nice if artificial domestic flights were resumed. Receive an Airport Corporation coupon on the 1st of every month if you have it then. First experience of delay in my life (10 minutes)"
3578,5699,I didn't get to see much as I just collected my baggage and went off. I recommend trying to get off the plane fast as immigration took a while.
3579,5701,"Access to WiFi is very difficult. There are few ""free"" hotspots but impossible to connect if you don't have Korean mobile phone number to receive access code via SMS. Staff is not very helpful with this matter telling you to buy access to the ""premium"" wifi, which I cannot be bought due to error on payment page. Ridiculous! Food options are very limited, two restaurants in common area and two cafeterias on the air side. Access to the airport is very convenient but you have to walk for like 10 minutes from the subway station to the check-in area. Overall airport facilities are at most average."
3580,5703,"Huge airport that is well laid out and well run. They have free open sleeping areas for the jet-lagged traveler with a long layover, and decent food options."
3581,5705,Incheon airport has quite good quality and always maintain clean condition. When I went to airport I surprised everytime on the airport.
3582,5706,Incredibly efficient immigration - we were at baggage reclaim within 20 minutes of landing. Luggage took forever and priority labels had no effect ..ours were the last bags to arrive
3583,5707,"Got to the airport using the commuter AREX train, quick enough for the amount of distance covered. Check in was quick and easy, used baggage drop with online check in. Security check took around 20-30 minutes, not the fastest but it was alright. Toilet and terminal 1 was clean, it gets the job done. The food and retail services are good."
3584,5709,"[KR] 인천공항 진짜 좋죠, 세계 공항순위 top 10안에 드는 공항인데. 내부 시설은 진짜 깨끗하고, 직원분들도 친절하십니다. 말 할게 없이 완벽한 공항입니다. 추천합니다. [EN] Incheon Airport is really good, it's one of the top 10 airports in the world. The interior facilities are really clean, and the staff are friendly. It's a perfect airport. Recommend."
3585,5710,"The experience at ICN was as always- amazing. Despite our flight was out of t1, a relatively old terminal compared to t2, the terminal was well maintained and felt new. I would like to talk about how ICN uses high technology to improve passenger experience. The newly introduced ICN smartpass would enable you to use your face ID when entering the TSA zone by just scanning your passport and face saving a lot of time. The airport offers plenty of food and shopping options all around the terminal. The lounge that we had access to was Asiana's business class lounge and we chose the smaller lounge located near gate 26. There were a decent amount of hot and cold food choices and had a lot of beverages featured. The cozy and relaxing seating area was able to accommodate plenty of people during the evening peak hour. Please note though that the main lounge of Asiana is a much bigger, better facility that offers more food options, seating areas, and comfort"
3586,5711,All retail and dining options closed by 8/9pm. My flight was at 0130 and literally couldn't find anything to eat while waiting for my flight. They need to make the retail options operational 24 hours.
3587,5719,"Brilliant. Small but comfortable, fast, with good facilities and well connected to the city. Cozy, like practically all the ""before"" terminals. Spectacular views on landing and takeoff."
3588,5721,"Small terminal but good service, runway being expanded and very good access. The views are simply fantastic and there is an observation deck for those airplane fans. Taxis, bus service, and easy access to the city"
3589,5722,Small but comfortable and fast terminal. The staff is very nice and the airport is quite well connected to the city by bus. Lack of information office. The views of the city of A Coruña and the coast upon landing are fascinating. It's worth the trip just to enjoy those views.
3590,5723,C6 bus from Alicante is so cheap at €3.85 each way. Decent airport with decent facilities - it is quite large too.
3591,5724,A little confusing & hard to navigate - not a lot of amenities or services however it is a small airport so this is to be expected.
3592,5725,"Not happy at all with the Business lounge. Seems as you are in the bassement, no view and very bad service (quality of the food...). Clearly a place to avoid !"
3593,5726,"Good, reasonably quick considering it was a mainly low cost airline hub. Good food services, wasn’t happy about paying €21.99 for a lightning cable."
3594,5727,"Signage is confusing, eg arrow C18 to B12 (rather than alphabetic), arrow signs technically not pointing right direction in Schengen area. Queue was on the limit at 27 minutes through security. C6 bus to city could be made clearer."
3595,5728,"Living in Spain Vueling have become my go to airline as they have great prices and, apart from some boarding queues, excellent service."
3596,5729,I have flown many times with EasyJet and never been disappointed. The flight was one hour late but landed only 30 mins behind schedule. Excellent in flight service and delightful cabin crew.
3597,5731,"Got flagged in security, no communication, staff were shouting at me them it turned out nothing was wrong with me and they shouted at me to go away."
3598,5732,"Car park was a disaster to navigate. Airport is large but easy to get around with loads of facilities. Security was awful and the staff were very rude. Great selection in duty free, wifi was slow. Boarding went on time and ground staff were very helpful and friendly."
3599,5733,"Almería is a bit of a smaller airport than I’m used to, but is good for access and lots of good views for plane spotting. Really enjoyed short walks and queues were not too long."
3600,5734,"Little airport in the south of Spain that grows considerably in summer season. Great flight offer to UK and some other countries in Europe with airlines like Ryanair, TUI, Transavia, EasyJet, Iberia, Vueling, etc."
3601,5736,"Great little regional airport. Good proximity to the city, 15 minutes by bus or car. Clean, has a shop and something to eat. Beautiful view as you walk out on the tarmac and see the sea. On the first floor there is a nice little terrace to spot your plane."
3602,5737,"It's a bit like landing back in the 60s. Very much an aerodrome, simple and not particularly attractive. Good luck if you're relying on public transport to get to town..."
3603,5738,It is a fairly small airport. It doesn't offer many services (thanks to its size) but that's okay because it is located quite close to the capital. Almería Airport is one of the most comfortable and clean in Andalusia. It's a rather small airport. There aren't many services (because of its size) but that doesn't matter because it's so close to the city. Almería's airport is one of the cleanest and most comfortable airports in Andalusia.
3604,5740,"Oh my god, is very good"
3605,5742,"Asturias Airport is a little airport about 30 minutes - 1 hour away from the big cities. You can get to the airport by bus, which departs every hour. Be punctual, as it leaves exactly on time. The check-in area is small and there aren't long queues. Next to it there is the security checkpoint which you can pass in a matter of seconds. There are 2 shops (one of them a duty free) and 3 cafés, one on the arrival area, one in the departure area and one past the security checks. There is free WiFi, provided by AENA. Overall, it is a nice airport without long waiting times and difficult to navigate terminals."
3606,5743,"A small airport where it is easy to get around. As soon as I got off the plane I found my suitcase waiting on the belt. They have several cafes on the first floor. I recommend speed to avoid missing the buses that leave to Xixón/Avilés and Uviéu almost punctually every hour and do not wait. If you have time, stop at the entrance at the bottom of the airport and you will see some interesting works such as the madongiro and outside the airport a traditional Asturian bread basket with wooden details."
3607,5744,Good connection link for a small airport (ALSA bus to Oviedo and Avilés/Gijón). No lounge. Only one cafe and duty free shop airside. No lounge. Free WiFI.
3608,5745,"A small regional airport, was put aside by security at ""random"" but they were very polite and informative, non intrusive."
3609,5746,Small but cozy airport with amazing views during take off and landing over Asturias' coast. small duty-free area on the departures upper level where you can buy local products. Good information about airport news through the independent website www.AeroAsturias.com also on facebook and twitter (@AeroAsturias)
3610,5747,Good small airport which has an excellent cafe. Just a shame that the shop selling local products shut down during the recession. Relaxed atmosphere though and good view of airfield in the small upstairs departure lounge.
3611,5748,Super small airport but with great services and nice people ready to help us. great.
3612,5751,"Nice airport, although the vueling self check in was rather annoying & wouldn’t accept my boarding pass so I had to find my booking reference. However, the airport lounge (Jose Miró) was very nice. Being the only non Schengen lounge, it was our only option & it did not disappoint."
3613,5752,"A good airport but Check-in has a problem, because Check-in for special/disabled packages that can have up to 6 people is slower than a line of 180 people"
3614,5753,"BCN is a good airport, is cleaned it have many shops realatee to the city and many more things like playgrounds for the kids."
3615,5756,"Very large, accessible and welcoming airport. Overall very good reception. The wifi is complicated and doesn't work very well so please rectify that but other than that, no problem???????"
3616,5757,"All processes worked fine for me. Signs to the lounge could be placed a bit better at T1, but in the end I made it there."
3617,5758,I did not like the new self check-in procedure. Now travelers have to do the job of airport check-in personel. But the prices of flight tickets should be decreased. I want to be refund because I did the check-in of luggages myself. This is not my job.
3618,5759,Luggage claim was good not many issues. Also the acsessability around the airport was execelent. Lastly the resteruants were decently priced and tasted good.
3619,5760,Deplaning and baggage claim was very smooth and fast. We quickly got our baggages and were out of the airport in less than 15 minutes after getting of our flight. WiFi was not very smooth while trying to get my phone's roaming to work but in the end it worked.
3620,5761,"Bilbao airport (BIO) is a great airport were you can find everything you need, I like how the arquitect made it because it have a ""modern"" shape"
3621,5762,"Overall Terminal facilities were clean and it's not that much of a big airport, didn't check out at all Food or Lounge stuff, for baggage claim the services are pretty quick and you can get your bag within 5 minutes. After you claim your bag just walk out around 200 m and you are already outside to get ready to explore Bilbao."
3622,5763,"Starbucks, then only Burger King, that was disgusting again. But Wifi very good. Even toilets - everywhere and ok."
3623,5765,"Unique airport, small but realy functional. Usualy IT isnt crowed and the Security Check is really fast."
3624,5766,"Original AF flight cancelled due to engine problems - re-booking appeared chaotic/disinterested for the first 20 min, but turned out to be most efficient and pleasant. Passengers sent off to bar armed with a voucher, then 20-30 min later we were given instructions, proceeded to appropriate check in desk and went on our way. A lot more civilised than standing in a queue for 2-3 h to max points to the airport and Air France"
3625,5768,One of the coziest airports
3626,5769,Baggage delay.
3627,5770,1.5 lt water thru customs
3628,5772,Getting out of the plane and letting the hot air hit you is amazing and I don't realy have anything bad to say about fuerteventura it was all realy good
3629,5773,"not enough seating when busy. Not much food choice. Security is very ""manual"" and means you have to phyically move multiple trays whilst standing on a slippy floor without shoes"
3630,5774,"Out of season, airport relatively quiet. No fuss baggage collection and straightforward passport check. Large and well signed coach park opposite terminal entrance."
3631,5776,Loved the island the resort was really good and very helpful beaches unbelievable gold sand beaches food was brilliant
3632,5777,Small airport but decent facilities for its size. Borders were very smooth bags took quite a while as did check in.
3633,5778,"Food in terminal very expensive. 10 Euro for a sandwich and a soft drink. Then if you want a snack for the flight be prepared to pay 3 times what you would normally expect to pay at supermarket. Large bag of crisps 3 Euro, bag of wine gums almost 5 Euro"
3634,5779,Landed at almost at the end of business day so no queues for us and the baggage was claimed quickly. The only thing bad was that the WIFI was not functional
3635,5780,"Great airport, nice and small. Check in poor and slow and always something is broken. Security are really abrupt. Ryanair queues ridiculous! Ryanair - do t rush to gate for priority boarding because everyone joins same queue! Shops are fine and the fact you can sit out in the sun is great. Food is expensive."
3636,5781,"very slow check-in and security check. After that, there are many options to eat or buy something but there are only a few seats to sit down while waiting for Boarding.Wifi 30 minutes free- average."
3637,5782,"Went here for my holiday, its a beautiful airport. We left the airport by taxi since our aircraft was late and we missed the last bus, and on our way back used a bus. The taxi and bus ride to and from the airport, it was not expensive at all."
3638,5784,"Nice airport that handles Ryanair flights and Smartwings. I can tell you, they have future proof it and has lots of room for expansion. The ques at security were nothing and they have their own custom branded café which is nice!"
3639,5785,"I liked a Huge smoking section after the security with bar and good beer and really didn't like the internet at the airport ""Free"" wifi ...yes it is for 15min ?! Than it is like 4.5€ per 30min 5.5€ per 45min ...I was disappointed"
3640,5786,"Clean and comfortable airport. Security check was very quick. There is paid WiFi (like at most Spanish airports), but the McDonald's also offers free WiFi. There are good bus connections to/from both Barcelona (Arc de Triomf metro station) and Girona (train station)."
3641,5787,Nice small airport. Bus station was opposite the airport.
3642,5790,"smal airport, 16E bus transfer to Barcelona"
3643,5793,"gran canaria airport is one of the best airports ive went to, super easy security, good shop and was fun to run around in. the only problems were the delay (about 1 hour, not that bad), people lying down on seats and the burger king line overall, i give gran canaria airport 8/10"
3644,5794,Las Palmas is a beautiful airport from the plane landing and taking off the the drive in and out you can plane spot. The airport is Very clean and tidy not to busy either which is good for big families like mine The security agents don’t talk much when I go but they seem friendly
3645,5795,"If you’re travelling with Ryanair, make sure to read the signs. We spent about 10 minutes looking for the check-in area which was in fact downstairs. You certainly won’t lose your passport. It is checked constantly, especially if you are travelling to a country outside of the EU. You will be kept in a ‘pen’ until you board. Other than that, everything else was okay."
3646,5796,"Check-in went smooth with friendly personel. Security check was bad, rude and conflicting orders from employees. Seating at gate was okay."
3647,5797,"Passport control was slow. A lot of uncertainty, staff kept changing what they were saying. Border force were friendly."
3648,5799,-good connection with bus and taxi -easy Check-in and security check -Terminal is a little bit dirty
3649,5800,Quick and easy. Although the bus driver from the aircraft to the building needs to go easy on the brakes
3650,5801,WiFi remembered me from last time. E-gates were a bit hit and miss but clear instructions from staff. Baggage came through fairly swiftly!
3651,5802,"Little and functional airport, with all that you need for short stops and it's practical to get there (buses are not expensive at all)"
3652,5803,"It's totally and completely adecuate for a small regional airport, but it could have more services now that is growing."
3653,5804,13.20
3654,5805,Unfortunately the lounge is closed. Bus connections to the airport available. Super easy with a rental car. Long queues in front of check-in. No waiting time at the security check. Good free WiFi. Lots of vending machines with water and snacks and a Paul baker.
3655,5806,A small old fashioned airport . Easy to find your gate. Security ques are long on high season and not many shops/restaurants.
3656,5807,"Arrived at Ibiza in quick notice of the bad smell and dirty shuttle bus. Not overly impressed but satisfactory. Was a very busy and crowded area, bit claustrophobic. Wi-Fi was rather bad as only about 10 mins free with sign-in if I can remember. The customs were great as the border control were very polite and kind as I went through. Overall it was good but clear improvement needs to be made"
3657,5808,"Small and human sized airport. Really enjoyed my experience at this airport. large windows in boarding areas offers great views, quick lugage delivery, great servicing, clean, many shops, etc... although it should be a very crowded and busy airport in summer we had a great experience in october!"
3658,5810,"Ibiza is a very beautiful island that has two sides, the quiet side, for example Santa Eularia, and the other, the San Antonio festival. The airport is sophisticated as it has a modern structure and is silent."
3659,5811,The Average Spain Airport.Check In Was Short And Quiet.Security Was Also Short And Quiet.The Resturants Were Average.Not Much Shops Open In The Morning At 8 Am.Many People were at the resturant waiting for its flights.
3660,5812,Ibiza is great everywhere!
3661,5813,Long queue at this shitty airline.
3662,5814,"Usual Spanish airport but quite quick to get through, although took a little time to find our transfer coach."
3663,5817,The best airport of all
3664,5818,"Nice, small airport. Nine gates only. Short ways. Outside terrace. Basic catering and shoping options."
3665,5819,"Its a small airport, not many shops about 2 when you pass through security. 2 cafes hardly have anything in. No premium lounge either."
3666,5820,"Very basic airport, although security was fairly quick, the airport in places felt like a prison with small concrete rooms and metal toilets. Not much in the way of restaraunts, but as a basic airport it gets the job done"
3667,5821,"Due to the pandemic, there wasn't much going on, so both the check-in and the security check went very quickly. The spot check with the “explosive strip” was a bit intense for my taste. Toilets were clean, food was at the usual inflated prices. The free WiFi was absolutely fine, but unfortunately there is no lounge. The windows of the airport could do with cleaning again, not nice if you still want to take photos of airplanes on the apron (if you're into that)"
3668,5822,"Good airport, but if you lost something here - is so small chance to find it with people on airport - some peoples from airport helping, but not do a lot. Howeveer, good and clean airport."
3669,5823,Wonderfull little airport. There is everything you need and you will find a clean Terminal (except some sofas near the gates). The toilets are clean and dont smell like the typical airport toilets. Unfortunately there is no lounge at the airport since this is mostly a regional and touristic airport
3670,5824,Toilets a bit manly but everywhere else clean and good amounts of pleases to eat and drink. The water stations are conveniently located.
3671,5825,"Everything was pretty smooth, however, check-in had a lot of issues - it took about 40 minutes. WiFi was poor, very slow and requires you to enter your personal details so they can send you offers. Shops were expensive though there was a lot there. Duty Free was also good. Security was smooth and simple, no problems."
3672,5826,"Fast security times, and easy to navigate airport. When travelling with low cost airlines, they even gave us a jet bridge. Baggage took a while, but not too long."
3673,5827,I had no complications. The terminal was just full with pax. But the Security check was still fast: It took 5 minutes!
3674,5829,"Lanzarote was a great airport have to say check in was a huge area . Before checking in I used the toilets which were clean I didn’t spell bad so 5 stars for check in and toilets getting to the airport was no problem because I got the buss from my hotel . The WiFi was average speed but it was good anough for a few hours. Security was quite small and fast so 5 stars. Terminal facilities, was great it had money exchanges car rentals and more duty free was good as well they have a Large Burger King and a sandwich shop my family used Burger King but I used the sandwich shop and had a meat feast it was quite small the main terminal 3 eating places and 4 shops and it was all next to the gate . Longe, the longe was really nice and you could book online so 5 stars for the lounge . Baggage claim was good not a problem 5 stars . Boarding , when I arrived 1 week earlier I got the bus to the terminal but other stands you walked and some others there were air bridges I had an air beige . Lanzarote 5 stars"
3675,5830,A very pleasant airport. It is relatively small airport meaning everything is accessible. Water fountains and shops are available. Lots of seats and space and is never overcrowded.
3676,5831,The arrival is a very pleasant experience. Most gates have a jet bridge for good access for wheelchairs. Passport control took a very little amount of time. Very efficient and quick
3677,5832,Nice small airport with a terminal easy to navigate; the shops are right next to gates! Avoid however if you don't like hard landings and turbulent takeoffs due to the constant northerly breeze.
3678,5833,Nice small airport with a terminal easy to navigate; the shops are right next to gates! Avoid however if you don't like hard landings and turbulent takeoffs due to the constant northerly breeze.
3679,5837,"Metro and rail connections are available to all terminals. Customs is quite easy. But prepare to walk, cause the airport is huge. Especially Terminal 4!"
3680,5839,Love T4 but T2 left a lot to be desired. Fast track immigration not open and generally dark and depressing
3681,5840,"If leaving from TS, make sure to arrive 3 hours before departure as it takes a long time to walk to the gate. Check in and security were a breeze and the airport is BEAUTIFUL! AA customer service there was also A++"
3682,5841,"Hard to exit after arrival. Strange that departures mix with arrivals. Easy to get into, but need to pay attention for extra subway fee. Nice self ride train between terminals."
3683,5843,"Excellent airport, very comfortable, large and spacious, connection with metro, taxi, Uber and public transportation, the airport has 4 air terminals."
3684,5844,"I got my first glimpse of what life outside the EU was going to be like. While transferring through MAD I saw with dismay the winding queue at immigration. This changed to relief when I saw that it was for non-EU citizens and the immigration channel to the right was for EU citizens was queue free. I became dismayed again realising that if I passed through this airport again, I would be in the long queue. MAD is a hub for flights from Central and South America to Europe. At my time of arrival, several other flights had arrived from these locations. The airport does not seem to be geared up to handle large numbers of non-EU citizens at once."
3685,5845,"As my baggages had the Sky Priority benefit, I can take my baggages at the arrival among the first. Fortunately, I can claim my baggages very quick."
3686,5851,"Very nice and functional airport, with a lot of light. Didn't use the checkin nor the lounge, but security was a breze. A 20 minute delay that wasn't noticeable. Overall, very good. But I had trouble connecting to the wifi."
3687,5853,"Airport very modern, clean and nice. Most flights were departing on time. WI-FI wouldn't work on my phone. After check in there were long queues for security, and was quite confusing where to go. These were the only negatives, overall nice experiance."
3688,5854,"Menorca Airport was easy to navigate through and overall the experience was good. Check-in and security was smooth and quick. The terminal appearance was light, clean and modern. Retail facilities are the usually duty free and local goods shops. There is a variety of restaurants from cafes to fast food outlets. There is also a smoking area at the start of the departure lounge, which is an unsual thing within an airport terminal. Planespotting in the terminal building is pretty good as well from 3 locations in the departure lounge. These locations are at either end of the terminal's piers which offer views of aircraft taking off or landing. These two locations also offer a limited view of the apron with the northern end providing a view of only a few stands, while the southern end provides views of the control tower as well as views of general aviation apron. The best location is situated at gate 5, where there is also a stair case down to the lower levels. From here, you get a better view of the apron and can get easy shots of aircraft taxiing. It of course offers views of the runway, however at either runway threshold the view can be obscured. There can also be alot of haze when taking runway shots."
3689,5855,"Mahon, Menorca airport is small but efficient with average number of check-in desks. Security efficient directing you to nearest scanner. Air-side has a number of good coffee shops, but food seemed above normal prices and there are also a number of fast food outlets, with a children's okay area. Car rentals a short walk from terminal, but queues can be long"
3690,5856,"New, small, beautiful!"
3691,5857,Toilets were a bit off Didn't use wifi Burger king was massively crowded Waited 20+ minutes for 2 fries and a drink Passport control was easy Baggage claim was easy
3692,5858,"Better than my outward journey but a very busy airport and I found that most of the staff weren’t very nice, but I understand it was a hot day"
3693,5859,"The queue to bag drop was very long, security only took 2 minutes. Wide selection of restaurants and shops."
3694,5860,A good airport and terminal overall. Only issue comes when is time to buy tickets at the train station. It's ridiculously long - it will probably take you longer to buy the train tickets than the train ride itself.
3695,5861,Check-in was very easy and simple. Got to security and breezed through. Terminal was slightly busy but many flights also departing. Did passport control which took less then 5 minutes. Had to change gate due to orginal one not working.
3696,5862,"Bag drop had a long queue. Understaffed. Security was poorly organised. Long queue, uncoordinated staff. Not particularly smart in how things were being organised. Needs better approach to cope with busy periods. More staff needed. Better trained staff needed. Fewer staff in Duty Free, more staff on Security and Check In."
3697,5863,Food and Drink is extremely expensive. I don't understand this. A coffee is more than double in price then in the city.
3698,5864,"airport was fantastic the staff were very friendly and polite. There was plenty of parking. the shops once passed security were pretty good offered a wide variety of items, I didn't buy anything tough, but I did look about"
3699,5865,"Flight delayed 1.5 hours, but no info from the airport - not even on the information monitors or the airport app."
3700,5866,Passport Control is too slowed and poorly organised. The queue doesn't get separated into European and non-European passports until basically the end of it.
3701,5867,Why don't they recover flights with northern Spain? I loved flying direct from Santiago to Melilla on PauknAir's BaE-146
3702,5868,The first time Melilla was connected to the north of Spain was in the 90s with PauknAir. Comfortable flight on the BaE-146. It's a shame that only turboprops fly now.
3703,5869,"Unique airport, small but realy functional. Usualy IT isnt crowed and the Security Check is really fast."
3704,5870,"Melilla is a bit of a smaller airport than I’m used to, but is good for access and lots of good views for plane spotting. Really enjoyed short walks and queues were not too long."
3705,5871,"It's totally and completely adecuate for a small regional airport, but it could have more services now that is growing."
3706,5872,"Currently, the airport's category has been changed to Category 3C but the length of the runway has not been extended nor has an approach for 3C jet aircraft been published. This is limited to ATR turboprop aircraft. Why don't they expand the runway of an airport with more than 500,000 passengers/year?"
3707,5873,"ATR72 full of passengers at 29ºC has a takeoff distance of 1,853m, Melilla having 1,400m of takeoff distance, the maximum weight it can take off is less than the maximum, therefore, the wind, temperature, weather conditions and Above all, the dimensions of the runway penalize the payment burden for that flight. Expand the landing strip so that Airbus 320s and Embraer 190s can fly."
3708,5874,"Great little regional airport. Good proximity to the city, 5 minutes by car. Clean, has a shop and something to eat. Beautiful view as you walk out on the tarmac and see the sea."
3709,5875,"Little and functional airport, with all that you need for short stops and it's practical to get there (taxis are not expensive at all)"
3710,5876,I absolutely adore Melilla airport staff are so lovely and try their best to adapt even with language barriers I had a child on board with me and an extra suitcase that was a cabin bag the lovely lady there said she would put it in hold for us because we payed for a pram amazing service !!!
3711,5878,"Airport nice and clean, not many services though. Not as good as old murcia airport, changed boarding gate once."
3712,5879,"Could do better!! Some more establishments open airside, but a 40 minute queue in Subway is not acceptable. considering it is the only eatery airside, more capability needs to be introduced. No overly impressed that main toilet doors open directly into the area, any joe public walking by can look straight in."
3713,5880,"Quick passport control and baggage reclaim on arrival. Beautiful, modern terminal building. The airport is clearly operating well below capacity, as it is very quiet. It does seem the airport is ""in the middle of nowhere"", so taxi and car hire are probably the most used transport connections for visitors. The landside facilities are ok - nice, clean coffee shop to wait in. No issues with either check-in or security. Airside food and retail is not extensive, but should be absolutely fine for most. There seemed to be plenty of seating and the toilets (and terminal) were clean & tidy. Overall, a great passenger experience."
3714,5881,New airport and very disappointing facilities. One Costa coffee shop and WH Smith outside and only a WH Smith and duty free past security. Hopefully will improve in the very near future. Security are also not making people remove liquids from their hand luggage before going through the scanner.
3715,5882,"The Check-in attendants were very helpful and comprehensive with me, giving me the information for the flight as they were delayed, while I was putting some things on my baggage, and offered me to free check in my handbagage, despite I had checked in my other baggage, even without receiving a warning o high occupancy and having even the priority boarding thanks to my status. As I had many things in my backpack, the security people helped me also to put again my things. Also, I got a free Ice Cream while dining in the restaurant. I was lucky."
3716,5883,One of the cleanest and most accessable airport that I have ever been to. Great food/duty free and transport links. No other option to get to the island so at least it isnt negative
3717,5884,"Great airport, bigger than expected. Security a breeze to get through. Enjoy the shopping experience prior to fligh"
3718,5885,Very big airport but the signs and the way to the boarding gate is easy to understand. So I appreciate. We can see a lot of different plane and it’s si cool !
3719,5886,"Good airport, nice shops, nice staff. Third biggest airport in Spain. Got ways to get in the airport even if you're on the other part of the island. VERY expensive food."
3720,5888,Flying FROM Mallorca home was a total pleasure. Check in was already opened when we arrived at the airport and only 1 family was ahead of us. We where there early but so where the check in guys. So no long waiting times. Even the security checkin was very quick and they even showed the approximate time of security check and time you need to get to your gate. Changing diapers was a pleasure in the facilities. The even had a comfy chair there for breast feeding. Great airport!
3721,5889,Really good facilities and staff at the airport check-in took a bit of time but other than that it was all good
3722,5890,There was a pretty long line in front of the security but it still went pretty fast. took about 15 till 20 minutes to get fully trough security. after you passed security it seemed so much less busy inside
3723,5891,"Pretty clean, WiFi is slow however and at places it‘s crowded. Has a medium selection of stores like a large Dufry DutyFree (among with a few smaller ones) and a electronic store."
3724,5893,Getting to the airport was simple enough as we all had transfers from Jet2. Would recommend heading to Barcelona Airport and just making the hour travel down to Reus/Salou. A super small airport. The Security seemed extremely inefficient and inexperienced. better when you are departing compared to arriving. It wouldn't waste money in the singular open food place as it all was overpriced and tasted horrendous. *
3725,5895,Basic look but check in was fast security was fast priority fast track exists there first on the plane
3726,5896,"A small regional airpot with only 3 or 4 shops. (2 either side of security) what really makes this airport is the staff who are amazing, and the convenience accessing portaventura and the Costa Dorrada"
3727,5897,"Took forever to get to the check in desk as only 1 was open got to about 10 passengers left to check in ad they decided to open another one meanwhile with everyone stood there an alarm was going off and a door closed people were stood around wondering what it was and nobody was told. In the terminal I have to say the worst duty free stock you can find and not much to eat either. However, to end on a positive note going through security is usually to most dreaded part but in my case this was the best part of it! We were see to straight away and as the scanner does randomly, I myself was selected for a random explosive swab however I was quite young then so they had to inform my mum they did not do this is a rude tone whatsoever and usually people would feel embarrassed if this happened to them but the security officer made something that would usually be a bad experience into a positive side which makes it the best part of the airport in my opinion."
3728,5898,"Flew from Gatwick with a backwind, from lift off to touchdown 1 hoiur 22 minutes fantastic on the coach in 30 minutes Thompson holidays, who needs Low cost Airlines, overpriced and dirty.Ryanair flight was more expensive than Thompson late deal which included transfer and baggage"
3729,5899,"Being one of the smallest airports i have been to i was very impressed with how good it was. As soon as we landed we were taken straight to passport control and by time we passed though our bags were already coming around the baggage carousel. On departure the security checks were really quick and the small departure lounge was great .. A food counter, duty free outlets and plenty of seating"
3730,5901,a bit small but overall was great flew from Prestwick for a holiday in salou. but takes 10 mins to find baggage claim and passport control. overall was great but needed a few more shops after security. security checks were great.
3731,5902,"Everything very fast and orderly, they have reopened the cafeteria and it is a pleasure!! A basic items store is missing."
3732,5903,"Little airport but everything is very fast, only 5 minutes check-in and in 10 minutes ready to board the plane. Nice Cafeteria with platform and runway views."
3733,5904,I think it is important to provide free wifi at all airport facilities. This airport could also support more flights. The shop is reasonably good and the bar should widen its food offer variety and opening times. This is a very good and convenient airport
3734,5905,It lacks water sources to refill bottles after the control and space to change babies in the bathrooms
3735,5906,Small yet effiecient airport - a 20min ride by public transport to the downtown area. Spotless airport and friendly staff. 4 gates and stunning landing/take-off views. Make sure to get a window view :)
3736,5907,"The Santander airport is very good, the restaurant prices are low and the food is very good. Regarding the staff, they are very nice and the airport infrastructure has two jetways/glass walkways, the arrivals hall has three pick-up belts luggage, (V.I.P room under construction). In general, Santander airport is very good for being a secondary airport."
3737,5908,Lost lots of time to get Avis rental car - better take any other. Duty free is just one restaurant and shot.
3738,5909,"It's a small airport, but it has many flights to different countries. The most importat airline in this airport is Ryanair, but it also has Vueling and Iberia. It's close to the city centre, and there are many buses to get there every 30 min, from 7.00am to 11pm. There are also Alsa buses that link the airport to Bilbao, Gijón, Oviedo, Laredo..."

3740,5914,Good bus service to nearby city
3741,5915,The airports has all facilities unless the conecttions are distressfull. You can only trip by bus or taxi.
3742,5916,"Perfect and very comfortable, but the check-in area is slow and sometimes the information displayed on the monitors does not correspond to the final check-in counter"
3743,5917,"In general my opinion is very good. The airport is not very big, but you can found fresh food (vegetables, fruts, etc) and meals maked at establishment. The local is pretty."
3744,5918,"Excelent as always. --GOOD-- Premises, cleaning, personnel, security, signage, taxiing on apron, buildings, terminals, facilities. --BAD-- The truth is, nothing."
3745,5919,"Modern, intuitive, comfortable. This was my experience at the Lavacolla/Santiago de Compostela airport. The bathrooms and other facilities are spotless. BRILLIANT."
3746,5920,Very lovely airport. You can walk from one side to the other side of the airport In 10 minutes or less. My feeling is that if you are connecting through this airport you would need at least 45-1 hour 15 minutes depending on the airline. This airport has great design. The best part are the big windows especially If you like looking at planes.
3747,5921,Waiting room with views of the track. Very slow wifi. Incredibly expensive cafe. The airport bus has many unnecessary stops.
3748,5922,"It is a wonderful airport but when there are a lot of people at the hand luggage checkpoints they have to open all the checkpoints, not leave just one checkpoint to go through, since the line is very long. Other days they open them all and other days they don't."
3749,5923,"If you have some time, stay in cafe in the hall, just next to the bus stop. There are super comfortable chairs with tables, you can work / relax as you wish."
3750,5924,"While it's a relatively small airport it's very spacious, modern, and lovely to be in. Because it's small and security is easy there's no need to arrive super early so the services and food options aren't as important."
3751,5926,Long queue for only two Transavia incheck dess. Everybody has to check in old school because this airport does not appear to support online check-in.
3752,5927,"Too many lines at the security check. They were not prepared for the rush hour, and the control staff at the turnstiles were very unprofessional…"
3753,5928,"Good enough, small airport. Has enough facilities but there is room for improvement. For the size of it, it is very good."
3754,5929,The airport pretty it’s having an big ampliation with another terminal. Right now the airport is pretty big with lot of food and shop options and large seating areas. Being pretty spacious
3755,5930,"Good and east yo use precises. Nevertheless, this airport needs more facilites un what regards drop-off and pick-up passengers when using prívate cars."
3756,5931,Great little airport. Has super quick security. Has decent food options with a cafeteria style restaurant. Great views
3757,5932,You quickly arrive at the boarding gate. The security check is quite fast. It needs a commuter train or more bus frequencies. Usually pretty good. Wide range of flights.
3758,5933,"Se llega de forma fácil y barata con el autobús especial aeropuerto (4€). No hay mucho que hacer en el aeropuerto ya que hay solo 2 bares y el duty free es pequeño; aun así, al ser el aeropuerto de mi ciudad le tengo cariño. Going to the airport is easy by the special airport-bus. There are only 2 snack bars and the duty free so waiting at this airport is a bit boring."
3759,5935,The security check was very good and the personal of the airport help you in all what u need. Very good airport.
3760,5936,"The airport is near the city and taxis don't cost much. When I arrived to the airport almost 2 hours before my flight, I saw in front of me a HUGE queue for check-in that made me wait for over AN HOUR."
3761,5937,"I love this airport. Recently remodeled, it is not one of the largest in Spain, but it is very comfortable and functional. To go to the north of the island it is ideal since it is located just 20 kilometers from Puerto de la Cruz and 12 kilometers from the capital Santa Cruz de Tenerife"
3762,5942,Nice airport with easy access to coaches or car rental. Check in and security efficient. Although there are food and shops before security very little airside.
3763,5943,"The airport is not really cleany, there aren't too munch shops and i almost break my luggage wheels. But other things are really good."
3764,5944,"Check-In was a bit slow, some problems but overall okay. Nice new terminal features. The non-Schengen area had no shops except for a few vending machines. Very poor."
3765,5946,although the terminal was quite stuffy. the airport was very welcoming and i really liked the atmosphere.
3766,5948,Decent arrivals experience - nice and quick But staff were a bit careless with the STPH (mine wasn’t checked at all but family kinda was)
3767,5950,"At saturday there was too many people to feel comfortable in a pandemic situation. The Check-In with Edleweiss durates very long, nearly half an hour standing. Security Check waiting time was okay, but also too many people. I was a bit sad, because I had to put out really all electronic devices from my backpack, not only the notebook like at other airports (drone, batteries, compact.camera...). It was really strict."
3768,5951,"The flight was late by around 1 1/2 hours but the waiting was fine and semi-comfortable, check-in had good service and security check was without bigger problems. They sorted my backpack out for around 10 minutes, but after that I got it back without complications"
3769,5952,"Usually no customs at the boarding gate to UK flight, so the BA staff assist me to call the customs staff. Because I need the stamp in passport that I see the customs not willing to do, finally he stamp to almost last page……"
3770,5953,"All round decent airport, check in can get very congested so id suggest arriving early if possible. Prices for food are rather high before security, seemed more reasonable at the gates."
3771,5955,Security really!!!!!! Needs to be Improved. My flight home got delayed 2 hours because of security delays. It's a good airport still :)
3772,5956,"It is very easy to get to the airport on the metro. We had a lot of issues with finding where baggage from a cancelled flight was being directed, and just where to go in general after a number of cancellations."
3773,5957,"VIP Lounge Joan Oliver is a disaster ! Food is disgusting, tables are not cleaned up. The worst I have ever seen."
3774,5959,"Not large, not small. Valencia airport has a terminal building with good view on the airside. The public zone and the safe zone are themselves quite narrow. After no English speaking officer on security check you are unwillingly thrown into duty-free shop. :D If you need to wait longer time for your next flight, there are some very comfortable soft lounges (between terminal 1 and 2 I think) For WiFi connection you have to sign in and at my gate it although wasn't working properly. Food from complicated to simple burgers. Reasonable prices for beverages."
3775,5960,"You can get to airport by metro which is fast and cheap. Airport is clean, wifi is fast. Staff in food area did not understand english very well."
3776,5963,Very small but all the better for that. Speedy passage through both ways. The facilities are not extensive but what is there did us. There is no duty free free shop so don't rely on bringing any stuff back.
3777,5964,"It has a lot to offer for a tiny airport. Getting there the easiest way is a taxi or car, public transport can still be improved there. Quick check in and security, it has an excellent, clean lounge."
3778,5965,"Small regional airport, upgraded few years ago & much nicer & spacious now. Not much in food court, very expensive limited selection."
3779,5966,New and extremely practical airport. It's not far away from the city center and the bus linking the airport to the city it's really cheap. The biggest drawback I see is the limited choice of shops/cafes in the terminal. Now it's getting a lot of new routes and companies. Definitely a good place to fly from/to.
3780,5967,"Both the terminal and the parking lot were recently expanded in 2014. Very close to the urban center of Vigo, just 20 minutes by car. There are not many bus frequencies and the price for the taxi is only approximately 20 euros wherever you go in the city."
3781,5971,"It's a small airport but it still has nice architecture and clean bathrooms. It has no WiFi or duty-free shops but it does have a nice snack shop. You'll always have to walk from the gate to your plane because the airport doesn't have jet bridges. Apart from that, the runway might need a little renovation."
3782,5972,Very helpful staff
3783,5973,"The Arrival was ok, took some time but we got out, Most terminal facilities where closed WIFI was ok but only for one our (used it when going back to dubai) food and retail services are ok In the lounge, The lounge wasn't that bad, Imigration/costums took a little of time as there where a lot of pepole, Baggage claim took a long time as well as it was super hot In the Airport."
3784,5974,"Fairly small airport but has all the necessities needed. Very “weak” security check, bagage checked twice but not thoroughly! Boarding agents checked passports very thoroughly and asked the most random questions. They could work on their security check!"
3785,5975,"Small airport, but nevertheless rather much walking. Several security checks, including one getting into the airport."
3786,5976,"I quite enjoyed the airport. It wasn’t bad as people say it was! The lounge, Palm Strip, was small but it had lots of drinks and some food to have a snack one. The toilets were clean and the staff there were very friendly and helpful"
3787,5977,"Pretty small airport but it doesn't mean its bad, it just mean more queues and more crowded space but its definitely worth as SriLankan Airlines is amazing."
3788,5978,"Colombo is much better than jeddah, jeddah is crappy, It's dirty I don't think it's ok for animals, it's crowed. It's saudi arabia you lots of money, c'mon."
3789,5979,"A scenic airport in Indian sub continent. Hub for Srilankan airlines and several major airlines also use this airport as a hub during inter continent flights. Airport is not very clean, toilets are not very clean at all. Lack of discipline is there among staffs and securities. Security procedures needs to be improved and very poor in handling queues. Airport is sufficient for a transit purpose only."
3790,5980,Good Airport With medium Facilites.Wifi is Good. Have lot of Cafes and tea Shops. Check-in was good. Had good experience in Colombo Airport
3791,5982,"This is a relatively small airport as far as I could tell from the transit area but there is one feature I thought was fantastic ... DuTEA Free I have really never see so many tea shops in one place at the same time. While Ceylon tea is one of my three favourite teas, I did not buy any here."
3792,5987,"Excellent services inside VIP lounge . Really I had found a very good services at khartoum Intl. airport and Fast check-in , Wi-Fi was available , Security check was very easy and wasn't complicated .. Thanks"
3793,5992,"The VIP Terminal is fantastic, comfortable and fast. However, the international terminal was full of people, poor facilities. DON'T TAKE PHOTO AT THE AIRPORT, or they will ask you to destroy the memory card."
3794,6001,"A distant airport, some 50kms from town, PBM is functional, but not much more. However, given that there are so few flights, it is a miracle that they have any real facilities there! The biggest issue, I find, is that many flights land late, adn the immigration queues, particularly if you have to stop and pick up a tourist card, can be long; add the hour drive into the city, and arrivals can seem interminable."
3795,6002,"I understand why it is now closed and all the low-cost operations transferred to Landvetter. It had way more amenities as far as shops than what I was expecting, but just one non-Schengen gate area was not enough for the volume of flights outside the Schengen area that the airport operated."
3796,6003,"Ugly airport , but it's perfect for those who search for cheap flights and just only care about reaching the destination. If you want luxury then this isn't the best option for you. It's a good airport overall."
3797,6004,I love Säve Airport but I wished there were direct flights to Thessaloniki! because everyone traveling towards Thessaloniki has to go up to Oslo Rygge and then down to Thessaloniki!! Hope they set destination for Thessaloniki! ;)
3798,6006,Cozy and comfortable small airport just outside Göteborg.
3799,6008,Delay 4:30 hrs :-/
3800,6013,"Getting to the airport was easy, as was security check in. Went through passport check unaware that there were NO FACILITIES on the other side. Could not get a coffee once through. Would not be difficult for the airport to inform passengers of that detail. Passport check queue was deliberately slow"
3801,6014,"Cosy small airport with good connections to the city centre. Was happy to use it on a recent trip. Facilities nic, toilets clean."
3802,6015,"Good airport, easy to change plan. Domestic and International within the same airport allowing easy transfers."
3803,6016,"Getting to Landvetter is easy by Airport bus or by car (cheap long term parking with plenty of capacity). Check in is quick with a lot of check in desks, and some electronic self check-in desks. But if you are allowed its recommended that you check in electronically with your mobile phone. Security has a long line, but it´s rather quick once you ""line up and wait"" so to say (Aviation folks will understand that pun :). Baack on topic, the airport is cozy and you feel like you are in heaven (you are), as you have a great view of some nice airport action like landning and departing planes etc. Overall i like this Airport really much and i´m certain that you will to."
3804,6017,"It still takes a long time to get your luggage. A bit too bad about customs, 2 planes at the same time and only 4 customs officers on site."
3805,6019,The luggage is always slow to arrive. Wifi is limited to 100MB so forget catching up on your favourite show while on the move. The Menzies lounge is pretty small and basic but comfortable. Otherwise there are some good options for shopping and dining in the terminal. Make sure you eat before you go through passport control as there is literally nothing on the other side.
3806,6020,The only thing that is negative about Landvetter these days is when you have to go through passport control in the departure hall as for England this old part is incredibly worn and boring.
3807,6021,"For the first time ever, he didn't see me go from the plane to the luggage belt before the bag arrived. Absolutely incredible, thanks for that SAS"
3808,6023,"If you arrive to Jonkoping in the evening you should take care of how you'll get to the city. Last bus leaves at 5 PM, so there is only one way to get to the city - very expensive taxi!"
3809,6024,"Smal Airport, but very persional. Easy to fly from and fly too. Near Town, could be better bus line to city."
3810,6025,"Tiny airport , not many flights but you get a great service! Didn't have any issues with anything. I got of the plane , went inside, my bags arrived after 2 minutes and I got out. Very simple airport from where u can travel to Stockholm several times per day and Frankfurt. Haven't experienced any of the charter flights!"
3811,6029,"The airport is just a bit too small to serve the A320 sized planes: - check in is fine as long as long as not too many skiers arrive for the same flight, which happens on the winter - there is not enough space in the departure hall - the arrival hall is too small - generally the building and the facilities could use a renovation"
3812,6030,Small airport. Airport bus with arrival/departure times adjusted to flights. Check-in: automat. Superficial security inspection.
3813,6032,Visited this small airport in late summer to let my 8 yrs old son fly for the first time in his life. We were there just for some houres between connecting flights. Having this kinda special situation in mind I´m not that pleased with the airport. No food services before you pass security and it is not opened until some time before the departures of flights. The security wasn´t friendly considering a 8 yrs old might wan´t to know if his bear shows up on the luggage scanner. So I´m happy we don´t have to use Kiruna ever again.
3814,6033,"Very small, but very friendly, faster than you can believe. very friendly staff! one small shop. Perfect small airport! Everything what you need is there! Rental-Cars are directly in front of the door."
3815,6034,Beautiful small airport. Boarding announcement that we should go to the aircraft that is right was simply hilarious.
3816,6035,"no jetway, get to walk to the aircraft itself. Nice and clean. Fast and easy security."
3817,6036,"Small and functional airport, nice option to fly abroad in central Sweden. Only KLM operates there but you can connect to all over the world."
3818,6037,"Linköping city airport is a very small airport with only 3 daily flights to Amsterdam. Getting to the airport wasn't the easiest part since there aren't buses running early in the morning to the airport. Fortunately, the airport isn't far away from downtown, approximately 30 minutes. The check-in was very fast and efficient. Certainly because it was a flight of 80 pax, thus there wasn't ""rush"" at the airport. The security check is located in a very small room. Even with this little of passengers, I, personally, flet compressed. Then, the waiting area was very clean, pleasant, with a ""fika"" zone for free, as well as good seats."
3819,6038,Nice and simple airport with just about 5 minutes to downtown. Feeder for SAS / KLM and it works great.
3820,6039,A small cosy airpot. If you have a Gold card within *A or SkyTeam you have access to a small lounge. Really friendly and a perfect feeder airport.
3821,6043,"Security check requires putting the liquids in ""their"" plastic bag (you cannot use your plastic bag, taken on another airport)."
3822,6044,"Nice small airport with short distances but very confusing with the gate numbers, they are like jumping numbers."
3823,6045,Small airport with short distances but the interesting part here is how there can be so many gates but I guess far from all are often used. Baggage claim was really quick which is great!!!
3824,6046,"This airport has a lot of gates although not being so large when it comes to passenger numbers, how come it is like this? I found the signage a bit odd and illogical at times regarding gate numbers but apart from that a convenient airport in the beautiful Skåne landscape (during summer!)"
3825,6047,"Decent airport, not much to do, but atill rhwir facilities are good. Not too crowded, depending on the month though."
3826,6049,"Quick and easy... Great rent a car parking, easy to get and go. Clean with a lot of info tables. Good connecton to the Malmo."
3827,6050,"LOUNGE ROOM REALLY DO NOT EXIST IT IS ALWAYS CLOSED, EVEN IN WORKING HOURS. I GET POISONED BY THE SOUSAGE AT THE BAR. AIRPORT IS IN THE MIDDLE OF NOTHING. GATES ARE VERY CONVINIENT AND IT IS VERY EASY TO FIND THE RIGHT GATE. AIRPORT IS VERY SMALL SO IS EASY NOT TO GET LOST. IT IS CLEAN. YOU CAN NOT BUY ALCOHOL IF YOU ARE FLYING IN EU WHAT IS RADICULUS"
3828,6051,"As I wrote in other review , I don't care about facilities I just want to travel as cheap as possible. This time I was travveling to my homecountry Romania. Everything was great.We have travelled from this airport lots of times."
3829,6052,A lovely small airport with no queues at all.
3830,6056,i was really surprised after getting my bags from the belt no one to check me and all of a sudden i was out on street NO SECURITY !
3831,6057,"Small airport with 2 gates. Nice and simple. Fast security check and baggage claim. Free WiFi limited to 500 MB and with logging in. Getting to airport is simple, they have arranged busses to go and come from the city according to plane schedule."
3832,6058,"A really nice smaller airport, good view plenty of electrical outlets to sit and work."
3833,6059,"Jepp, I worked there before and we have extreme weathers...for that extreem guys are needed :-)"
3834,6060,Amazing to see an airport operating under such snowy conditions.
3835,6063,The new market area is open and is much larger than before. Beyond that it is always great to be in the newer parts of the airport.
3836,6064,"Fast check in, easy security (terminal 5, 4 has not been upgraded yet), good food availability and toilets. Free dropoff and cheap 2 hour dropoff/pickup parking."
3837,6065,There is a new security control which has been enhanced and is now close to the newer parts of Arlanda which is the F pier.
3838,6067,"I actually got my bags so Quick that I’m giving the rating a 4, usually it takes a long time in this airport."
3839,6069,"Walking distance somewhat long to baggage claim, but reasonable when arriving. Passport check rather quick and efficient."
3840,6070,"As long as you get close to the F-Pier (SAS check-in area), traveller experience becomes enhanced and especially when they have a new security control that don’t require you to take out bottles from the bag. Wow, now Arlanda is getting closer to the big international airports out there in terms of customer experience."
3841,6071,Too much works in progress. Too many bars closed. Too long walking distance from the new security checks to the gates. Hope it will get better in winter23/24.
3842,6072,Small airport with minimal conveniences. Very convenient access to mass transit. The airport needs more support staff to assure timely departure. Security screening was well-staffed and rapid. Be prepared for delays to departure on non-domestic flights.
3843,6073,Extremely convenient airport! No jet ways. Slight delay with checked baggage. Walking distance to Tvärbanan.
3844,6074,Bromma truly is Stockholm's hidden gem—although it does get very limited international service. I loved how quick the arrival experience was and the ease of getting into the city center by tram. I would go out of my way to use Bromma whenever visiting Stockholm.
3845,6075,"Very nice airport close to downtown. Getting to is very easy. Despite outward poverty, there are all necessaries for travellers inside. I liked."
3846,6076,"The airport can be really crowded, especially during peak hours. It's not surprising, however, as it is BRA's hub."
3847,6077,"This was my first time using Stockholm Bromma, it's mainly for domestic flights within Sweden. They only have one or two international flights, one of them which are daily. That's the one I'm catching, the British Airways flight operated by Sun air of Scandinavia to Aarhus. The lounge was okay for being a regional travel lounge. I couldn't find any WiFi, so I give that one star. They had one store, which didn't have that much stuff in it. Check-In took a bit of time, due to no staff were there for my flight. During the security check the staff didn't know which airport ""AAR"" was, so they had to check that up, which took a minute. The line was about 5 minutes long, but whilst I was sitting in the lounge it was a lot longer."
3848,6078,"Very small terminal, but easy and fast to exit from. Good bus service to the city center (20 minutes) and also to Arlanda, the main airport of Stockholm. An observation terrace 200 m to the right when exiting the terminal, with a good view on the runway and the GA apron."
3849,6079,"The airport does not have a decent WiFi connectivity. Especially because a lot of flights were delayed due to strike I was depending a lot on WiFi to connect to Brussels Airlines via Skype. Also, make sure that you get something to eat before going through the terminal. Prices inside of the terminal are 1,5 / 2 times higher than outside with the same vendor (Pressbyrån)"
3850,6081,"Very small airport, with a surprisingly short check-in time. This airport lies just west of downtown Stockholm, and far less travel time than the main airport, Arlanda. The bus ride takes about 30 min, which is about half the time it takes by bus to get to Arlanda, which again depends on traffic to and from the airport. Since the airport is so small, the facilities isn't all that great. Just past the security, there is a kiosk and that is about it. The airport is quite small and somewhat old. But for short commuter flights, where the time from when you check-in til you board the airplane is quite short, it does it's job quite well."
3851,6082,"the airport is good, but the problem is that there are ~4 flights everyday, so if your flight is the first flght of the day, and for example it departs on 13:00, the airport opens at 11:00. the airport is about 90km from stockholm, there wasnt any problem with the check in, security check was also very good."
3852,6083,Getting to airport: if you take the Flygbussarna from Stockholm City (next to the main rail station) aim for Door No. 5 from where the bus to Skavsta normally leaves. (do check the screens though as it could change). Make sure to go early as it is first come first serve and for an 11:40 departure you can see people queuing up at 11 am already. Once we filled the bus at 11:20 and took off 20 minutes ahead of schedule.
3853,6084,"Small but efficient airport. Getting there - it is 120km or so away from Stockholm and takes about 80 minutes by bus. Buses are scheduled to coincide with flights. Free wifi for 30 minutes, anything beyond has to be paid. One restaurant before security, one airside which occupies half the departures area, so quite popular. Prices high-ish about 19 Euros (190 Kr for a cheeseburger). One small duty free store after security. There is a very small lounge which has coffee making facilities, anything else needs to be ordered from the bar. Immigration efficient with three posts staffed each time I have had to pass through."
3854,6085,Wifi available free 30 minutes. Very nice little airport. Getting there is easy and inexpensive but does take an hour and a half to Stockholm. Security check OK had it not been for seemingly every employee at the airport wanting to get checked at the same time as us - and of course given priority. Very tasty food in the airside restaurant. Not cheap but good food.
3855,6086,very small airport. You deplane via stairs and walk outside into terminal. Clearing immigration quite efficient as three officers available for a planeload.
3856,6087,"I don't know why it is ""Stockholm"" airport. You need to remember that to get there by bus it takes 80 min and costs around 15 euro one way. So, we paid 60 euro for me and my wife, almost like for tickets from Skavsta to Malta =) In comparison to other airports you can get by public transport for 3 euro. Off course if you want to reduce costs and ready to some inconvenience to change."
3857,6088,"Skavsta is quite small airport, so you cannot expect much here. One bar, one restaurant and a small shop Pressbyran. Duty-free area has also one shop and one bar/restaurant. But you can easily get here from Stockholm by using Flygbussarna busses."
3858,6089,"Gets the job done, tiny & boring airport with little to do. Located relatively far away, without car it might cost you more to get to Stockholm than the cost of your flight."
3859,6090,Nice airport although really far from Stockholm. It seems only to be used by low cost companies but even though have nice seating space to offer.
3860,6092,Very good airport for frequent flyers. Small and convenient. There is one gate so you cant miss it.
3861,6093,Nice
3862,6095,"I didn't expect to meet so beautiful airport in the wilderness like that. It's very cosy, even homey, airport. There is only one disadvantage - far from nearest city but there isn't any public transport, only taxi."
3863,6096,"They have not so many services as it's a small Airport in the northen Sweden but they have atleast a wifi, one café and a resturant in the check-in area and a small store thats opens when charter operated inside the terminal. The check-in server are very fast as it isnt crowded at all."
3864,6097,It's such a small airport so it has only the basic things. But it is a good airport if you live in the north and don't want to drive to ESSA (ARN). The airport did not have any WiFi because it's so small. The security was also not so good. They did not have any food and the loung was just normal. The check in went fast as it's not a big airport and not a lot of people go in there.
3865,6100,"Flexible and efficient getting to and from the airport, with good offerings with regards to food and retail services. Wifi is excellent."
3866,6102,"An ok litte airport close to Umeå with only a handful of gates. Check-in is pretty straight forward as there are quite few people. Security is quite slow and old fashion, but as there are not a lot of people, it works ok, and you get through it quite fast. There is only one food service, but it works nicely. There are no lounges. There is a single baggage claim point, where the belt for some strange reason runs counter clockwise and you spend 30 seconds watching your bag start by going away from you. Makes no sense.. :) But the baggage comes fast, as the plane is parked only about 10 meters away from the belt :)"
3867,6103,"A small but honestly pretty nice airport, I have never experienced a dely on the airports side here."
3868,6104,"Small airport, but very efficient. Especially whilst flying domestically. The WiFi is not the best, but getting to the airport is easy, and the check-in is very smooth thanks to self check-ins."
3869,6109,"Very nice and clean airport arriving in the new terminal. Getting to the airport is easy, the terminal facilities are very good, WIFI is free, Food is very nice there is the Marhaba lounge witch I used costumes are quick because I have an European passport and baggage claim took a little bit of time but was ok."
3870,6111,Efficient transfer from the remote stand to the arrival gate. Passport control was seamless. Baggage received 20 minutes after landing.
3871,6113,"Arrive early! Swiss has very few ticket counters and the instructions for the bag drop are not clear, which resulted in confusion and congestion in the line. The security lanes are not well-organized, making the process slow as well. Once past security, the terminal is old and cramped, but there are plentiful food options."
3872,6118,"For me Geneva Airport is one of the best airports in the world for many reasons, first of all the airport is really close to the city, the airport is in a really good shape and well organized, even if there might be some big queues at the security ( you can buy a priority pass for only CHF 10 wich is not that bad for cutting the whole queue). Geneva Airport serves a pretty massive number of short haul and long haul destinations. Such as China,Mauritius,Etiophia and also a lot of north american operations."
3873,6124,"Very clean Airport, love to be in it, getting there costed a lot with my uber, First class check-in was closed witch was very disapointing, as well as I had to go to the buisness class check in. The first class security check was closed, But the Normal one was quick enought, Terminal facilities where ok. WIFI was good. DIid nt try the food services exept for the lounge. The first class ounge was closed so I had to go to the buisness class lounge+ the showers where closed but thankfully there was An area reserved for first class."
3874,6125,"Very welcoming airport, the check in is easy, security check is ok, terminal facilities are very good, I haven't tried WIFI in the airport. Food and retail where good in the lounge. The lounge was very nice and quiet."
3875,6126,"I found the variety of eateries landside very lacking for such a major hub. I expected something more akin to Heathrow in variety, but was disappointed. Security was woefully understaffed too."
3876,6128,"Very nice and clean airport but with a few downsides that don't make it ideal for long stopovers; the WiFi is free only for four hours, after which you need to pay; food and drink options are very expensive, even for basic needs."
3877,6132,"good design train connections unrivaled long walk from train station to check in Security was ok for airport of that size and easy to get in(scan boarding pass) Didn't go to lounge or eat food Wifi good enough Inter-Airport Train is decently chaotic Immigration is huge pain, wanted to stay in country on way back home for few hours, immigration. Thats ok, but then coming back had to do immigration 3 TIMES!"
3878,6133,Clean and good. Isn't too much overcrowded. I was here for only like 2 hours. I was there only for boarding another plane
3879,6137,"Small and cozy airport with everything!! There are free water fountains, very clean environment and friendly staffs. I enjoyed my time in this airport."
3880,6138,"Smaller and older than expected, which in fact gave me the nice 80s Asian airport feeling. It still had everything necessary, SIM card counter (really cheap SIMs!), cash ATM and Starbucks. The staff was nice to guide us for a good photo spot. They led us to the connection bridge between dom and int terminal, it also served as sitting area and display for airlines serving the airport. Access to city was real easy by metro, all the main areas on 1 line."
3881,6139,"Simple clean airline with a good lounge with wonderful congee, Haagan Daz ice cream, etc. Very nice people working at security as well."
3882,6140,"Easy to get in and out! WiFi is really convenient,the terminal is really clean.Airport staffs and immigration officers are really polite,the security check is smooth and fast. Hope more airlines could launch services to here!"
3883,6141,Immigration counters couldn't seem to cope with the flood of passengers from widebodies. No proper queue system and too time-consuming.
3884,6142,"Excellent airport. Clean, easy to get in/out, free wifi, perfect service. In my personal TOP 3 airports."
3885,6144,"Artistic terminal designs, speedy immigration process, convenient surface access, FIVE STARS!!"
3886,6145,"Fast, friendly and efficient..."
3887,6146,Only 15mins from landing to the taxi cab
3888,6149,Small airport at an small island.
3889,6154,"A tiny civilian-military airport with 2 gates and some stores. The VIP lounge is in the corner of the airport which might be hard to find. The Wi-Fi is really good- In the lounge, at least. There shouldn't be delays since there's only a few flights a day."
3890,6157,It's a nice domestic airport that also offers international flights. The viewing deck on the top floor is great!
3891,6158,"Great airport, very easy to fly from. Short ways and very helpful staff of Uni Air. Domestic terminal not too crowded. Also, free WiFi is stable and fast. Recommend it!"
3892,6159,"TSA has a self-service counter, which is convenient and fast. There are electronic luggage lockers for convenience, taxis are easy to find, and there are many convenient large luggage towing facilities at MRT stations that are clearly marked. There are many supermarkets in the airport lobby, which are convenient for temporary purchase of daily necessities."
3893,6160,"Easy to get in and out! Clean,Convenient,Comfort! The observation deck is awesome,so many visitors love there too,the immigration officers are friendly."
3894,6161,One of the best airport in Taiwan. Not that big but cosy. Located close to the city center and can be reached by MRT. Clean and bright airport with several convenient stores where for the reasonable price you can get decent snacks.
3895,6162,"Convenient to get to by public transport with the city metro. Has decent options in the public area. Observatory was awesome for airplane spotting. Some glass windows were tinted though. Shop selling aviation-related merchandise is an attraction for avgeeks, though a lot of publications are in Chinese so that's a bummer."
3896,6163,Nice VIP lounge. Not big but really nice.
3897,6164,super duper close to city center. it just take a 20 minute from Ximending. old but renovated recently.
3898,6165,little but lovely and convenient. free wifi provided by the airport and 7-11.
3899,6166,"Newly renovated, getting better and better"
3900,6167,"Slow security and customs, but everything else makes up for it. It is an expansive airport, very good."
3901,6168,"Getting to the airport is extremely easy with the Taoyuan airport MRT system. Check in lines were very short, however, the desk agents did take a while to check me in due to some unique circumstances on my end. Security check is fast and easy, the terminal is well designed, clean, and have plenty of duty free and food service points. The EVA Lounge has a good assortment of food and beverages, but there is a lack of natural lighting, as the only windows are into the checkin area."
3902,6169,Very good airport has multiple lounges had water bottle fill up stations AND THE GATE WAS HELLO KITTY THEMED! :)
3903,6171,Hard to park and expensive. Fully manual check-in making line long and slow. Limited food and retail services in morning
3904,6172,Taoyuan International airport is clean. The people are friendly! Can't wait to see your new terminal!!
3905,6173,"The opening hours of the self-service baggage check-in are unreasonable, the ground staff does not respect the passengers' choices, and the self-service customs clearance personnel do not respect the choice of whether to take fingerprints, but it is very quick in the morning."
3906,6174,"At first glance,Taipei Taoyuan Airport is quite small but when inside,first glance again,kind of old and the money transfer to Taiwan Money is small as."
3907,6175,"Only issue at TPE is with the shops (and especially the restaurants!) closing pretty early (7-8pm), so if you have an evening flight and you crave dinner, you won't have much choice"
3908,6176,"I went to the Taoyuan Terminal 1 VIP Lounge. There was a little lack of stuff. It opened at 5:30 in the morning, and I was still the first customer."
3909,6181,"The airport was undergoing maintenance to its terminal. Because of this, all flights were in 1 general open air waiting area which was practically on the apron allowing for great plane spotting of the regional & charter planes. Cessna 208s, ATRs, DHC-6."
3910,6182,"Small city. Mostly for Safaris. 1 Supermarket, rough roads. Peaceful once out if town. No need to return."
3911,6184,"Terminal 3 is very pleasant and more than big enough for the traffic it needs to handle. Few services, but everything was clean and very well designed. Exceptionally smooth experience for Africa"
3912,6185,Stopover in DAR. Smooth flight. Easy boarding. Short walk to terminal. Good views over water and land. Some clouds.
3913,6186,"As of Nov 2019,Terminal 3 is a new building for international flights, but has basic facilities. Terminal 2 is for Air Tanzania. Terminal 1 is the oldest, with rudimentary facilities and mainly for small and charter flights to domestic destinations. You can walk between the terminals, but will need to step outside of the buildings."
3914,6190,"Expect long queue at the immigration desk! We didn't even get a proper visa, just a stamp in our passports with some handwriting (very unusual). The whole process took approximately 1 hour, mostly caused by unnecessary micromanagement by the immigration personnel - we had to stand in 3 different lines... Good news, that the card payment works fine, the old cash-payment (USD only) is not the only way to pay for the entry visa. Take a good look at the baggage claim! Even if we were promised by Emirates (the arranged our whole flight) to transfer our baggage, the airport personnel didn't do it. We found our luggage lying on the floor. It had to be collected by us and checked in again to the connecting flight. They did this on the way back too. The ""connecting flight corridor"" is a joke. You and your hand luggage are going to be security scanned again anyway. If you have a long connection, I suggest going out of the airport and eating in front of the building, in the McDonald's-like restaurant instead of in the one on the first floor of the airport building. If you happen to travel to Zanzibar like we did, consider buying gifts in front of this airport. The prices are in some cases a lot lower than in Zanzibar (e.g. Tanzania soccer t-shirt fort TZS 2.000,- instead of 35.000,-)."
3915,6191,"If you are a skyteam member, I forget which level but you can get access to the free lounge downstairs. There's free private wifi, good food and drinks, and comfortable lounge chairs. Highly recommended"
3916,6195,At first the Kilimanjaro airport seemed like a decent airport for its small size. It was really easy to get out of and was clean and modern...
3917,6196,"Small but nice airport. I got there by a private car without problem, security check for entering the airport was fast. On the other hand only one check-in counter opened made the waiting long. Many stores where you can buy anything, but only one restaurant with high prices. Once entered gate area, no signs or boards, so I was clueless about my delayed flight and nobody was able to inform me. Also only one small buffet at the gate with poor choice of food. Air condition worked perfectly while waiting."
3918,6197,Cute tiny airport.
3919,6198,No stores after security.
3920,6203,"Brand new international terminal. Confusing as to where to find others in domestic terminal. Agent helped guide us to our driver and host, Sulieman"
3921,6209,"International terminal was nice, everything was fast including baggage claim. No immigration since I got my visa already. Domestic terminal is a small house, with almost no choice of food or drinks. I shortened my waiting time watching local TV. Organization was surprisingly good and smooth. Little hard to locate the terminal, but once inside it has warm atmosphere."
3922,6213,"I took the free passenger shuttle bus from BKK. I had plenty of time between flights, so it was stress free. Check-in took some time, but that was not an issue with the airport. There is a large selection of places to eat landside, less so airside, but I've come to expect that in Asia. Security took just 5 minutes. The WiFi kept dropping out, requiring a log login procedure each time."
3923,6214,Long imigration queue and what else to say here idk but the airport looks good even though is old i guess
3924,6215,this airport is not that good but not bad this airport need some renovation i liked it but tbh it is nice
3925,6216,"The airport isn't that bad, it looks old and dark, it doesn't feel fun (?) kkk like it's not cheerful"
3926,6217,"The experience at Don Mueang was great. There was very little traffic, check in, self and manual was a breeze, security was a fast and easy process, and facilities were great. Bathrooms were better than Suvarnabhumi despite Don Mueang being older. Food and Retail was great, and there was many options. The oldest airport in Asia did not look old at all!"
3927,6218,"The airport is so big. Taking the bus from Mumbai to the station took a long time. After entering immigration, I immediately saw my luggage"
3928,6219,"Good makeover since 2005 (last time I flew there). Lots of space, food outlets are better than usual, boarding processes are efficient. The transit experience could be improved, since there is no people mover (only walkalators) from one end of Terminal 1 (International) to Terminal 2 (domestic). However it is still a pleasant experience, and not as crowded as BKK (depending on the time of day)."
3929,6220,"It was surprised the Nok Air Lounge had already opened for premium passengers. It came a free coffee, and food before boarding the plane."
3930,6221,Just perfect.ITS LIKE A DREAM I LOVE IT JUST PERFECT OMG- GETTING TO THE AIRPORT IS JUST THE BEST THINGS IN EARTH-
3931,6222,"Thailand's 'old' International Airport. Efficient and friendly staff, clearly marked signs and plenty of places for a bite to eat."
3932,6223,Hot and too big without any rail links connect gates to the security. Long queues. Not much food to eat. Railway concourse too small. Too many people. No wifi?
3933,6224,"BKK is like a TARDIS. The walk from the gate to immigration is long than the terminal seems from the outside, but was made longer as passengers were directed past the first area to a second area further down the concourse. After a while, not being able to see the sign for the next immigration area, I asked a staff member. She asked how many were in my party. I was alone and she directed me in to the crew immigration area. There was no queue and I was able to walk straight to the nearest immigration desk and was landside 35 minutes after the recorded arrival time."
3934,6225,"Having parked on the apron, we were bused to the arrival gate. This seemed to be a lot further journey than I can imagine that it should be. However, it meant that I arrived at the baggage carousel just as my case arrived. I had pre-booked a taxi and was hoping to see my name being held up on a board. That wasn't the case and I had to wait about 15 to 20 minutes before the driver was available. Always count on traffic in the centre of Bangkok which increases the journey time."
3935,6226,"Only 7 minutes for security and 8 for immigration. I opted for the eGates rather than the manned booths. I realised that I was the only westerner in the queue and thought that maybe it was only for certain nationalities, but it was fine. Most of the facilities and food are landside. Airside tends to be mostly duty free shops. I couldn't see anywhere to have sit down food. There are water refill stations. The WiFi is a real pain. It requires a long process to gain access. It would not be a problem if this had to be done only once, but the connection kept on dropping, which required repeating the process. This was not a time limit thing as the times between drops varied greatly."
3936,6227,"There is an international hospital booth at the arrival hall, and the shuttle is free haha. If you take it, you can get to Ploenchit in one go. Good tip."
3937,6228,Only transferred through however it is a huge airport so make sure you give yourself time to get through took us about 30 minutes to walk to our gate and about another hour to get through the passport check.
3938,6229,"Enormous airport. Facilities are top notch, very good 0-24 lounges, good restaurants and shops. It is a nightmare to get to the airport or go to the city, but good once you are there. However, the immigration is the worst, so slow, they take picture, finger prints both when you go in and out of the country. You can easily stand there for hours…"
3939,6230,i went to the airport and honestly the airport is clean unlike other airport in bk u should visit it
3940,6231,"The huge airport has long distances to walk, noisy. Signage to transfer desks is horrible, with arrows pointing in all directions, even in 2 opposite directions for the same transfer desk. Tight security, even in transit areas between 2 international flights (that's good, of course)."
3941,6232,The toilets are poorly maintained. The transit to another flight is chaotic. The boards are not informative for the most part.
3942,6233,"This really is small, provincial airport but it has been upgraded and that work continues. I saw a plan of what the airport will look like when all work has been completed and it looks rather nice!"
3943,6234,"This is a tiny airport and it handles very few flights a day. However, it is being upgraded to take it up to 12 flights a day. It is clean and tidy and modern. The airport is way out of the city so it is quiet and it is easy to get to: no traffic snarl ups here!"
3944,6237,"The domestic terminal is very small and overcrowded with too many people. Service is just so-so, you can find everything, but limited."
3945,6238,"Small airport, easy to get around, quick to go through security, immigration, and baggage claim = super convenient"
3946,6239,"Need to pass through 2-step security check. First, at the terminal entrance. Second, at the entrance to airside. Also very slow baggage handling."
3947,6240,"Do not exchange money at the airport! Exchange rate is terrible. Otherwise OK, baggage claim fast, no other issue."
3948,6242,"Security check happens even BEFORE entering the airport and check-in counters, so get there on time and don't be late to not be stressed about missing checking in bags. Airport is not big, it's not hard to find a way. There aren't too many shops, obviously."
3949,6243,"Caution: Even when flying in from BKK, if your luggage got checked through from an international flight, then go to international baggage claim"
3950,6244,There's a lot of hotel near the airport. Because we're early flight. So we choose the hotel near airport.
3951,6245,"Good wifi as with most Thai airports! Nice and easy to get to from Chiang Mai being located only about 3/4 kilometers from the old town. Check-in and security were fast and efficient, however the terminal itself past security has barely any shops/restaurants."
3952,6246,Traveling from the city to the airport is convenient. There are cool air conditioned buses. Sent to terminiob
3953,6247,"nice airport. good service and has restaurant and other shops such as dairy queen, black canyon and thai airways restaurant. easy to find boarding gate to the aircraft. It's green airport. Nice weather and has many facility for passenger."
3954,6248,"There has Dairy Queen outlet as well as a Black Canyon Coffee along with several other shops, with both the international and domestic arrivals and departures handled on the same floor but in separate areas."
3955,6249,Calm & Nice Airport
3956,6250,"Took a domestic flight with Bangkok Air from Phuket to Hat Yai, ground staff was quickly done with their tasks, so we could start deplaning. Once in the bagage drop-off area, our baggage took only a few minutes to arrive on belt. Excellent service, though signs could be more specific and frequent."
3957,6251,here is better the airport in south of thailand. so......i hope to come here one more time. aassadsadsfjdskiajfvakdfvnkadmvkadvkdfav;mkamvkdsmvkdfvk;avdkfmvkdajv;kdavmkdamvfkmkvmdfk;avikervidkafvkfdvmfdlsv;mjfdknbvjebuhepqbiuverhgfuirevhebvvnejqivcr
3958,6252,small...easy to navigate
3959,6255,"Airport has been extensively expanded and looks great! Such an easy airport for curb side drop off/pick up. No hassles from security so long as you don’t park beyond reasonable! The new terminal is spacious and check in is easy. Security lines are never busy and the departure lounge is huge with plenty of coffee shops/snack kiosks. Air Asia from DMK and Thai Smile from BKK serve Khon Kaen most frequently (my personal preference is Thai Smile - fabulous cabin crew, young but well trained and very efficient."
3960,6256,"You can getting to the Airport by Taxi with charge about 120 Baths or Personal Car, but The parking area is small. anyway The WIFI is Free. The Airport has 12-13 flights per day. The cafeteria is on the 3rd floor and Coffee Shop on the 2nd floor."
3961,6257,"For passengers arriving at KKC, there are many car rental places like AVIS on the first floor of the airport. Taxis are also available, however. The airport is quite small, with only 1 jet bridge. The airport cafeteria is on the top floor, which I believe is the 3rd. The baggage claim is very fast because, like mentioned before, the airport is quite small so the bags are transferred quickly from the plane to the baggage claim."
3962,6259,"My all time favourite airport. Fully outdoor, you can watch the planes take off and land from swing or benches up close while drinking a cocktail. So cute and friendly. Really an experience on its own!"
3963,6260,"Very unique airport. Only ""disadvantage"", but part of the unique concept: No air-condition, because everything is ""open air""."
3964,6261,"This is an airport everyone should experience. If you want to do that to the max, check your bags in early - there can be long queues. Everything else is seemless and you are in the middle of a jungle airport."
3965,6262,"Awesome, awesome airport. Lounge access for all customers on Bangkok Airways. I love the walk from the check-in area to the gates. It feels more like a fancy, tropical shopping mall than an airport!"
3966,6263,Features beautiful scenery as the arrival and departure hall is outdoor while shops and lounges are indoor.
3967,6264,"One of my favourite airports I've been to, cause it's outside. And it was really cool to hear all of the planes landing and taking of from the airport."
3968,6265,"Amazing! One of the best airports I've ever been to. Especially when you fly Bangkok Airways. Great airport service from the owner of the airport.wonderful little airport. When flying with Bangkok Airways, one feels as if in business class.i love to go to samui. every summer i must go their.i love samuiiiiiiiiiii"
3969,6266,"Good airport, small wooden one, they are made of wood, very cozy, similar to the one in Sukothai. Everything turns out perfect, getting there is easy, I think it's perfect for where it is. If you arrive in the rainy season, don't be surprised by what you see. They take very good care of everything. Small and cozy shops are not the ones at every airport. You have coffee, juice, etc... in the public waiting room"
3970,6267,No pre-boarding of the aircraft for Business passengers. After entering the open bus to the aircraft we have to wait sitting in hot sunshine for about 15 minutes. After that we nd to cue for coming onboard behind the economy passengers. Very old Boeing 737-400 with old Business Class.
3971,6269,Krabi Airport is a regional airport and does not have many facilities or shops in the terminal. There are some convenience stores and duty free shops but it very much serves its' basic purpose as an airport. Facilities there are basic and boarding are all by bus gates.
3972,6270,"Small, but compact and thus comfortable airport. Everything is close at hand, car rentals are 2 minutes from the exit, there is a covered corridor between the 2 terminals. The only negative is the lack of adequate signage for certain things - for example if you fly domestic with Thai Airways, you have to check in in the international terminal first :-)"
3973,6272,"Regional airport just to move from A to B. Airport is reachable by bus, however must be booked in advance and from airport to city is done by bus, which leaves when they are full. Security is fair. Not the fastest nor the slowest. check-in was chaotic."
3974,6273,"far too small for the number of passengers, very limited retail/food and nothing like enough seats once passed security. In addition in T2 there are no departure screens so you need to listen out for shouts from the airline crew"
3975,6284,"In the end, its alright i guess but make sure to not get scammed when buying taxis and transport, make sure to get a charter from your hotel or apartment if you can if not then get a GRAB which is like uber"
3976,6285,"First domestic terminal, then international. Damn security checks.. How fussy they are. Lounge was great. We were the only ones!!!"
3977,6286,"Next to Mai Khao beach, the airport is located north of tourist areas such as Surin, Kamala, and Patong. The 45 minute drive took us from the airport to our resort in Kamala. Korean air had enough priority lanes and made our experience very quick. There were dozens of souvenir shops operated by King Power that sold Thai silk products, Thai biscuits, and other Thai products. The Coral lounge that was provided was good and had some cold and hot food choices as well as beverages. The wifi wasn't working properly tho."
3978,6287,HKT is a very good airport but lacks some stuff Crowd control for baggage claim and immigration because it’s always very crowded at any given time but overall amazing airport
3979,6288,"Subway queue took a while and was ordinary, airport wasn’t too bad, check in and security was pretty quick, was hoping they had player names on the Leicester city shop"
3980,6289,Not happy with the boarding at the gates. You have to que up again for another bag check.. Just more stress that is not needed.
3981,6290,"Immigration was really fast, getting to the airport is cheap via taxi, wifi was available but didn't work at least for us."
3982,6291,Not many shops are open inside the transit area. Only Burger King/subway/small eaterie and 1 coffee and bar place were open inside.
3983,6292,"UTP is a a bit mad with passengers wandering aimlessly. There was a massive queue at immigration when I arrived. Onward transportation an experience. I'm sure it is all very well organised in the eyes of the Thais, but to foreigners it appears a complete shambles. After buying a ticket in advance passengers have no idea what to do next. Asking if a particular bus is the one that I should get on always had a negative answer. Then some random guy would come alone and point to the bus I was to get on. They do drop passengers right at their accommodation, or as close to it as possible, which is good. I'm not sure if flying to UTP actually saved any time compared to flying to BKK or DMK when travelling to Pattaya."
3984,6293,A short bus transfer to terminal Immigration was quick and baggage claim was empty Still took 15 minutes for bags to arrive
3985,6294,Hold bags were taken form the ship and would be picked up in MAN No checkin at airport just straight upstairs to departures 10-15 minutes to get through security Departure lounge was rather busy due to 4 other flights departing
3986,6295,There's no rush at passport control! We stood there for 1.5 hours!
3987,6297,"Surat Thani is a regional airport serving mainly flights to Bangkok. It offers a few shops, free wifi and is easy reachable by bus, taxi or Minivan. The shops within the terminal is not much as most of them are coffee shops, but expect little waiting times at checkin, security and boarding."
3988,6298,Excellent option in case you want a cheaper flight to Samui. Efficient with baggage claim and plenty of connections by bus.
3989,6301,"Avoid the airport if possible, not nice if you have to wait there for several hours."
3990,6302,"small and unstructured. There is no information on the internet about moving to and from the airport. Upon arrival you are taken to an external booth where they sort tourists according to destination, dividing them between: those who have to take the public bus, a collective minivan or taxi. All without specific arrival time, distance, or choice. If you decide not to use this service you are completely isolated from everything."
3991,6303,It is small airport you will not easy to use this airport no have motorbike taxi bus or other...... No WiFi it have small drinking shop or coffee shop but now in renovating it will good soon you can use 2 airlines it have thai AirAsia and nokair fly from bangkok DMK to trang province
3992,6304,Cosy.
3993,6305,"Although the airport is regional, it is very eco-friendly. The airport is very natural, with gardens next to the airport. The terminal itself is a big hut, and outdoor without air con. However, the weather there is mostly nice."
3994,6306,"Although the airport is regional, it is very eco-friendly. The airport is very natural, with gardens next to the airport. The terminal itself is a big hut, and outdoor without air con. However, the weather there is mostly nice."
3995,6308,Taxi or walking are your only options here if you do not have a pick-up or car rental. Baggage claim however is always very quick and it usually doesnt take more than 5 minutes from disembarking to being out of the airport.
3996,6310,The airport is currently under construction to extend the frontage as I write this review. The airport although is called Ubon Ratchathani International it only serves flights into Bangkok two main Airport's Suvarnabhumi and Don Murang New Indonesia airline just started using it called Lion Air Thai . very good and very cheap!. The airport is about is very close to town and taxi are there all the time.
3997,6311,"Departure lounge is a little bit cramped because 2 Thai Smile flights pax was waiting for the plane to arrive, and there’s only 1 jetbridge for Terminal A"
3998,6312,very surprised airport
3999,6314,OK Local domestic airport with all that you need.
4000,6318,The WiFi was spotty and very few working outlets to recharge your devices. Not an ideal place to stopover
4001,6320,"Nice and clean airport. Quite annoyed at the fact that photography is banned though, they say its due to ""security purposes"". Nice amount of shops outside security but not many inside."
4002,6321,arrival area clean and cool.. security checks slow and officials rude and abrupt double searches of entire fights' bags and the repeat x-ray of bags on exiting the terminal....not a pleasant experience
4003,6325,Nice and small airport.
4004,6326,this airport is very good it's nice and you can find many good facilities you can get all food and retail servecies there i hope this review help you to get an idea about this airport

4006,6329,GOOD
4007,6331,"not a lot in the terminal, 1 cafe which served hot and cold food. Not enough seating in the terminal."
4008,6335,Upon arrival at departures all luggage must be put though a X-Ray machine then you may check in. Border and immigration is easy. Small duty free and anyone traveling to the UK must go though extra screening. There is free WiFi and it’s extremely clean
4009,6336,"Check in takes ages and lots of security checks, Small airport but a large duty free, has a restaurant with smoking room"
4010,6337,"No smokers lounge at the airport, not in public area, nor in duty free area after customs. The former smokers room is closed."
4011,6338,"Problems to reach the airport. Enfidha is 50km far from Sousse and in the early morning no public busses are going to Enfidha from Sousse. Its a big problem. The only possibility to go there from Sousse are hotel transfer busses (20-30 dinars) or taxi (50-60 dinars). But: No tourists, no busses."
4012,6339,The airport Enfidha is a nice modern airport and it's nicely decorated. But after the landing you have to wait a very long time at the passport check and baggage reclaim. You shouldn't behave erratically because the security guards often make baggage checks which take much time. In the whole it's a good airport.

4017,6344,Excellent airport
4018,6345,Beautiful seaside airport in Tunisia.
4019,6350,not bad airport :)
4020,6352,"I had the best experience with this airport. The service is very pleasant for my Frankfurt flight and the Duty Free meets my criteria perfectly. During my check-in, there were no problems and customs went through like a TGV."
4021,6354,"I expected more! For an airport serving the capital of the state of Tunisia, it seemed mostly like a provincial airport! They are not very modern..."
4022,6355,"Tunis airport really doesn't get better ... there are some pretty good things about it; the duty free shop is pleasant as are the other shopping options, but for those wishing to wait in peace, the airport leaves much to be desired. The check in is chaotic; security lines long and inefficient and the passport control simply lethargic. Allow plenty of time, although you won't really know what to do with it if you get through the formalities quickly. One very good facility is in the arrivals hall you can get a complimentary Orange SIM card loaded with sufficient data to get a cab or such like - additional time can be purchased easily in the city."
4023,6359,"Immigration lines can be a nightmare. If traveling through this airport frequently, prepare by picking up several departure/arrival cards and completing as much as possible. Checking in can also be a hassle and most European flight counters are in an area not well marked."
4024,6360,"Immigration lines can be a nightmare. If traveling through this airport frequently, prepare by picking up several departure/arrival cards and completing as much as possible. Checking in can also be a hassle and most European flight counters are in an area not well marked."
4025,6362,"Small Regional Airport but devided in domestic and international departures and arrivals. It’s an old airport in need of renovations but the personnel is really nice and helpful. We arrived for our flight 2 hours early, we could have arrived an hour later and it would still be on time."
4026,6365,Its too good and you can go Ziyapasa less than 30 minutes :)
4027,6367,- Airport is only accessible via car or taxi - Airport WiFi not working properly - TK Lounge in Domestic departure area not existent
4028,6368,Very big and clean. Wifi is limited. Food was expensive. Staff are good. Toilets are available at most doors. There is only bus for public transportation.
4029,6369,Not a busy airport. Do not buy the Turkish delights in the Airport Duty-Free. It was super expensive. Supermarkets within the city have the same for a much lower price. Toilets are available closer to the gates.
4030,6370,"Only good thing about lounge is the direct bus to the plane. food is low average, no alcohol, also not many other drinks"
4031,6371,Big airport with many options to eat or spend time even at night. Free Wi-Fi is available only for 2 hours per week.
4032,6372,Nice spacious airport with friendly staff. Very clean. Few food options. No smoking room after you get into transit area. The only smoking area was a balcony belonging to a cafe with parking view.
4033,6373,"Expensive terminal. Additionally, the taxi distance for takeoff from runways 21 is very long. Nice terminal. But it's so expensive. If your plane is taking a 21 R or L runway, you spend a lot of time on the taxiway."
4034,6374,"baggage claim is separated between national and international, even if you connected in another airport in Turkey (I made MXP-SAW-ESB). They used a jetbridge at arrival but have us take a bus to the international baggage claim."
4035,6375,"Very spacious, luminous, nicely designed and well-organised airport in the capital city of Turkey. It would have been much better with a direct railway connection to the city center. Flight from İstanbul takes 45 minutes, so does a bus ride to the city center from the airport :)"
4036,6376,Perfect airport. Free-looking-paid-wifi is avaible. Baggage claim is good but sometimes it can last longer than your flight. No sense security check at the first entrance. They say you have to remove your iPad or PC at both security checks. Far to city (30km) and no underground connection to centre.
4037,6379,https://kureselgazete.com.tr is a global news site where you can find the most up-to-date breaking news from the world press.
4038,6380,It is an excellent airport. This airport is absolutely crazy. It would be perfect to expand the airport further and it would be great if it had 2 more runways. Everyone comes to this airport. It is like the meeting point of the world.
4039,6382,"Very crowded airport. Check-in takes a long time, so an early arrival is absolutely necessary. But the security check goes very quickly. It's way too crowded at the gates. All seating options are occupied. Very diverse food options."
4040,6383,Typical holiday airport. Seats are always occupied because it is simply too crowded. Both terminals are simply too small for the number of passengers. Gastro is okay though. When you arrive you get your suitcases very quickly and entry goes very quickly.
4041,6385,"Not really intended for transfers, it results in somewhat chaotic processes. Nevertheless, the change worked with a gross time of 1 (one) hour between the planned landing and departure. In fact, it took me 22 minutes from door to door (plane doors). Admittedly with running and overcoming the prevailing chaos. But IT WORKED!!1! But if you want a relaxing transfer, you should plan 4-5 hours and go to the land side. Double emigration is worth a stay in a cafe (the choice is limited but I know a good one)."
4042,6386,"Antalya airport is good, but this time we waited our baggage for an hour. But still the airport is good for passengers."
4043,6387,Wifi nonexistent and I was charged €8 for a tea and ONE piece of baklava. But at least getting there is no hassle at all with the tram.
4044,6392,"First time using the new international terminal, coming into the terminal was quite chaotic and the security at the first check was quite rude, the pasport control and second security check were fine."
4045,6393,"Had to go through security twice and got the checked in luggage scanned the first time. Bodrum is very expensive with just one restaurant €20 for one slice of pizza, €17 for a small plate of chips and I overheard people saying they were disgusting. There is a lounge that is €60 per person to go into."
4046,6396,Very good airport Temperature checks on arrival great for disabled passengers to use We return here regularly
4047,6397,"In the morning, there were 3 check-in desks open (of which 1 was for business class, which also checked in economy class), the queue lasted more than an hour (because everyone was brought from the hotels at about the same time)"
4048,6399,"I am a regular traveller through bodrum International Terminal and find my visit to be trouble free and enjoyable a lot better than the old terminal which is now the domestic , wifi is not too good but plenty of food ,shopping to enjoy also the airport is glass all-round so plenty of enjoyment for children, all in all it is a nice airport with air bridges to the aircraft ."
4049,6400,"The airport is quite big, but in check-in there are lots of people. The useless double check of our hand baggage is the problem. There is also no Wi-Fi in lounge. Other things were very good. After check-in & security check it was nice. There were lots of shops etc. The comfortable jet bridge is very nice option there. I recommend this airport but I've seen much better ones."
4050,6401,"Was only here for the best part of an hour before our plane boarded, however I was pleasantly surprised by the presence of Smoking Lounges in the departures zone. It’s not clear but there’s one that’s exclusively for the use of patrons of a restaurant, however there’s a public one. Fabulous layout which reminds me greatly of RIX (Rīga Airport, LV). Almost every popular fast food chain from the UK can be found in the main atrium."
4051,6402,"Easy airport to navigate, more than enough passport checking staff. wifi offering is very poor though, especially if you’re delayed or you arrive early"
4052,6403,free wifi is only for 30 minutes and don't clear how to get access. Everething is very expansive. Seats in lounge is not comfortable.
4053,6406,"Security is good. Travelling with Pegasus, two archway scanners and random search including empty pockets, carry-on case search and pat down before boarding. Very happy with that although I'm sure some would find it an annoyance."
4054,6407,AIRPORT IS SO GOOD- CHECK IN PERSONALS IS KING FOR REAL But wifi sucks.. Foods are expensive a lot Lounge is comfy-
4055,6408,"A very huge airport. Personally, I missed duty free shops"
4056,6409,"Quick security checks and passport control. Good facilities (eat, drink, shop, toilets, seats) for such a small airport."
4057,6410,"Although the new Terminal is open, it appeared that ongoing work wasbeing carried out ie hammering & tools being used, very off putting whilst trying to hear airport announcements. Also some retail food outlets are staffed by non English speaking staff, gave up trying to purchase food,"

4059,6419,Very good and eneough for Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Brand new airport nicely done. The only issue is transportation. Its expensive and hard to get to the airport.
4060,6420,Good luck getting there if you don't get a taxi. Wifi is terrible. Airport is fine for a small one though. Lovethat you can walk on tarmac to the plane.
4061,6421,"Great Airport! It is a very nice airport with great links to Turkey only. Do not be confused when entering the airport for departures, they have a security, then check in."
4062,6422,Immigration stamps your passport on request or you have an option the stamp to be placed on a paper slip.
4063,6424,"Ercan Havalimanı, Only the airport that you can reach Turkish part of Cyprus. You can find any informations in Turkish language on this website: http://www.ercanhavalimani.com Airport has auto park, customs, duty free and other facilities."
4064,6425,it's a nice little airport in the northern part of Cyprus. About 30 mins away from the capital Nicosia. The airport recently went through some reorganization and added new cafes such as Gloria Jeans and a new shopping area. It also has a new website at www.flyercan.com for live arrivals and departures information among other things.

4066,6427,Small but nice airport. Short runway.
4067,6429,Great new terminal with innovative loop exterior/interior design. Wonderful snowy mountainous views all around the city and airport. Feast for the eyes
4068,6431,lovely and well designed
4069,6432,Funny and small
4070,6437,Very hot at the lounge. Very hot at the lounge. Very hot at the lounge. Very hot at the lounge. Very hot at the lounge.
4071,6438,"GAZ airport is extremly expensive like many other airports. A beer of 0,33 l which have a price of 18 TL does not taste good. The road between Alanya and Gazipasa is very good, however the last hundred meters to the airport is not good and must be subject to change."
4072,6440,"New airport, looks like not yet completed. Simple and small. Nothing inside, you run in double control points, one after another. Road to airport is a narrow, undivided road. Taxis available outside. Also buses transferring to Alanya."
4073,6444,"Not enough seats anywhere to sit down, passangers need to wait standng or ploding around. Only 1 hour WiFi is available via kiosk registration."
4074,6445,"everything about this airport is cool, and it's huge, we got lost in it for 10 mins also i just like the atmosphere"
4075,6450,"I had super short connection flight and with that extra passport control, security checkpoint for transit passengers were wonderful."
4076,6451,"Istanbul International Airport is a very modern and large airport. It is a great airport, with food courts and everything you may need."
4077,6452,"too long distance between gates, and lack of English communication sometimes make it difficult to understand at counters or in shops"
4078,6453,I’ve actually loved the Ataturk Airport. It feels like you are waking in a busy shopping mall. But unfortunately it’s close now as new Istanbul airport is open.
4079,6454,Really big Airport and we had to change gates which took about 45min to walk between then. Our flight was great on board so we were intitled to free meal vouchers but no information available on where to get them. Found then but the selection of food was really limited at 23:00 which is not ok for an Airport that is open 24-7.
4080,6455,Really big Airport and we had to change gates which took about 45min to walk between then.

4081,6457,ATTTN. DEAR PERSON ATATÜRK AİRPORT CLOSED 2019 APRIL OF 6 TH TO ALL PSGRS FLTS . PLEASE TAKE ATTN... REGARDS
4082,6459,The new airport is huge. Plan in enough time to change planes. The Turkish Airlines gold lounge is amazing and has great food options.
4083,6460,"The new IST airport, is huge...! Walking from B gates to F gates, using all of the available travelators, took 27 minutes. Very nice airport."
4084,6462,"The new airport is pretty impressive. It is very large, modern, very well lit. The downside of being large is that you have to walk significantly between terminals. The WiFi was not working when I was there."
4085,6463,https://kureselgazete.com.tr is a global news site where you can find the most up-to-date breaking news from the world press.
4086,6468,Lovely Little Airport but the Wi-Fi was laggy and my bag took ages to come out the conveyer (no idea why) but it was good
4087,6470,Great experience nothing to complain about. Now that the metro goes all the way to the airport this makes SAW much easier to get to!
4088,6471,"It's very good that you can get to the airport by metro. One hour from Kadikey without transfers and you are at the airport. Very poor lounge zone before check-in, for sitting somewhere you need to go to the boarding place. Check-in is possible at special machines for each company of its own."
4089,6473,"Airport is old. Even it has been restored İzmir still needs a brand new airport. In my opinion, comparing the size and the busyness, the airport is operating very under the busyness limit. It can be a transfer airport. Some of the transit flights can be made at İzmir instead of İstanbul Sabiha Gökçen."
4090,6474,Significantly better than more than a few of the airports I've been in Turkey. Barely anyone in the domestic terminal as well.
4091,6475,"It is a very safe, comfortable and fast airport, but the taxi waiting area is complete chaos. And it's very expensive (one water is 30 lira)"
4092,6476,"Adnan Menderes airport was very clean, easy to find gates and the architecture is beautiful. The airport was perfect, not too small or not too big."
4093,6477,"It's simple and easy to use, and it's close to the station, so it's easy to use even for first-time users."
4094,6478,"Fantastic airport. If you have the choice to change through either Istanbul or Izmir choose Izmir, it is a much nicer and newer airport they are so kind there."
4095,6479,"This is my favorite airport! Just that there was a lot of queue at check-in, instead of this, just perfect..."
4096,6482,"No lavatories before first security check! Not able to login to free WiFi network with german mobile number, same problem as four years ago!"
4097,6486,"Very small airport. Consist of two 'terminals': departure and arrival. Lounges are too small for an international airport, so prepare for a very long que to check-in, most of the time all the way up to outside the airport building. Almost no facilities. Security check is very save as Turkish security checks are always done at the entrance of airports, however this often leads to que's outside of the building. There is no transportation from the terminal to the airplane, so you will have to walk over the tarmac (which is nice if you like airplanes, but could also present security risks). All in all, this airport needs expansion for it to be an adequate international airport."
4098,6487,Good CIP room for travellers. Security check is very boring in Turkey. But other things are ok. I used Turkish Airlines to flight Istanbul. Check in is very successful. WiFi is good enough. Waiting room is very small for an international airport.
4099,6488,Small but sufficient.
4100,6489,The airport looks like regional airport. Had a rough surface. Difficult to walk during boarding. Ground staff is helpful for wheelchair assist and very kind during check-in and boarding.
4101,6490,Konya airport is not good and not bad. Konya has a beautiful places like mosque parks... Turkey has better cities. Not recommended city.
4102,6491,hard to go airport. no have shuttle bus from goverment. need go your car also parking so expensive no free parking. no wifi
4103,6492,"Taxi fare from the bus station is 60TL. The most logical transportation is Havaş (12TL). The airport is smaller than Sabiha Gökçen. Since there is no bellows, you have the chance to walk on the apron and pull your plane."
4104,6500,"There was no Havaş service at the time of my flight. I wanted to come by public transportation, but I was worried about missing the plane because the bus did not arrive on time..."
4105,6501,Great modern airport. Kudos to Turkish government for such brilliant airports all around Turkey. Civil Aviation rises high in Turkey.
4106,6502,"The 2nd airport built completely on sea in the world, the 1st in Europe. Great modern terminal, very convenient distanced to both Ordu and Giresun cities, serving both."
4107,6508,"It is nice, but it needs to be improved and since Havaş, which provided transportation to the districts after the pandemic, was removed, multiple transfers need to be made. Havaş should start flights again."
4108,6510,"Small, but nice airport. The toilets are clean. There aren’t many shops or things to do so you shouldn’t arrive much earlier than the departure of your flight. The security check is the one of the fastest that I’ve ever seen."
4109,6511,"Trabzon herşeyile harika anlatılmaz yaşanır This city is perfect. Green and blue. Weather is humanity but very clear. When you come this city eating traditional food in the city. Köfte Akçaabat köfte, Salad piyaz"
4110,6512,"It is very close to the city center, right next to Trabzon's largest shopping mall, Forum AVM, and Karadeniz Technical University...."
4111,6513,This airport is very good
4112,6514,So little and you could find where you want
4113,6515,Aerodrome History In 1957 Trabzon Aerodrome was opened to traffic. In 29.11.1995 with the Number 503 decision of Directorate General board of directors it was brought into the status of the aerodrome. In our aerodrome while the service was given in order
4114,6523,"Airport is always extremely cramped and never enough seats. Often people standing and crowding the walkways. Boarding is also a nightmare. Not orderly at all, basically just a long line. The only thing that brings this up to a three star for me is the fact that you get to board from stairs, and get to walk on the ramp next to the planes. No lounge. Another plus is the deck, but you’re not allowed to take photos and are physically stopped. Taxis are easy to find to take you to the airport. Check-in is fairly fast depending on the airline. Security is quite a long wait but not too terrible. There is not enough bathrooms, and the Wi-Fi is mediocre at best, if you can even get connected to it. There are many food and retail services but all are packed."
4115,6526,"Very small airport, not modern. Wifi is very slow, but they have nice terrace for watching planes, no lounge. No priority security check."
4116,6528,The constant announcements to repeat the exact same thing every 30 seconds will drive you crazy -ie. that there is extra seating on the second floor and how to pass the security checks (even though you have already passed them)
4117,6529,"Small airport, security line managed well., lots of seats on both floors of the international departures area, frequent announcements regarding boarding of various flights, limited but adequate food options."
4118,6531,"Terminal facility much improved at Entebbe! About time, too... Unfortunately it was chaos at immigration and customs"
4119,6535,4-fold control PCR test and visa. Very annoying… Every immigration employee feels like the king who decides on your departure.
4120,6536,Improvement at airport for departing passengers. Only two security checkpoints instead of 3. Passport snag. Needed PRC to depart UG.
4121,6538,Really amazing view when taking off or landing during sunset or sunrise. The view of lake victoria was amazing. In 2020 it took $50 to reach mukono from the airport and $100 to reach the airport during covid.
4122,6542,"Been here few times. Not so bad airport. With these flight amounts it works just fine. Free wifi. Good little cafe. Check in is russian style but hey... it works too :) Arrival is sometimes a bit chaotic experience but it works too. Dont stress too much about it. Always had good service here. Helpful staff but little problems with english. Fast and cheap city transfer with taxi. One big problem at Dnepro airport: in the morning, especially in late winter / spring there are lots of fog. If this happens your flight will be delayed for sure. Also in heavy winter weather this airport is in trouble because equipments are quite outdated. Speciality at this airport: also army uses it so you can see some army stuff there too."
4123,6548,Was a great modern international airport for the region. Unfortunately to divert people's attention from miss rule and corruption the insecure Russian head of state funded and supported the destruction of this region. Expect more Ukrainian airports to be destroyed in mr Putin's modern roman games to appease the Russian people and to delay his inevitable fall.
4124,6550,"unfortunatly this airport doesn't exist anymore. I was destroyed in fights between ucrainian nazis and pro-russian rebells. The place, where over 1k ukrainian soldiers lost their lives in fight for USA's imperialistic ambitions. Донбассу слава, фашистам смерть."
4125,6554,"I was there on Euro-2012. Everything is good, there is the biggest runway in Ukraine here. There is spacious and modern, but too empty. It is unfortunate that it was damaged by militants, but we hope they will no longer be there. Good luck!"
4126,6558,"Great Vip terminal with post soviet modern architecture and restaurant near by. Airport itself is very modern, new and clean!"
4127,6559,"Security check at entrance door. which they do in summer season, sucks. Only one scanner and people line up in a huge queue outside even to pay for parking. Everything else is lovely."
4128,6560,"New and very nice airport. It is compact, but has all required facilities and services. Immigration/customs personnel improved a lot recently, they speak English and even smile, especially females."
4129,6562,"Kharkiv Airport is relatively small, though it’s nice. It has a beautiful design inside and outside. I passed through security checks quickly. There are some nice airside views in the waiting area. There is free WiFi in all the terminals."
4130,6564,"The border guards at this airport are simply rude. However, like almost all Ukrainian border guards. Although I am a citizen of Ukraine."
4131,6565,"Nice looking terminal made of glass. Sad that not as many planes are flying every day. No special shuttle bus, just public one."
4132,6566,"Very nice airport: a lot of place for only few passengers. WiFi, several cafes, power sockets under seats. Friendly staff. Cheap Taxi ($3-4 to city centre)."
4133,6567,"It's not very busy airport, thus it's pleasant, welcoming, and easy to use. The waiting times for check-in, passport and customs control, and air security checks are small. There are wifi and electric sockets available everywhere. The duty free shop is good too."
4134,6569,Really nice airport with really nice staff. the only thing I have to criticize about the airprot is the passport checks when your plane lands. Seemed to be no organisation and everyone was piled on top of each other. Apart from that its a really nice airport :D
4135,6570,"This airport is pretty compact. There are many ways to go the city using public transport (taxi, bus, train) which is really great. Arrival procedures are not great at all. The immigration lines inbound were a mess and the queues were not followed properly. There are a lot of hustlers outside the airport. For departure, check-in was a breeze and the security lines and immigration lines were also fast moving. There are quite a bit of restaurants to choose from at the landside part but airside though is a different story, it's fairly barren and there should be at least a fast-food chain there."
4136,6571,"KBP administration installed barrier to filter out taxi drivers who haven't paid bribe. Their own taxi is just more expensive but still random dirty cars. To steal just few $$ daily, they make experience of thousand passengers much worse."
4137,6574,"Nice, clean terminal, easy to get here but not at all the best restaurants and shops. There is good WiFi."

4139,6578,Quite old.. Easy to get to! Nobody at security check! Good wifi! Wasn’t much food or things to do. Lounge was like usual.
4140,6579,"The accessibility of public transport to the airport is very problematic, I advise all travelers to take a city train from the Station and go to Kyiv-Volynsky, there is literally one km on foot, but there are no traffic jams and no delays for the flight. The airport itself is small, corresponding to the second gate of Kyiv. I repeat, it is very difficult to get to the Terminal"
4141,6580,"Nice small domestic terminal with fast security and a nice coffee shop on departure, 2 minutes from plane to outside on arrival. Close to the city and accessible in around 25 minutes by bus to the central railway station. The museum located on the airport site is one of the largest collections in Ukraine, and for 100UAH (around €3) is worth a visit."
4142,6582,Small and cozy airport in center. Registration on the gate even if you did it online and do not have a baggage.
4143,6584,"Domestic terminal was soo tiny, but still modern. Just 4 check-in descs, one cafe, but it was not crowded. Good toilets."
4144,6585,"It was a domestic flight from terminal D. Quite clean and comfortable. But cafe inside the terminal working not stable. So, if you want to drink coffee or to buy water do it before you go to the gates."
4145,6586,"From/to city centre by trolley bus is price 4 krone. Travel time around 22min. Airport is nice, clean, one duty free shop, coffee bar and nice view to runway. Wifi free."
4146,6587,Very comfortable airport. Situated near city center. You can use public transport (trolleybus 9 and 22) to metro stations and city center.
4147,6590,"Nice, not too busy regional airport. Very close to city center, easy and remarkably cheap to reach by trolleybus #9, runs frequently. Shopping and catering inside is quite limited but food is cheap. Facilities are fine, nothing special."
4148,6592,Very good and modern airport. Super staff on check-in counters. Very clean. Needs more dutee frees and smoking areas. Bad Wi-Fi.
4149,6593,New terminal works like it should. Not too fancy though. Check in is always fast and pleasant. Staff are friendly. Luggage come fast after landing. Bar at gate level is nice. Free wifi. Best airport in Ukraine.
4150,6594,"New convenient regional airport. Easy to get to and from the city (trolley №9, bus №48). Everything is convenient and fast. Only one that is not happy is the complete lack of passengers and about 6-7 pairs of flights per day."
4151,6595,"Small, clean and convenient. Bit empty though. Duty free is pathetic. Food is more or less ok for non-hub. Relatively bad connection to popular hubs: no morning flights except to Kiev. It would be great to have at least 2-3 more destinations from here (Frankfurt, Amsterdam, London)."
4152,6596,Registration took a long time
4153,6598,"New good looking airport opened recently along with other infrastructure. Everything was very quick, we didn’t wait more than 5 minutes. Duty free shops and cafes are available. The only bad thing is that you can’t get to the airport by public transport. They cancelled the bus, and now you need to take old marshrutka and then walk 20-30 minutes, which takes forever. Taxis aren’t the most expensive ones but there are people who prefer public transportation."
4154,6599,"Security check was quite crwoded. One should reserve enough time for it in case there are several planes departing around the same time. Even though there are several Security lines available, only few of them were operating and the queuing system was far from perfectly organized. No priority lanes."
4155,6600,The airport is already completely new. The old terminal is closed. In the new terminal there are places to eat both in the check-in area and in the departure area. There is also duty free. The document control and boarding and departure area stations are on the second floor. To get there from the check-in area you have to go up an escalator. The most important thing is the new runway (RNW) with a length of 2800 m. and parking area. The 4 boarding hoses have been installed. Taxi at the airport costs 300-350 Ukrainian hryvnia. If you call Uber it will cost you 150-160 Ukrainian hryvnia. Taxi parking next to the terminal exit is free for the first 10 minutes and then costs 30 ukr grn. For this reason the taxi driver can also ask to pay this sum. To avoid paying the parking fee you can go 100 m to the old terminal where the taxi will pick you up.
4156,6603,"Nicely changed from last year, looks really spacious and sunny, especially check-in zone. Now it's full of passengers in summer, new cafe opened(prices are really high though). We got a transfer by Uber, but public transportation is available too."
4157,6606,"New airport terminal is modern and made of glass, but has s feeling of very small space. Toiles is not in a perfect condition. A lot of taxi drivers inside, which is kind of mafia."
4158,6607,"Not too bad taking into account that it is Soviet style building (new terminal has not yet been opened). The only bad thing is smoking area on the upper level that has a big hole in a door, so that cigarette smoke is almost everywhere."
4159,6608,My grandpa was sick and couldn't walk but the airport teams took very good care of him. So well done
4160,6609,"priority pass is not available in the business lounge. food and water can be bought for different prices: in shops for 40-50 rubles, in vending machines - for 80 rubles, in cafes for 120 rubles... It’s also cheaper to buy a snack in a store. Very comfortable waiting room. There is a terrace overlooking the airfield."
4161,6610,"Good new airport. Very beautiful, clean and traveller's friendly. But not very many sit places. Fast registration."
4162,6611,"I would say that now it's become a really good airport. All parts and servises are renovated and work good. The interior is nice. Baggage clame takes 15-20 min, i'd say. The latest time I used it was winter, hopes in summer it copes at same level. Wikipedia now has new photos of the airport;)"
4163,6612,"Views of mountains and valleys with cattle during landing.The airport looks really nice and modern after reconstruction. There is a taxi stand 5 meters away from the Arrivals exit. Baggage claim took a bit longer than I expected, though."
4164,6613,The airport was fully rebuilt and now it is capable to provide world class service for passengers. Since Ukr government has no longer access to passengers lists it becomes absolutely safe to travel to Crimea for anybody from all around the world through Moscow or any other Russian city.
4165,6614,"i was really surprised when I visited this airport again after 5 years. It was rebuilt in one year and became more comfortable for passengers. More than 20 years it was it was like a horror of nowadays, absolutely inconvenient and dirty. Ukrainian border guards especially liked small bribes and absolutely lazy. Now the situation dramatically changed, Thanks God"
4166,6616,"Since Crimea belongs to russia again, this airport is getting nicer day by day. I gonna let me surprise this summer, but last year, it was very good experience. Советую побывать, правда советую прилетать поутру."
4167,6621,"Anyone who wants to write a bad review, better shut up. A normal airport, just with its own jokes."
4168,6626,Dated terminal. hasn't been upgraded in more than 2 decades. The age is beginning to show. Very limited facilities. Exclusive to Etihad.
4169,6627,"I went here for a connecting flight. The terminal is quite small. There's free wifi, not much terminal facilities. I'm really looking forward at the new terminal!"
4170,6628,The new Terminal A is very good and is a big improvement from Terminal 1. The terminal is spacious and has some decent food options.
4171,6629,"Terminal A is a way better experience than Terminal 1. Some parts are still under construction but once it fully opens, it will truly be a great airport."
4172,6630,"It was very busy behind security, barely any seating available. Quite outdated but still well functional"
4173,6632,The old terminal of AUH airport feels really crowded during rush hours. Check-in and security was extremely fast and sufficient but the gate areas are small and lack facilities.
4174,6637,"Love the airport was able to use the Emirates First class lounge as I was emirates platinium, check in was quick but crowded, security check was super quick, terminal facilities are amazing, I didn't use the Airport wifi as I used the lounge WIFI, Food service was good, And the Lounge was 5/5 stars."
4175,6638,"As allways DXB is one of my faverout airports, terminal facilities are Amazing I didn't get to use WIFI as I was arriving, I wasn't in the lounge but the food there is amazing, the lounge it'self is Amazing and enormous (first class lounge) Immigration/customs took time even flying Emirates First class baggage claim was easy and quick as First class baggage has priority."
4176,6639,The check-in area is so small and packed. It takes quite a long time for the check in process. Not so much food selection in DXB.
4177,6640,"Unexpected and disastrous. Long and crowded queue in the immigration but not so many counters are opened. The estimated time is 20 mins turned out it was almost an hour. The terminal 1 (All flights except Emirates) is so small and old compared to other world-renowned airport. The airport exits and car parks are horrible, unorganised and uncivilised, I would say."
4178,6642,"You really cannot fault the way Dubai makes air travel so seamless, other countries should learn from the way DXB run the airport- all very efficient. Travelling with BA arrives into DXB terminal 1 with a short shuttle ride to the main terminal, but all very easy. On the way home boarding was made very simple by good control of the boarding groups meaning no pushing and shoving. LHR take note."
4179,6643,This is the BEST airport i’ve been too; other than Singapores Changi airport but everything is amazing and runs smooth plus there are some amazing plane spotting places for those aviation enthusiasts like me! :)
4180,6644,"Dubai international airport is a clean and modern airport, it can busy sometimes and queues get long but none the less it is mostsly a stress free airport, i would recommend flying there if you can."
4181,6645,"Great thanks to 1st, we had our own carer to get to the taxi. It was great, it was quick and easy. Little walking and a lot of driving"
4182,6646,"Very nice, neat and clean airport and also coordinated team. Your baggage is transferred from the plane very fast. With good wifi and good lounges and shops. I could find everything I was looking for, Absolutely recommend to visit this airport."
4183,6649,Very well organized airport. It is new and modern. Not many flights arrive on this airport which makes it very fast to go through the security and baggage claim. Hygiene is on top level. Public transport is easy to find outside the facility.
4184,6650,"Basic airport at the moment, speed of check in and security a plus but just too basic. But then again no one seems to want to go here unless forced. Mainly charter flights from Germany and Russia Perhaps things will get better No public transport to speak off"
4185,6651,"Very far outside Dubai (45km from Mall of the Emirates), >30Minutes by Taxi; in the middle of nowhere. People from BurDubai or Deira wouldn't like to depart from this airport (appr. 70km) Quick Check-in and security. Only 5 Airlines on Service here. No Lounges available, only 1 McDonalds, 1 Costa Cofee, no further facilities in terms of a Pub or Bistro. Airport is probably scheduled and built for Dubai EXPO 2020."
4186,6652,Rudimentary. A long way from civilisation. Very basic. At least few others use the airport thus no queues. Lounge was under construction thus a temporary one in place. Amex cardholders not welcome. Xxxxxx
4187,6655,"The most amazing airport in the world!!! Totally loved no queues, the most friendly staff in the world, showing real interest in your trip and doing everything to make your trip most pleasurable!!! Best Airport ever!!!"
4188,6656,"Visited this airport as part of a visit to Dubai and Doha, and as the QR flight times fitted in well with my plans thought it would be good to try, especially as QR had only been flying in there for a few weeks when I went through in Mid-March. The fact that there was only two flights on the board says it all - my 9am to Doha, and a Wizzair one roughly 12 hours later to Sophia. It has a large duty free, yet is heavily over staffed especially when there was only 20 people on our flight and the next lot of passengers is over 10 hours away. Catering is a single McDonalds. Literally in the middle of nowhere and is quite a distance from the city compared to DXB and takes roughly 35-40 mins (early in the morning) in a cab costing around 120 Dihrams. However, it has clearly been designed with the future in mind so will be interesting to go back and see it 10 years from now. Yet for any aviation enthusiast, and non enthusiasts alike it is definitely worth seeing for something designed for traffic levels which astronomically exceed what there presently is, if you don't mind the trek out and limited flight options of course."
4189,6657,"The airport is very nice and has clean facilities, offers great WiFi and the customs take a bit long wait but pretty straight forward. The Restaurants and shops are great but limited options."
4190,6658,A small & compact airport catering to the regional low cost airlines but saying this it is a very convenient airport for a quick entry & exit. Not much of tiresome walks to the gate. The security & immigration just took a few minutes & in no time we were at the gate. No five star facilities like the big airports but I prefer it as it saves times & very convenient.
4191,6659,They don't provide bridge to Pakistani flights which is very poor from them. There security check always has huge queue which is disturbing.
4192,6660,"Rather small airport. I didn't find lots of places to have a rest there. Early morning there were lots of people from eastern countries sleeping all over the place. food court is not very big, but ok."
4193,6661,"NO WIFI ON AIRPORT, LIMITED CHOICES FOR F&B , VERY VERY BASIC INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. WISH THEY EXPAND THEIR FECELITIES LOOKING AT THE UMBER OF FLIGHTS IN AND OUT OF SHARJAH"
4194,6662,"It's a bit dirty and crowded, but it's small, so immigration and baggage claim are quick. I even had to wait for my luggage."
4195,6663,"Very Good Airport, very less distance to walk from Immigration to security gate, Special Food court with at least 8-10 food outlets. Travelers should know that airport is not their destination to stay/live, so if less time for clearance by any airport is the best airport. Sometime clearance time at Sharjah Airport from landing to parking lot is only 20 minutes)"
4196,6666,the arabs :<
4197,6667,"There is a bus from the bus terminal to the airport. It is not a dedicated express service, so airport passengers share the service with shoppers and commuters. There are no luggage racks, so I would imagine that the bus can get quite crowded at certain times. It only takes about 40 ins, but I wouldn't like to be in a hurry. Check-in was quick oce it opened 20 mis after the scheduled time. Despite an EasyJet flight to London leaving around the same time, I was through security in a couple of minutes. Airside has a lot of place to shop, eat and drink. It is very spacious, however, if you are departing from one of the higher numbered gates, be aware that they are at the far left of the terminal and there is just a toilet there. The airport is operated by the same company as GLA with the same WiFi provider. It works fine with 2 hours free usage, but I wasn't able to activate my VPN."
4198,6668,"If arriving on a domestic flight then it is very easy to get through the airport. I was off the plane and in a taxi within 5 minutes, however, I did not have any bags to collect as I was travelling with just a carry on"
4199,6669,It took longer to get our bags than the flight lasted over 1hour 10 minutes we waited and we were the only flight to land
4200,6670,Amazing I love that my home city has such an amazing airport it has a lot of shops and the restaurants are really good quality
4201,6671,Nice little airport but very few options for food. Only Costa and 1 restaurant was open (the other one was closed) There was a huge line for Loganair and British Airways check-in so I reccomend online checkin
4202,6673,"Domestic arrivals was very slick, off plane and thru to the airport exit in less than 5 mins. Returning however was a different story. Queuing for security from the boarding card gates, 15 mins later I find only 3 lines and 1 working! Can imagine in busier times this would be quite a nightmare. The people working these were courteous however. Airside, plenty of eating areas and a decent duty free area. A lot of available seating but not of good quality. Everything else seemed fine"
4203,6674,"A really good local airport, free terminal wide wifi and short security lines. Bring something to read/watch as there is little to do in the terminal in the event of a delay."
4204,6675,"This was strange - usually the disembarking process is terrible and the bags take forever to arrive. However, this time, off in five minutes and bags waiting. Incredible.... Still a rubbish airport though!"
4205,6677,"BRR is a tiny, intimate airport. Check-in and security are a breeze. There are limited facilities, but the lounge has a great view over the vast beach bay which doubles as the runway."
4206,6678,"BRR is the smallest airport I have used. It is a breeze. No queues at check-in. Baggage claim is a shelter at the side of the terminal. And the plane lands on the beach. Due to Covid-19, the local buses were not running, but a short and relatively inexpensive taxi ride will get you to/from the airport. Don't expect designer shops, but the most relaxed airport I have been in in Europe."
4207,6679,"If arriving on a Sunday, make sure to pre-book your onward travels. There are no buses on Sundays, and when I tried phoning all four of the taxis on the island, none were available. (Trying again an hour or two later, I managed to reach one who was available). Mobile phone reception across Barra is poor - at the airport, there is no signal inside the building, but if you step outside you may get a signal. Barra airport's staff are lovely, helpful people, however, so you will be in good hands even if you mess up. The cafe serves nice food (better food than I expected to be honest), the ""terminal"" is a cozy place, and I would highly recommend going to the cafe before you fly (or after you land). It's open for walkers / cyclists as well as airport users, and I'd happily recommend it to anyone on the island. Good food, lovely place & lovely staff."
4208,6680,Was only there on a day trip so not a lot of time but the beaches are amazing.....so clean and silvery looking sand. If the weather was warmer in summer they would be great. Quick visit to Castlebay and really not much to see/do.
4209,6681,What a wonderfully strange Airport!
4210,6682,"Surprisingly comfortable airport for being so small. Enough coffee shops and a restaurant, as well as shopping, to keep you entertained for awhile. Customs are horribly slow if you're coming in from a Schengen country and they'll grill you about your plans. If you have a choice of where to layover before flying to BHD, choose another UK airport (especially LHR), where you can clear UK customs there, rather than at BHD."
4211,6684,The security lines at BHD seem particularly inefficient. There must be ways to channel the flow more effectively.
4212,6685,"Small airport, very efficient and extremely close to the city. Luggage drop off and check in is possible only 2 hours prior boarding. Very good Aspire lounge. No queues at the security even during rush hours!"
4213,6686,"Check-in and security weren't to the expected and usual standard, but there were a lot more passengers than usual for the time of day. Lounge was exceptional as always, and not too busy either."
4214,6687,Tiny airport. Not a lot of seating. Not many facilities. The lounge was closed for the guts of two years after covid which was much longer than other airports.
4215,6688,This is my favourite regional airport. The facilities are excellent considering the size of the operation and it's a quick efficient service. Everything so close to hand. Well done BHD.
4216,6689,"Really good experience, very fast to get through security. Online ticker for the flights was great, was able to subscribe to updates on my flight to whatsapp."
4217,6690,I arrived by train and the airport is a 10 minute walk from station. Security was well organised and flowed well. The departure lounge was busy due to a few delayed flights. There is not a wide range of shops however the airport has added vending machines to address this.
4218,6691,"It’s a great wee airport, security with one lane and a bit busy was still about 5 minutes, there’s a good selection of shops for it being a domestic airport however it does lack in some parts. There is no lack of comfortable seating with a partnership with a office furniture firm proving great seating with charging points and USBs. Boarding was still good and efficiently quick gate announced, go to gate and get into the wee queue to go onto the apron for about 3 minutes and on the plane you are, 10/10 airport"
4219,6692,"As always, BFS was well organised and everything ran smoothly. This is a fantastic airport that may would be quick to speak poorly of. But there is no justification to do so."
4220,6693,"Brilliant airport that gets a hard time with negative reviews. Far superior to the other Belfast airport in service, facilities and ease of use"
4221,6694,"Easy to get to the airport. No self check-in which I haven't seen in a while. It took about 15 minutes at 4am. Security was normal, about 10 minutes in line."
4222,6696,"It was a good improvement, quick through security, just clean and everything was what you expected from a decent airport"
4223,6697,"It is pretty but small international airport, which is big enough for the traffic that is there. One think I didnt like was very small baggage reclaim area, luckily our flight was there alone but If there were more than 2 flights, it could have been chaos there."
4224,6699,The airport was quiet the morning we went! Security not too long except for people breaking the line dividers and skipping the line but overall good experience.
4225,6700,Belfast International is a beautiful airport it is also my local airport they have just added a Starbucks
4226,6702,I think the service at Birmingham Airport was very good just a few delays and queues but you would expect that at an airport anyway so other than that realy good
4227,6703,"I lost my luggage, waited for 3 hours, and nobody at the airport to advise. The baggage reclaim window was without an attendant for a long time"
4228,6705,Ongoing construction is a bit painful. Fat track is. bit of a joke because once you get to the security check point you have to queue because there is only 1 security point which is painfully slow because its not a designated x-ray machine for passengers and is shared with non paying. WiFi is pretty useless
4229,6707,Train Strike and not enough buses so had to get a taxi and unless you pay £4 extra will be dropped at parking area rather than terminal. Walk to terminal is 5 to 10 minutes. Security was fine but this was last flight of day so no queues. Gate 56 had no seats so people had to sit on floor. All in all then not a great airport
4230,6708,A long walk and shuttle train to public transport area. Trains were on strike through part of the day and buses not too frequent
4231,6709,Paid extra for fast track security lane but it was actually slower than the usual queue. Other than that check in and boarding was quick.
4232,6710,Back to usual delay of getting off the aircraft. 15 minute wait for ambulift. Even ATC seemed to struggle by sending us on a detour before landing despite previous aircraft landed 10 minutes before us. An airport whuch cannot get its act together
4233,6713,"Blackpool was a handy alternative to MAN when visiting the NW of England. It is a small airport with few flights meaning that airport was very quite and easy to travers. Most onward connections required travel to Blackpool itself, but from there there are good connections."
4234,6715,"Used to use it regularly but they stopped the flights I used, sad to see it closed, Wonder if Balfour Beatty had planned to close it from the time they took over as they have done nothing to improve it since taking over"
4235,6717,Blackpool is a great airport with the best flight time on all flights
4236,6718,"Great little international airport, so much more accessible, than most of the other larger ones."
4237,6720,small airport. fast check in a few facilities walk to aircraft not much overhead locker space
4238,6721,It's really a great airport
4239,6722,Easy and quick arrival
4240,6723,"Great airport to depart from. After arriving there is a long queue to passport control so be sure to get off the plane first, friendly officers though."
4241,6725,Not the easiest to get to especially in terms of public transport as there is not much but a nice small airport that does everything you need even though there is not any facilities
4242,6726,"Very small airport, arrivals is essentially a hangar with some painted walls, cold and not very welcoming. Ends up not being that cheap either when you need to take a taxi to the station because there's no bus running (certainly at 8 at night on a Saturday)"
4243,6727,Staff for disabled flight assistance always very helpful and friendly. they asked us how our holiday was. very nice experiene to be welcomed back. thank you
4244,6728,Bournemouth airport is a great airport. When you park in the car park you just walk straight into the terminal and can go straight to check in. The security gets you through quite fast even though they pull you over to check items so they have something to do. The departure lounge is quite small but it has all the shops that you need. The only bad thing about this airport is that when it's 10 mins before boarding they put you in this small room with no air so it is easy to get a cold or something in there. But we got boarded in 10 minutes and we got a early departure because it's a small airport. Out of 10 i give it a 10.......
4245,6729,"Great airport to fly out of, free WiFi throughout and a non stressful experience like Gatwick or Heathrow. Would recommend flying out of Bournemouth!"
4246,6730,"New airport terminal, very clean, very light and airy, easy to get your way around it as its fairly small, flights usually on time. Duty free is very nice as well. Airport is very easy to get to, mainly locals use the airport, lots of taxi's and buses that can get you to the airport. 'The Olive Tree' is a nice cafe/restaurant, with a televisions that shows BBC1, food is fairly expensive but that's probably the same in most airports. Good experience overall."
4247,6733,"It was a long walk from the aircraft until we entered the terminal building. There is little landside; a currency exchange, M&S and a couple of coffee shops. I only had a ten minute wait for the bus to the city. £9 one way to the city is a bit much. For a journey time of around thirty minutes."
4248,6734,"Small but very busy airport. There are a lot of ULCC flights from here to EU destinations. EasyJet supplies several Domestic Destinations. The security check-in can get hectic at times early in the morning when there are a lot of flights departing. Currently, the parking is disrupted with a long walk to the terminal due to rebuilding work"
4249,6736,Reasonably quick after security. But security is busy and slow and the fast track line is just as slow as the main line. The Silver parking is atrocious.
4250,6737,As much as i am into my planes & flying the airport was really interesting to see the scale & how much work was put into making it a good ideal airport
4251,6738,"Despite being early and being told to come back to check in, we had to walk through the bag drop area and just checked our bags in anyway. Airport is small but you have everything you need. Nice addition to be able to book into a lounge prior to the flight. Make sure you pre book as they have limit space and we’re turning people away. Security fast track was £7 and looking at the queue for security we decided to pay for it."
4252,6739,I love Bristol as it is always so clean! The security agents were very calm and were friendly when I was taking out my electronics. The duty free is just amazing!
4253,6741,A pain to get to/ from and lousy bag drop with easyJet. Didn’t use the lounge this time but am told that it is much improved since my last visit.
4254,6742,"Bristol Airport is a pretty small but decent airport, I liked it but it doesn't have a big variety at duty free. Transport is very easy to use there."
4255,6746,"The airport is a fair distance from the city centre. There is a train and connecting bus the city to the airport. I was travelling from Barry and took a local bus. Landside, there is a Greggs upstairs, but little else. In January, there are only a few flights per day. I was at the airport early and was one of the first in line for check-in. The only other flight was a Ryanair flight which was announcing last boarding call while I was waiting. Security took only 2-3 minutes. The departure lounge is spacious. What it would be like in the summer, I can only guess. Being one of the first through security and with the Ryanair flight away, there were no queues for the cafe or bar restaurant. The last flight of the day flashed as cancelled and shortly after, the staff began taking the menues off the tables in the restraurant. There is a decent view over the south portion of the apron and the approach for runway 30. The WiFi is good, and a few details gives 2 hours of free access."
4256,6747,Small airport and quiet and efficient for this the last flight of the day. Bars and cafes still open though . Bus 304 from Cardiff to airport even in the evening with no traffic took some time and passes through Barry enroute
4257,6748,I am a Cardiffian so very familiar with the airport and what it lacks in facilities it makes up for in convenience.
4258,6749,Being so close together and being penned together at the gate whilst waiting to board is always a bit uncomfortable.
4259,6750,"Arrived on a domestic flight without bags so didn't really experience a full arrivals experience. However, we were straight off the aircraft and almost instantly into arrivals. Toilets were clean. Cashpoint available straight after arrivals. Easy to find buses outside of the terminal."
4260,6751,"Airport is a good 30 minute drive from central Cardiff and there’s no train option. Arriving at Cardiff is never a nice affair - you have to go up and down multiple sets of stairs to get from the aircraft to immigration - not great for those who don’t necessarily need assistance but are only just managing, so think ahead on this. Small set of immigration gates (5) and around 5 counters. Walked straight to the front of the queue as there weren’t any other aircraft arriving the same time as ours. Departing from Cardiff is a sad affair - one pub which offers food and some small other shops, but very much lacking services compared to other regional airports such as Bristol."
4261,6752,"Cardiff is a good little airport but it does have a limited option of food outlets as it only has Costa, Cafe Ritazza and a pub style outlet called the Beer House, it also has a good sized WH Smith. The lounge is nice but not large and doesn't serve hot food but has a good range of snacks."
4262,6753,"Security was fast, 2h free wifi worked well, some good shops and 1,5 restaurants :D Nice little airport with really short ways!"
4263,6755,"The best airport I've been so far. It's small but very spacious and well organized. Well served by buses, even at four in the morning I could easily get a bus to the airport. The staff is very friendly, they even offered to take a photo of me and my husband. Would like my home airport to be like that!"
4264,6756,Londonderry is a beautiful little airport it shows much potential it’s a shame they don’t use it. A lot more than the current 4 flights a day.
4265,6757,"Derry Airport is tiny, but in the best possible way. There's no getting lost, the staff have that small-town vibe and are eager to help, and it's easy and cheap to get to the city centre. You can either hop on the bus for a handful of change, or pay a bit more than twice that and take a cab into town. It was also really charming to see a pen full of frolicking sheep almost right outside the airport. Nice little sight to happen upon first thing in the morning."
4266,6758,"I only live 20 minutes away in Limavady. I have a Airband Radio and listen to incoming and outgoing flights. Small airport but very useful for travel. The runway is short and the only biggest aircraft operated here is a B738. If your looking for a short stay then you will be happy to know that Premier Inn is close by which will accomodate your stay but also including the Airport Lodge Hotel. The Airport has a small and quick security checkpoint, up to ten check in desks, a small shop before check in and a cafe after check in. Just like any other airport it is one of the most well known for Ryanair flights and TUIfly (seasonal). The Airport used to hold airlines such as Flybe, Easyjet and bmi baby. The airport is the best arrival point for a special holiday in the wonderful Derry City."
4267,6762,"Nice airport, friendly and patient ATSU. Runway is asphalt and well kept, equiped with Papis too."
4268,6763,"A beautiful airport with a stunning terminal (although closed). The airport handles cargo flights, private flights and GA"
4269,6764,RUN DOWN TERMINAL.
4270,6765,"Service at DSA was excellent, we were in Vip lounge 20mins after arriving at airport. Staff were friendly and helpful as my wife uses a wheelchair to get around"
4271,6766,The departure terminal has been improved over recent years with a Subway and now a Costa comfortable outlet.
4272,6767,"I always try to use this airport. Put it this way: In 2018 Which Magazine' voted this as the best UK airport (passengers under 10 million/year). In 2018 'SAGA Magazine', in a survey of 9,000 readers, voted this the best UK airport. How's that for a recommendation."
4273,6768,"Very loud airport around the time we arrived, there is no full separation between landside and airside therefore this creates a lot of discomfort before the flight. Free WiFi for only 30 minutes and then £9 a day is the only option. So if one need another half an hour or an hour needs to pay £9 which is extortionate"
4274,6769,The whole airport experience can be described as peaceful. Arriving at the airport is very easy with very little traffic. Check-in/bag drop began 2 hours before our flight to Spain. There is free wifi for half an hour. Security is smooth with normally very small queues or none at all. There are not loads of amenities but enough for the airport.
4275,6771,"It's only a tiny and relatively still new airport but its staff, including volunteers pre-check-in are all full of heart and are helpful. Try the small Premier lounge if you have more than an hour to wait. Although it gets busy quickly. Top menu item - fish finger sandwiches! You know you're in Yorkshire"
4276,6772,"Being 30 minutes from my home and with a good selection of destinations, I have used this airport since it opened and have never been disappointed. OK, some other airports may have a wider range of outlets etc but they lack the personal feeling of Robin Hood Doncaster Sheffield Airport (RHDSA) and its relaxed nature and parking (including charges). Having previously used Heathrow, Gatwick, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds Bradford and Humberside airports, RHDSA is ALWAYS my preferred airport."
4277,6773,"Getting to the airport is alright but not great. The airport still needs to be linked up by a M18 spur road, but given that the surrounding area isn't very busy; it doesn't take long. Arriving at the terminal there was a few people at the check-in desks. I continued on my way through to security upstairs which was slightly busy but only took about 5 minutes. The Terminal facilities are good enough for an airport its size. There is plenty of seating more importantly, especially overlooking the tarmac and the runway."
4278,6774,"Robin Hood is always good. Easy commute for East Midlands and South Yorkshire people. Check-in quick same as security. WiFi is slow but descant, and view of apron great. WHSmith, Weatherspoons and DutyFree available. Very good airport!"
4279,6776,"The bag drop was quiet as was security. It was just 5 mins from scanning my boarding pass to my bag re-packed after security. The WiFi is strong and easy to access, but it faded after 30 mins. The Wetherspoons bar sells real ales unlike the one in Glasgow airport. It was probably about £1.50 more than outside, but probably still cheaper than the lagers."
4280,6777,This was probably my best experience of arriving in EDI. Probably because it is the only time that I have arrived domestically and didn't have to dealwith the immigration hall. It was a long walk from the gate to the domestic baggage claim. I still had to wait 10 minutes for my case. I got out of the terminalwith a few minutes to wait for the Glasgow express bus. So all was well.
4281,6778,"The departures Hall works as it says on the box. No lasting memories of Scotland but that of an international airport. However the arrivals Hall remains amongst the worst of the airports I have been through. Often low on directional signs, puddles to walk through due to bad drainage and a cold and draughty passport Hall. The people are the saving grace here."
4282,6779,"Regular bus services that take you to City Centre and other destinations. Baggage claim could do with a refurbishment though, as it is very metal and you can see the wires handling on the ceiling. In Oslo Lufthavn (Airport,) it is clean, modern, and wooden."
4283,6780,The entrance to the airport was very crowded and unorganised but the actual services were very good
4284,6781,Small but mighty airport. The gate area could have been much better. It's quite small and cramped and it wasn't very obvious where exactly to enter at first. Still overall a decent experience.
4285,6782,"Being the last flight out of Edinburgh meant that some of the shops and restaurants were not open. At check-in, I had to carry my own baggage over to the conveyer belt. That would be difficult for a less able person."
4286,6783,"I usually hate arriving in EDI as the immigaration process takes far too log. I was pleasantly surprised on this occassion and I was though in just 4 mins. Due to our late arrival, I had missed the coach to Glasgow that I was booked on. The coaches are frequent, so I only had to wait for 20 mins. I have a concession bus pass, so didn't have to pay for a new ticket."
4287,6784,"The overnight snow didn't materialise, so travel to the airport was smooth using the airport coach from Glasgow. Security was busy, but the queue was quick moving. It was just 7 mins from boarding pass check to repacked. The departure lounge was very busy all all the bars and restaurants were crammed or had queues to get in. I decided not to bother. The gate was announced an hour before departure time and I headed there straight away."
4288,6786,"Deeply average regional airport, I like that they have a half hourly bus to the city centre and that there’s an outdoor viewing area"
4289,6787,Exeter airport very nice and easy to navigate through. Lounge was very nice with very friendly staff. Nice quality food in the lounge. Great views of the runway and aircraft stands.
4290,6788,Easy access and fast boarding. Services aren’t the best but shouldn’t expect too much from a small airport on a Sunday morning.
4291,6789,Easy Check in and bag drop no queue at counter. Security on a 5min queue. Small airport so only a few shops so advise to get there a little later towards check in close time if you don’t want to be waiting around forever. (Or with wining kids!!)
4292,6790,"Got through check-in and Border Control quickly, but otherwise the same old airport. not much improvement over the years, but still nice to fly from your local airport."
4293,6792,"Super fast baggage claim, very convenient airport. The number of routes operated from the airport should increase, though."
4294,6793,"Much improved on last year, with no problems at check-in and straight through security checks which has changed for the better. Well done."
4295,6794,I fly through Exeter at least twice a year. It has greatly improved in the past year with the introduction of the new security area which has speeded up screening considerably. Check in is always quick and parking is close by. The airport has good road connections for those of us living in the South West. It's a good local airport - it's not Gatwick or Heathrow but that's not a bad thing in my view. I've never had any sort of delay travelling into or out of Exeter - I can't say that about 'bigger' airports.
4296,6798,"The barriers giving access to the terminal were very slow that day. It took the bus that I was on five mins to get through due to each vehicle taking about a minute to clear the double barrier. I entered the terminal at 18:30 and between then and my flight at 20:05 there were only seven flights. All domestic. The check in hall was empty and security had no queue. It took me five mins from boarding pass check to packed and leaving security. It would have been quicker, but my bag got pulled for a swab test. There were no queues and plenty of seats available in the food and drink outlets. There were plenty of general seats available too. The WiFi was working perfectly. I couldn't load my VPN, but I'm finding this to be the case more often."
4297,6799,"There was a TUI 787-8 departing around the same time as my flight. This probably accounted for the longer queue for security than usual, but still only 14 mins to clear. The departure lounge was also busier, but there were still seats available, including in the bars and restaurants. The toilet cubicles near the Weathersppons bar are quite tight with inward opening doors. It is quite a struggle to close the door when travelling with a carry-on case."
4298,6800,"I normally don't have an issue with security at GLA, but this time took me 20 minutes. Long by my previous experiences at this airport. There are usually fewer flights arriving internationally late in the day, but on this occasion a Wizz A321 had landed just before us a this created a queue which moved slowly. I just missed the bus that I was planning to catch and had to make alternative arrangements. The express bus to the city centre is fast and frequent, at a bit expensive at £10 one-way. Late at night most of the services are closed, but the M&S is usually open till late."
4299,6801,"The Airport is good, I definitely recommend going there, everything is very good and I like it very much."
4300,6802,"Since it was an early flight, I had stayed in one of the nearby hotels. The other airport hotels have an easier walk to the terminal. Clearing security took 8 minutes and the departure lounge was relatively quiet. The WiFi wasn't working initially. When it did it was pretty good with 2 hours free use."
4301,6803,"We arrived at the domestic terminal and were bused to the international terminal. There were two buses to take us there, but they started filling the one at the rear first. As I was one of the last people on the rear bus, and the front bus having only a few people on it. I managed to join the immigration queue near the front and was soon in the arrivals hall. The bus that I was catching was due in a few minutes and I was on my way home."
4302,6804,"I had a very early flight, around the same time as numerous Jet2 flights depart. I arrived very early to avoid the queues. There were no queues at security and I was through as probably one of the first 100 passengers in the departure lounge. I had my choice of where to sit and eat. I had a bacon roll and coffee in the Weatherspoons outlet. There was plenty of bacon, but the roll was very small. At £11, I found it a bit excessive."
4303,6805,Yet another UK airport where Wi-fi was impossible to pick up. Was able to pick up the signal but unable to logon to the network.
4304,6806,"It's a fair walk after disembarking before entering the terminal building. Once there, it is straightforward to exit. I had missed a bus by a few minutes and had about 30 minutes to wait for the next one. There are plenty of shops, etc. in the public area."
4305,6807,"The flight arrived just after the A380 from DXB, so the arrivals hall was a little busier than it normally is. I was sure that my case hadn't transfered in AMS, but the baggage handling agent said that I had to wait. I was not the only person with baggage issues and it took a long time to be dealt with. My case arrived the following day, despite there being at least one other flight from AMS to GLA that day. I was a lot later leaving the airport than expected as there was also a queue at immigration."
4306,6808,"There is a coach from Glasgow to the airport specifically for the early morning flights. Being a quiet airport, check-in and security are pretty quick. Once through to the airside the facilities are limited."
4307,6809,"Arriving in PIK is very straightforward. Even before Ryanair transferred most of their flights to GLA, their were never too many flights arriving on a daily basis. Therefore, there were never any delays in arriving and taxying time and disembarking was speedy. Baggage claim seldom caused a delay and then it was a short walk to the train station to central Glasgow. The trains are pretty regular, but it is a lengthy journey."
4308,6810,"Prestwick airside is very old fashioned and hasn't been renovated since PIK was Scotland's transatlantic gateway. However, it is very easy to travel through. The transport links are good, but it does feel out of the way."
4309,6811,"Prestwick Airport is a small Airport with a Bar and Shop and Few eateries in Departure Lounge,small and efficient Airport with quick time to get security clearance."
4310,6813,Check in was easy and fast. not a lot of options for food with the duty free being quite costly. .................................................................... ...............................................................................
4311,6814,"Prestwick airport is the best airport I have ever been to. There is speedy check in, extra fast security. once it took me 5 minuets just to get through, including a pat down. There is just one restaurant after security which is pretty good, Nuance duty free and a Whsmith. This airport is better than Glasgow Int and way better than Newcastle or Manchester. I hope different airlines start flying from here, as only Ryanair is."
4312,6815,"I went on holiday in July through Ryanair at Prestwick Airport. It's a nice quiet airport, got checked in within 2 mins, and security was just as fast. The flight also departed early, so overall i had a great experience with the airport."
4313,6816,First flight of the day and through check in and security very fast. When through security there was little open facilities. It was around 5:30 in the morning at this point. Very poor from a plane spotters point of view as there was no windows after you have gone through security so it is not possible to watch aircraft while waiting for your flight.
4314,6817,I really liked it! but I don't think they do the security check right here. my friend had liquids in his bag but forgot to put them in the tray and they didn't notice. other than that it was lovely! but I think that the food village is very expensive.
4315,6820,Humberside is very quiet and that is what makes it so good. The facilities have been refurbished. The landside restaurant cafe is very nice and features the history of the airport on the walls. Check-in was quick as was security. The departure lounge is small and pleasant. Wifi is inconsistent but free. There is a bar that servces food in the departure lounge and a duty free shop.
4316,6821,"If you are transiting in Europe it is the Airport to use. 40 minute inter European is possible and about 1 hour for long-haul apart from USA, about 90 minutes to be on safe side. KLM lounges are very good as is their WiFi, airport WiFi can be a bit hit and miss. Presently a lot of construction going on."
4317,6822,"Small airport with limited schedule flights, Aberdeen & Amsterdam only. Small shop and café/bar that does not open until first flights of day depart!! security is usually smooth but if there is a charter flight in as well can be up to 1 hour to get through. Business lounge supplies the basics but no hot snacks. Humber flyer bus serves hourly otherwise you need to travel by car/taxi. As a convenient easy to use local it serves its purpose."
4318,6823,"Small airport however there are sometimes huge ques for security. They're fuss pots in security, when someone walked through the scanner they got searched.It took me about 15-20 mins to get through. APART FROM THAT IT WAS GOOD!"
4319,6825,"Nothing too bad, the airport itself is rather interesting, or not. But the airport overall is good and not bad."
4320,6826,"not much to do after security, there’s a whsmith and a bar - that’s it! however security were very good with me, toilets clean etc."
4321,6827,Runway rough needs resurfacing. Massive windows in airport lounge great to see everything going on at the airport airside .
4322,6828,Airport bus from inverness bus station detours to shopping park then airport . Their trying hard in a small terminal but queues can back up and joining wrong queue not unknown . Security seem to be heavy on drug/explosive check on my trainers ! Massive windows in lounge so see all of runway and most of hardstand . RUNWAY IS A LITTLE ROUGH NEEDS RESURFACING
4323,6829,"It's a good regional airport. You're a bit stuck for choice if you choose to go through departures however, you're bored until departure."
4324,6830,A great little airport - can get busy especially when easyJet flights are boarding. Getting to the airport is possible via taxi or public bus. The lounge is tiny but perfect!
4325,6831,"Very small and could do with an upgrade. As an aviation enthusiast I would love to see more airlines and aircraft in Inverness however that would require a runway upgrade/expansion as the current runway can only take a certain aircraft weight due to it sinking into the wet earth below it, the same problem with Cork/ORK in the south of Ireland. Both airports were once a thriving place of multiculturalism however these factors have been limiting the effect of multiculturalism growth in the region. On a busy day Inverness Airport cant cope with passenger numbers with only three departure gates and two security scanners (which most of the time only one scanner is being used), the shops are quite expensive. The airport also has very little to do once passed security. Overall I would spend a little more money and buy a train ticket and fly out of Aberdeen, Glasgow or Edinburgh."
4326,6832,Much Improved since last time there. Security and screening staff a bit stiff and dull. Maybe just having a bad day! The airport as a whole is nice and clean and the shops are quite good although expensive.
4327,6833,"This is my local airport. Its pretty small, but you will find most things you need like a cafe and a few small shops. The thing that makes Inverness are its staff. They are great. Love flying from Inverness."
4328,6834,"Inverness airport is small, just 3 departure gates. The departure lounge can get very busy if all three gates are needed at similar times, 3 flights = 400-500 people which there isn't really space for. Security can be slow at times, there are only two x-ray machines and often only one is in use. There is a cafe and coffee bar land-side, although the coffee place doesn't open early. Airside you have a coffee bar and a newspaper kiosk, so don't expect much to kill time at the airport. Transport to/from the airport is taxi or bus, although no buses early morning or late night. If you are arriving off a busy flight, best to book a taxi."
4329,6835,"Very small airport with all the advantages and disadvantages. Security was extremely thorough. Both I and my bag were subject to separate random checks, and several people had thorough searches done. No possible stone was unturned."
4330,6836,"I departed on a Sunday and no buses run on Sundays, so alternative arrangements have to be made. The flight was full and must people arrived at much the same time, so there was a small queue at check-in. The security check was a breeze, but the trays are small and in short supply. The terminal is small and functional. The cafe was closed, possibly covid related. The departure lounge is a sufficient size for the size of aircraft used on the route, but there were fewer seat, agai nprobably covid related to maintain social distancing."
4331,6837,"Arrival is straightforward. A short taxi to the stand and a short walk into the terminal building. Plenty of space in the small terminal for waiting for your baggage. A friendly local offered me a lift to my destination, Bowmore. I would have caught the local bus otherwise."
4332,6838,biggest airport ever seen ;-)
4333,6839,Great airport with fantastic staff. Only one airline bothers to fly here since (Flybe tucked tail and ran) and they do a great job considering the challenges of flying to remote areas in the Highland and Islands.
4334,6840,"Nice little regional airport with quick and convenient bus link to downtown Kirkwall. Small-scale operations, friendly atmispehere, relaxing place to depart from or to arrive."
4335,6841,"A regional airport serving the Orkney Islands, with a surprisingly expensive cafe! Access to the airport is via local bus which meets all the flights. Friendly staff and not much more to say really."
4336,6842,"Nice little airport,small shop,small bar,but ok,friendly enough,but not over helpful staff.Great if you like a pretty airport with odd aircraft knocking about,like Britten Norman Islanders flying off to small islands,Kirwall is a good place to visit."
4337,6846,"Arrived at a bus gate, process of getting on and off the bus was swift. Customs literally only took a few seconds, staff were very kind. A selection of a few shops and bars was more than enough at this rather small airport. My only complaint is that the Wifi did not work."
4338,6848,"As long as there are not many flights it is a nice cosy airport, however if there are many it must be crowded and claustrophobic. Very nice staff"
4339,6849,Very easy to get through immigrations/customs only took about 5 minuets was quick and easy. Very kind staff.
4340,6850,Found it very hard to find what carpark we was in as instructions were not clear. We got though security within 10 minuets but there is not much to do while at the airport with very little food choice. just felt like a normal building.
4341,6851,"If given scope for transportation development, and terminal/runway expansion, LBA could become a class-leading airport in the UK."
4342,6852,We used fast track it was really quick getting through security. We also did twilight check in so no worrying about check in early hours of the morning.
4343,6857,Good airport very minor queues but that’s in non peak season clean airport and nice duty free shop e.t.c
4344,6858,Checkin quick and efficient Security was seamlrsd Limited shops Boarding was quick despite a full flight
4345,6859,Took 10 minutes ish to get off the plane and get out of the airport and I had to wait for baggage too! Now thats very good for an airport.
4346,6860,"I hated it, the baggage claim was delayed by an hour when I got back, but still liked it when I got my flight."
4347,6861,Does the job for an airport of its size. Can get a Just Park cheaply surrounding the airport. Always have a bit of a moan about security here as they charge for liquid bags - the only airport I've seen this at in the UK.
4348,6862,Looks a it run down to be honest. Charging for WiFi is OLD HAT!!! I needed it cos my mobile operator let me down. Pint of Beer SO EXPENSIVE!!!!!!!! Robbery!
4349,6864,had to be searched multiple times even though i didn't have anything and the machines kept flagging something
4350,6865,I only was leaving the airport but it was quick and easy to leave it’s a nice little city airport overall.
4351,6866,Amazing airport the staff are so polite and helpful wouldn't want a better airport. Personally I like to go there 5 hours before the flight because yes I'm an avgeek and the window in departures by gate 8-10 is phenomenal
4352,6867,"This is my favourite airport, the location(GREAT) the staff(GREAT) the queues (GREAT) everything in this airport is fantastic i so strongly recommend you to check it out."
4353,6868,First time flying from London City Airport and the overall experience was extremely impressive. Good shops available and spacious departures lounge.
4354,6871,Always works well. Everything is quick and simple. Not much room inside but best airport in the UK.
4355,6872,Very quick check-in if you are there early. Secrurity can be slow but generally quite a quick small airport. The main aeroplanes flying from this airport are Embraer E190s. Very steep angle of attack directly after take off and steep descent.
4356,6873,"Arriving at LCY is relatively easy. They may be doing some work, because the walk from entering the terminal building to the baggage claim hall looks a bit makeshift. I had no hold baggage, so walked straight out to the arrivals hall."
4357,6875,"Always quick, can get through the terminal from check in to aircraft in 5 minutes. They also have a new security scanner which means you dont need to take out liquids or laptops from luggage."
4358,6877,"Gatwick Express, very quick access to the airport, small airport, strange route to the gates, no OE sockets at the airport, adapter necessary"
4359,6878,"I’m a frequent traveller to Gatwick and it is where most of my holidays start, it was really nice And the customs were actually quick for once, it was so nice"
4360,6879,"Gatwick is a great airport with many easy access ways of transport, very helpful staff, a train station extremely close and easy to get to with trains up to London and Brighton and don’t forget there terminal shuttle going between the North and South Terminals"
4361,6880,Gatwick Airport is a great airport if you need assistance it is possible to book on the day if they not to busy! Load of food outlets to choose from .
4362,6881,The walk is to long that's why I flight in and out of LHR due to the transit that takes you to the different sections of the airport.
4363,6882,"The journey to the airport from Crawley was quick and easy. The railway station is well positioned. Security was not busy and I cleared in about 5 mins. However, LGW must have one of the longest and windiest route from security to the departure lounge through duty free of any airport that I have been in. Even after clearing duty free, it just seemed to be more shops. I wasn't looking in particular, but I only noticed one place to eat. Apart from the gates, there are not many spots to watch the aircraft movements. Although the South Terminal was relatively quiet, there were a lot of aircraft departing. So many that there was a huge backlog as aircraft queuing. The aircraft that I was on was held back at the gate due to the number of aircraft queuing to depart."
4364,6883,"Very nice airport. Busy but spacious. I loved the bridge under which aircraft were taxiing by, very nice views."
4365,6884,"Getting to Gatwick by rail is confusing, as options vary and traveling with luggage is a nightmare. LGW is NOT in London. The IAG automatic check in and bag drop was awesome and quick. Security was a mess, but nothing bad to complain about. Good shops, bad prices. Wifi for free (didn't try it). 30' delay on the ground."
4366,6885,"This is my normal airport I fly from, a busy airport with lots of duty free and many food places to eat. A lot of EasyJet fleet were there and really enjoyed seeing the sunrise in the morning of departure. As normal, security was fairly busy but flowing smoothly. Great experience as normal."
4367,6888,From the airport to the subway station --> long way. In the morning there was a long queue in front of immigration/customs --> lots of self-service machines
4368,6890,"Heathrow's Terminal 2 is marvelous and there's plenty of food options for vegans and vegetarians, but the Wi-Fi was a bit difficult to connect to. The washrooms were clean and were kept tidy and all times. The real highlight of this terminal was its marvelous wooden design."
4369,6891,"It was my first time in London Heathrow and must say, I am quit impressed with the efficiency of T5. I was supposed transfer from T5 to T2, and it was done in a matter of minutes, considering the large airport Heathrow is."
4370,6893,Overall it was an ok experience as there were some issues with the baggage handling for me and few other passengers. Immigration took a little bit of time but they had a few international flights coming in so it was ok.
4371,6894,Great airport with good history but needs more lounge access and a better check-in system. The shops were good though
4372,6895,"Once we got off the plane, we got through border control quickly but then the baggage sorters sent the bags to the wrong conveyor belt. That belt also had bags from the other arriving flight at the same time as us so we were wondering where our bags had gotten to and then it took ages to get them off a crowed conveyor"
4373,6896,"Lots of good amenities, and security was very good. However, the baggage handlers did break the handle on my suitcase in the hold."
4374,6897,"My passage through the airport was ok, the main downside was the long wait to get through security as very few lanes were open despite multiple security officers standing around with hands in pockets. Bathrooms were extremely dirt and the general facilities including restaurants were all completely full, despite it being a weekday at 6am. On my return the same day from Geneva the wait for the passport e gates was also extremely long as only half of the terminals were in use, and staff made no attempt to try and clear the backlog by assisting passengers that were going the wrong way they just stood about chatting instead."
4375,6899,"Train and transport is usually reliable, unless hits works or strikes Terminal has a habit of checking in people and keeping them on the stairs, until the plane is briefly cleaned, Lounges are fine, good to wait there the extra time"
4376,6900,"Great airport, flights to many destinations and not too busy! Check in wasn't so great, quite disorganised but apart from that really good."
4377,6902,Convenient airport. The passport control was quite quick and it was easy to exit the airport by foot
4378,6903,"Our flight was delayed by around an hour due to 'technical issues', but the rest of the airport experience was very nice"
4379,6905,"Security queue was very long, 25 minutes, with only 2 lanes open. Easy to navigate through the airport."
4380,6906,"Security queue was very long, 25 minutes, with only 2 lanes open. Easy to navigate through the airport."
4381,6907,An amazing little airport. Couldn't fault it at all! A good variety of shops and café plus the bar is good too!
4382,6908,On arrival there were three Customs desks manned the queue moved at reasonable pace. The staff were good. Although not the airports fault thereI wait about half an hour for taxi on this late arrival in the early hours of the next day as they had to arrange for an additional ones. Despite this I enjoy using my local airport.
4383,6909,Departed on Saturday afternoon in June. The queue at Security was quick & friendly. There were no trains running on this departure date with buses replacing them. Although there are only a few food & retail outs there is sufficient for an airport its size. Despite the delay I enjoy the using the my local airport.
4384,6910,"On arrival the queue at the customs desks moved quickly as five of the desks were staffed on this occasion. The member of staff I spoke to to on this occasion was very pleasant. Once I had cleared customs it was a short walk to get a taxi home. There are car hire , bus to Southend , Rayleigh , Chelmsford and Stansted Airport. There is a railway station for train services to Southend Victoria and London Liverpool Street. There are is a lot engineering work taking place on this railway line I would recommend finding out before you travel to allow sufficient time for your journey to and from this airport. Overall I enjoy using my local airport."
4385,6911,A lot busier if your are a passenger on one of the first departures in the morning between 6.30 - 7.30 you will need to arrive 2 hours before departure especially if you have a case to drop off. Although it was busy the queue moved relatively quickly through security. There are a few food and retail outlets but its sufficient for an airport of this size. Overall I still like using my local airport.
4386,6912,the new BGY_ SEN route and vice versa is nice for those going to and from London: By train from Stradfort in 45 minutes. and you are already at the airport where there are 15/20 flights a day. There are bars and restaurants but they are expensive. I hope the boarding gates for Ryanair are temporary: it is a corridor and it is not clear why the windows are at the bottom and do not allow you to see the runway and the aircraft.
4387,6913,"On arrival on this occasion four customs desks were manned this enabled the queue to move quickly. The baggage reclaim area is a short walk from the customs desks. There is a railway station for trains to London Liverpool Street and Southend Victoria railway station. At the moment during the weekend buses are the trains due to engineering work. There is a coach stop, car hire facilities and a taxi rank. I enjoy using my local airport."
4388,6914,This is a small airport but convenient and offers overall a good experience for departing passengers. There is a railway station but currently due to engineering work mainly at the weekend buses are replacing the trains. There is car park parking spaces and a coach service from Stansted to Southend Cleared security quickly . There are a few retail and food outlets but that's sufficient for an airport ofi its size. I enjoy using my local airport as usual.
4389,6915,On arrival at this airport despite only three customs desks being manned the que moved quickly. The customs staff are are friendly. Once you clear the customs it is a short distance the baggage carousels. For passengers wishing to travel to London there is a railway service to London Liverpool Street railway station a short walk across the road from the terminal building trains from here also go to Southend Victoria railway station. Also across the road from the terminal building there is a taxi rank staff ask passengers were they would like to travel to. There is coach stop for passengers wishing to use the hourly service to London Stansted Airport via Rayleigh and Chelmsford or to Southend. In terminal building there is a car hire company. There is a large number of parking spaces. Overall I enjoy using my local airport.
4390,6916,There is a lot of engineering work being undertaken at the weekend for passengers wishing to arrive by train however there are buses replacing the trains at weekends at the moment but the punctuality isn't as reliable . The terminal is compact cleared security within a few minutes the staff are very friendly. There are some shops and food outlets. A joy as ever to fly from.
4391,6917,Took ages to get through the security check as a bag got stuck in the x-ray thing. first time in about 10 trips to Stansted that we've actually been delayed going through the security check. Completely not the staff's fault as they couldn't really help it.
4392,6920,"This might actually be my best experience at Stansted so far. The security check was a new machine that I did not have to take out my laptop for, though I did out of habit."
4393,6923,Getting to the airport from the north Via public transport is a pain. You have to go via the expensive London. Check-in/security was pretty standard but I had no problem. Once through security the airport is supprisingly nice. Very modern and has a decent range of food. The Wifi was very fast and allowed me to get plenty of work done.
4394,6924,Getting in via the airport bus was simple we didn't do check-in as we had carry on's. Security was quick as we were put on trail on their new system. But the lounge was completely full to the brim so we never got the chance to review it.
4395,6925,"Good places to eat, drink or shop before your holiday or flight out. Though seating is limited at parts of the airport."
4396,6926,"Getting to the airport was nice, so 5 stars, but it was an hour to go there Check in was a bit long so honestly 4 stars. Security check is all fine, just the queue is long, 4 stars Terminal facilities are nice, i dont remember alot. Food and retail? No, i just brang my own lunch ( I dont know alot of words. ) WiFi works good. Lounge? Ehmmm, i dont really know but no comfortable seats"
4397,6927,Aspire lounge is recommended for priority pass members. Nice food & easy going before going to your flight.
4398,6928,Friendly staff Check-in wasn't busy (05:00) Security wasn't busy (Around 07:00) Wifi was average Shops and food was alright
4399,6929,"the security can get a little crowded at peak times and did slow us down about half an hour. we were not late for our flight at all, we had another hour prior when we got to our gate but we don't like to be held up in some places for a long time."
4400,6930,Baggage got lost for about 20 minutes before they found it. Great airport but I would say check your ground handlers.
4401,6931,"Bulky baggage appears on the normal carousel as everything else and doesn't get dumped in some weird location. The airport isn't looking great at arrivals, but the system works."
4402,6933,"Airport itself is lovely, but staff handling flights to NORTHERN Ireland treat passengers like second class citizens, forgetting we too are British citizens"
4403,6934,"Manchester Terminal 2is on the up. But from arrival gate, through boarder control and onto baggage collection is well in excess of 500m. Not ideal when travellators aren't operational. Plus, onward car travel pick-up is a pain to find, especially if you've a fair bit of luggage. And at £6 collection fees is a bit of a rip off seeing other international airports are fairly straight forward for non-driving passenger collections."
4404,6935,"I had given myself plenty of time between arrival and the onward train that I had booked. I'd come off of a small aircraft, but ended up in a large queue for immigration. The queue moved reasonably quickly though. MAN has many transport options and they are relatively central to the terminals."
4405,6937,"Very efficient, through security in about 2 minutes. Very hard to find seating in the departures after security when there are many flights."
4406,6938,"Lovely small airport with everything you need, however a more regular bus service would be better as there was over a 70 minute wait for the next bus departure."
4407,6939,"Security was very fast at the airport, from Check in to Landside I was their less than 5 minutes, Check in staff and airport staff on the whole was fantastic, lovely airport. Sure Will use Newquay again in the future. the airport might be small, but suitable size for the amount of flights operating at the moment."
4408,6941,"It is a nice and quiet little airport, our flight was cancelled due to the storm. Very helpfull staff"
4409,6942,Years since I flew via Newquay and it's changed beyond recognition. Facilities basically good for the number of flights handled.
4410,6943,Years since I flew via Newquay and it's changed beyond recognition. Facilities basically good for the number of flights handled.
4411,6944,Years since I flew via Newquay and it's changed beyond recognition. Facilities basically good for the number of flights handled.
4412,6945,"This was the first time I have flown out of Newquay Cornwall Airport. And to be fair this was probably the best experience I have had amongst the previous journeys. Even though the airport is a bit small, and doesn't have that amount of facilities that you might expect. It was still a great experience. Security check was fast and efficient, the waiting area just before boarding is comfortable and big enough for the amount of passengers that might want to leave with next flight out of Cornwall. WiFi is great, and it really is super-fast, so you won't have any issues streaming fullHD YouTube videos. Or even if needed to upload them to your server. All in all it was a great experience"
4413,6946,"A basic regional airport which struggles to attract passengers and, considering the Flybe routes to London are PSA routes, they charge surprisingly high fairs. The security lane is unable to cope well and despite having more staff than normal, they manage to make it really really slow. The departure lounge is basic and not really big enough for 2 flights at a time."
4414,6947,Arriving at OBN is simple. Baggage claim consists of collecting the bag from the pilot as he pulls it from the hold. There is a bus to Oban which picks up at the airport and arrived not long after I had left the terminal.
4415,6948,This is a tiny airport serving the local and island communities. There is plenty of seating for the number of passengers that the plane can carry. Check in is easy with no queues and security is similarly straightforward.
4416,6949,"Nice little airport, excellent views across to the island of mull. great hospitality by the airport staff. quick checkin then 10mins later sitting on the plane."
4417,6950,This airport is great because of the speed of service. You get through everything insanely quickly and the staff were soo nice!
4418,6951,"When we went, there were only around 3 stores open and there were none near check in. All at duty free and stuff."
4419,6953,"My local and favourite airport, have flown through here seamlessly many times. Even when I had a flight that was transferred to Stansted the staff were most helpful and tried to keep us all updated often. Great shopping facilities/cafes for a small airport, including a seating area landside with views over the terminal ramp. Only slight drawback is the £10 development fee, but all funds go to the upkeep of the airport. Good spotting locations too for plane spotters."
4420,6954,"My local and favourite airport, have flown through here seamlessly many times.

4426,6960,ONLY THING BAD WAS DUE TO STORM CIARAN HEAVY RAIN ONCE WE LANDED MEANT WE GOT SOAKED AND NO JETBRIDHGES MENAT WET FDEET ON WALK AND BAD WELCOME BACK HOME
4427,6962,"Getting to the airport for me is easy and has decent facilaties for a regional airport. I had to check oversized luggage, and as usual with ryanair the queue was very long. Otherwise aiport was clean, but sturggled with the free wifi and didn't pay for the higher level"
4428,6963,Not very good shops and réassurants shut at about 19:30 or 20:30 not best if your flight is delayed but other than that ok not many aircraft and very good customer service very kind staff
4429,6965,EMA is a regional airport serving several cities and it is probably equidistance from all of them. Therein lies the problem. Travel time between any of these cities and the airport seems to be length journey.
4430,6967,"The experience of flying from East Midlands Airport was very good, will certainly fly from there again."
4431,6970,"Although Brize Norton is a Royal Air Force aerodrome, it deserves it's place on FR 24 as it is always prepared to receive aircraft in an emergency, could also be used as an MDA for most of the big airports"
4432,6974,Does the job the RAF need.
4433,6977,"The airport is very small and a little cramped, but I live in Southampton so it’s perfect for me."
4434,6978,"A great airport to use, check in is always swift as is security. There is a good sized duty free area after security with a Costa Coffee outlet on the first floor - this overlooks the ramp area. The bar has no views. Free wi-fi is available & had a good speed."
4435,6979,The Business lounge is shut except at weekends apparently.a result of covid. Annoying as have over an hour to kill and would prefer somewhere comfortable to sit and work. Cafes busy but not overcrowded. There are seats and screaming kids aplenty. Bloke on reception was very pleasant. Rapid train from centre of Southampton and short walk to the airport.
4436,6980,Very easy to get to and very quick to check in and get through security but not many facilities once through security
4437,6981,"There is a ten minute train journey or a 40 odd minute bus journey from the city centre to the airport. I arrived at the airport just after check-in opened and walked straight through to the counter. There was no queue at security either. My bag was diverted for checking, but it didn't take too long and the staff were friendly. Landside, only the shop was open. Airside only the bar resturant was openThe departure lounge was large enought to easily accomodate all of the passengers in the lounge. A really good airport to travel from. Compact and not too busy."
4438,6982,My hold baggage arrived on the carousel just slightly after I arrived at it. It was only a few minutes from getting off the aircraft to arriving in the main arrivals hall.
4439,6983,"SOU is a small airport, but there were a few other flights leaving around the same time as mine, however, security very quick to get through. Most of the retail and food outlets were closed when I was there. The departure lounge is small, but I there was plenty of available seats."
4440,6984,"Southampton is served by buses services to the town centre and, with a short walk, ferry terminal. I don't think that there are any express buses, so the journey does take a little longer than I would have expected. Being small with few flights, there was no delay in transferring from the aircraft to the landside."
4441,6985,"This was between first and second lock down in UK and the airport was running very few flights, so most of the services were unfortunately closed"
4442,6986,Arrival at SOU was fine. The baggage was in the terminal about the same time as the passengers. Buses to town are frequent and available just outside the terminal building.
4443,6991,"Recently refurbished. Security was great, new scanners mean no removal of liquids or laptops etc. Terminal refurb is really good, resembles more of a waiting lounge than an airport terminal. Could get really busy with a few big aircraft"
4444,6992,"Very basic but comfortable, clean and well maintained. One security gate with minimal queue as there are so few flights. One shop and one bar open on the airside. Plenty of seating with good views out across the apron."
4445,6993,Teesside is a lovely little airport with really friendly staff Was under redevelopment when I went
4446,6994,Small but pleasant airport
4447,7001,Small but pretty and clean airport! Looks like a museum and is well-structured. Very friendly staff!
4448,7002,"I like ALB because it's close and convenient. Lines are usually quick which I appreciate. Only downside is that the restaurants tend to close a bit early, so if you have a late flight, you may not be able dine in the terminal. The restaurants themselves are nice however."
4449,7003,"The airport was beautiful, there was no lounges but it made up for it with the nice seats by the gate and the restaurants they had."
4450,7004,"Great small airport, parking, checking in, security, and boarding was all straight forward with no problems."
4451,7005,"Two letters EZ. At 6 in the morning the airport is bustling with travelers bound for cities throughout the Northeast, no line or traffic to airport, nice new road, easy signage, fast and efficient security, easy boarding. Truely solid regional airport"
4452,7008,Good value
4453,7009,"The airport is definitely more of a cozy home type of airport and is really nice because of that! What makes it three stars though? Security is horribly rude for absolutely no reason. The second to last time I visited the airport, two guys were bullying a passenger for not completely understanding the process (he's not a frequent traveler). Overall, it's a beautiful airport with extraordinarily rude security with the lack of a reason, and a good one at that. Oh yeah, let's not forget the single guy that owns most every food or drink business in the airport, and still doesn't ""allow"" competition."
4454,7010,The airport itself is very easy to navigate and well maintained. The rental car arrangement is a giant pain.
4455,7011,"Getting to the airport was easy enough even though it is a bit outside of the city. Check-in was easy even though one of the people in our group had trouble with the kiosks. The security check was incredibly fast. Terminal facilities were fine and clean. The seating areas are plentiful and very comfortable. Wifi was a bit slow but adequate, a little difficult to log in. Food options were good but way too expensive even for airport prices. Retail was the standard but had some nice local options."
4456,7012,"Easy to navigate, and plenty of places to sit down or rearrange your items. Getting to the airport is fine but getting to the rental car pickup involves taking a shuttle and it's a bit of an inconvenience. Wifi is adequate but slow and a little difficult to log in to."
4457,7013,"Hard to not like the ABQ Sunport! I find flying to or from here is easy and convenient. All staff I encounter is extremely friendly and accommodation. Not to mention, I just love the southwestern/New Mexican style architecture of the terminal building."
4458,7014,"Have to say for a small airport it's definitely one of the nicer ones es for its age. Getting through security is easy, parking is plentiful and the restrooms are realy clean! There is a good microbrewery (once you get through security) once you get to the point to the point that you have to select which terminal you are boarding."
4459,7015,"Awesome facility with the southwestern feel and architecture. I really enjoyed the public observation deck, great views of the mountains, they just need my aircraft movements."
4460,7016,"Great airport... Arrived late and Delta misplaced luggage. Handled quickly by Delta rep and suitcase arrived at hotel a few hours later. Free wifi, no problem at all getting a taxi at 9 PM. Shops and restaurants seemed to be closed. Departure--- about $20 for a taxi from near Old Town, check-in and security fast. Plenty of outlets to charge electronic devices. A few restaurants and shops... $3.19 for a bottle of Coke at the news stand seems criminal though."
4461,7017,"One of my favorite airports. Laid back and easy to navigate. Now that the Wright amendment is gone, I will be here less, but did enjoy the quick layovers on WN with a Kiva juice ready to go to California or back to DAL."
4462,7024,"It's your average mid market airport nothing special, but it has a McDonalds. It has good views though"
4463,7025,Good airport to fly in and fly out of. Even has a place to just watch the planes from a climate controlled space.
4464,7026,"The Anchorage Airport is beautiful. It has lots of daylight and beautiful views of the mountains. It has plenty of cargo activity, so there are some large, fascinating airplanes passing through the airport. My one complaint is the WiFi and phone service in the building. While it is easy to join the WiFi network, it can be extremely sluggish at times. Hotspotting off a phone doesn't always work very well either since there are some weak service areas in the airport."
4465,7027,"ANC is a cool little airport that I’d love to explore more in the future. Lots of art installations that range from gorgeous to quirky, great tarmac views, solid food options and even a pop-up Delta Sky Club! Loved the window decals all over giving interesting facts about the airport — had no idea it was 4th busiest for cargo in the US!"
4466,7028,"Ted Stevens is truly an airport like no other. Forget the hassle, the lines, and the crowds. PANC has none of that. Love this airport."
4467,7029,"We enjoyed the experience at the airport. The WiFi is free and it's really needed, as in Alaska only GCI showed on my phone and had no data coverage. All the staff was friendly and the experience was smooth. One minus is that the exit ramp from the car rentals is really poorly designed, a slightly longer car barely fits through there."
4468,7030,"Surprisingly good airport. Realize that this used to be the gateway to Asia in the days before modern jetliners with 10,000 miles of range but was pleasantly surprised to find a modern facility."
4469,7031,Anchorage was amazing! beautiful mountains and snow in June! But it was quite odd to be in totally different side of the world after such a long trip. And it was pretty weird cuz everybody was speaking in english and I didnt knew anyone at all there!
4470,7033,Very aesthetically pleasing airport. Really pretty interior and easy to navigate. In terms of food/retail there isn't any besides a plethora of vending machines at least airside. Staff was very friendly. Would absolutely fly here again! Also had good Wi-Fi
4471,7035,"First time ever flying into this airport. Loved the opportunity to see my home from the plane on our way in. It's a very small regional airport, but it is convenient. The bar is very nice, and worth checking out if you are coming through when it is open."
4472,7038,"ATL is obviously a DL hub, so other airlines often end up with gates that are, sub-par. AS is no exception, being allocated gate D3 at the end of DLs regional concourse alongside Frontier and Spirit. The gate area is extremely small and congested. Definitely no need to show up early and wait - you'll thank yourself later. Check-in was just chaos for seemingly no reason - AS and their new bag check/tag machines are not fast and they cause lots of confusion and the line was very long."
4473,7039,"Massive airport that you should allow at least 45 minutes to connect through, because Delta runs the whole show and while there's some predictability about which gate you'll get into/leave from, things can change. Some great Delta lounges, some mediocre ones."
4474,7042,"Atlanta's terminals are starting to show their age--they feel worn down and cramped. However, the TSA pre-check line was well-organized and efficient, and the Delta Lounge in the A gates was very spacious and well-stocked."
4475,7043,"Loved all the shopping and dining options, and how modern and clean ATL looked, but literally had the worst customs/TSA experience ever here"
4476,7044,"Loved all the shopping and dining options, and how modern and clean ATL looked, but literally had the worst customs/TSA experience ever here"
4477,7046,"Loved all the shopping and dining options, and how modern and clean ATL looked, but literally had the worst customs/TSA experience ever here"
4478,7047,"The best airport if you are in transfer, max 10 minutes to get from any terminal to any other, fantastic :-))))"
4479,7053,Small airport but check in and going through security is a breeze. Usually it's not very crowded and plenty of seats are available.
4480,7054,Small airport but check in and going through security is a breeze. Usually it's not very crowded and plenty of seats are available.
4481,7055,Small airport but check in and going through security is a breeze. Usually it's not very crowded and plenty of seats are available.
4482,7056,Small airport but check in and going through security is a breeze. Usually it's not very crowded and plenty of seats are available.
4483,7057,Super small and brand new. Security lines are either small or empty.
4484,7059,The security line is really fast and there are decent food options not too far from wherever you may be in the airport. Good public transit access.
4485,7060,"its crusty, dirty, and overall represents baltimore very well. Baggage claim SUCKS, I had to wait 1 hour+ for my bag Nice mcdonalds tho"
4486,7061,I love this airport because of the big windows that let you look to everything that is happening outside. Take your time to wander around and explore. There are also things to see even though you are not flying.
4487,7062,"Getting Through Airport: Nice, and easy, but crowded due to midday rush Check-In: No check-in! Connecting flight :) Security: No security, connecting flight :) Terminals: Decorated, nice and spacious, got rid of the rocking chairs by the windows though :( But it is easy to navigate :) WiFi: WiFi was smooth but lagged in between times Food and Retail: Plenty of choices with quick and easy service Lounge: No lounges :( But seating area is nice :)"
4488,7063,"Getting Around Airport: Easy with the walkways and signs, it is a cool airport to walk through and has LONG Terminals Terminals: They were nice and clean, had art on the wall and had shops around every corner, as well as Southwest planes :) WiFi: WiFi was quick and smooth but froze in between times Food/Retail: Food was great, had lots of options Lounge: No lounge that I could find :( Immigration/Customs: Stayed in America. No Customs :) Baggage Claim: connecting flight. No baggage claim :) Overall a nice time"
4489,7064,"Immigration was ok but the queue went slow, all 15-20 foreigners had to go through one officer; they've periodically halt the queue to let the US citizens pass, despite there were several other queues solely for them"
4490,7065,"A bit difficult to get to from DC, but other than that a great experience. My usual way from DC is Metrorail -> MARC Penn line to BWI station -> Shuttle bus to BWI. I think the food and retail services here could be a bit better."
4491,7066,"BWI to me is ""an"" airport. I wouldn't recommend a connection here longer than 3 hours as you will be bored out of your mind wandering back and forth through the endless halls of southwest gates with the only distinguishing feature telling you if you are in Concourse A or B being if you passed the Coffee Shop or Jamba Juice. With that being said, there are some nice views and comfortable areas to chill out while waiting for your flight. There are more than enough food options, including multiple full sitdown restaurants, which I did not try, but they did smell very good. All in all, BWI is an airport I try to spend a minimal amount of time in, but if i am stuck here, its not the worst thing in the world."
4492,7067,"Very nice terminal and services, sadly several food venders were closed or were very slow. We had to wait over half an hour on the ground for our gate to open up, and what was supposed to be a 1-hour layover turned into a 10-minute mad dash to catch my connection. Luckily it was delayed too. Delays were due to slow ground handling (according to the WN crew)"
4493,7068,"It always feels to me like Southwest, more so than any other major US carrier, packs as many people as can uncomfortably fit into its hub airports/terminals."
4494,7070,"Again, TSA is not customer friendly. They actually treat us as if we are an inconvenience. This attitude starts at the top, so maybe they need new leadership in the sector. Baggage claim equipment is good. Alaska personnel are slow."
4495,7071,"BLI is a small airport and easy to travel out of whether you are a US Citizen or from Canada. I, like most people, don't like being treated like dumb cattle by the Thousands Standing Around people. They need to grow a smile. You can still have good security and not be a unpleasant."
4496,7072,"Great little airport with cheap onsite parking. Security is a breeze, terrific restaurant and bar, free wi-fi. While crowded at times, it's still easy enough to get through the masses in record time. Construction is complete, and it's become my favorite airport to travel in and out of."
4497,7074,Small airport. They were doing expansion when I was there.
4498,7075,"Very nice staff, but very old fashioned facilities"
4499,7076,"Incredible airport. Very well set up, nicely organized, open layout with great ramp views. Absolutely amazing."
4500,7077,"Pretty good little regional airport. 17 gates with hub service on regional jets by UA, AA, and DL. Also A320 service on Allegiant to a couple of holiday destinations. The usual rental car counters (most lacking express service like National Emerald Aisle), two bag claim carousels with reasonably speedy service, a few restaurants and the obligatory public art and advertisements for local attractions. Pretty much what you'd expect from a regional airport."
4501,7078,Awesome airport. Love spotting and traveling here. Sports charters sometimes and great facilities. 5 out of 5
4502,7079,"This is a fairly new airport, very clean. Still has that ""new airport"" smell. Parking options need work but they're getting better (parking deck under construction). Food options limited but decent. Wifi works well enough to be useful. Clean."
4503,7080,"NICE AIRPORT,GOOD FOOD."
4504,7081,Kinda cool and Spiacoys like a mall I would recommend for anyone visiting Alabama or is moving to alabama
4505,7082,"I was the only person at the security line, which was really nice -- there's not a whole lot going on once you get past the checkpoint, but it's a nice, modern-looking facility"
4506,7083,"Very fast security, it was not crowded at all. Maybe the nicest security I’ve ever interacted with. Everything was open that would be that time of day. I was very satisfied with the airport in BHM."
4507,7084,Birmingham Airport is a little airport wedged in between a set of small mountains that is perfect for commerce.
4508,7085,Much improved post-renovations. Actually more than tolerable now!
4509,7090,I love this airport. It’s not too big so the time from baggage drop to the gate takes very little time. Security is quick and easy. Best of all the TSA agents are generally all really nice and down to earth. Plenty of food options and wifi is super fast. It’s a low key place that operates with big airport efficiency.
4510,7091,"Smaller airport but very nice, clean, well kept and easy to get from check-in to the gate. I really enjoy traveling in/out of Boise Gowen Fld."
4511,7092,"Boise Airport is small, easy to navigate and spacious enough for the size of crowds transiting this facility. No large planes coming/going... all 737 / A320's and smaller commuter jets and turbo props, like Horizon Air."
4512,7093,"Easy to navigate as it is a very small airport. The rental car return location was within a walking distance of the terminal so it made convenient to get to the airport. Great airport to fly out of, food is a little less as you only have 2-3 selections to choose from but overall a nice little airport."
4513,7094,"I am local to this airport, so I don't really stay there for very long, but in my stay there, I have found a nice terminal with some food options, and I don't really get why you can polish your shoes there. Nice airport in general, can't wait to see an expansion!"
4514,7096,"PRICES ARE RIGHT, OLD AIRPORT BUT NICE WELL KEPT."
4515,7097,"The new Delta lounge in Terminal E is one of the best lounges I've ever been to. Great views of Boston, huge space with high ceilings, private spaces, and showers."
4516,7098,"Review is limited to Terminal A. Haven't flown through this terminal in over a decade but it remains a very modern airport terminal with spacious seating, windows overlook tarmac and easy directions. Arrival was at the A12-A21 concourse which is accessible via a long underground walkway beneath the tarmac. Departure was from main terminal concourse. Plenty of dining options at both concourses. Terminal was very busy given the snowstorm and delayed flights. WiFi was easy to log onto and fast. Kudos to Logan airport snow clearing crews and the crews de-icing planes. Our flight to DFW was delayed but we managed to take off. Throughout the storm planes kept taking off and landing."
4517,7099,"Upon arrival we had to grab our bags, go to a different building (go outside first) and through strange hallways, we got to the JetBlue area, where we had to re-check the bags and go through security again. We had 50 minutes between arrival and the doors closing for the next flight. Luckily we had Global Entry."
4518,7100,"Compared to JFK which I flew put of in July, Boston terminal C was so much better in terms of security check. It literally took me a maximum of 5 mins to get through with no queues. However, there was quite a trek to get to the main duty-free areas from the gates and there wasn't many facilities."
4519,7101,"I have been to Boston Logan Airport many times, normally to watch planes. But I don’t go to Logan Airport to fly a plane often. The airport is easy to get to with easy to understand signage on the road. I like this airport! Keep up the good work!"
4520,7103,"First time traveling through Terminal B since its refurbishment. Once you clear security, one enters a new Great Hall with 75,000 sq feet of new space and 70,000 sq feet of existing space. All gates connect post security. The refurbished space is a world class modern airport terminal. It is spacious, brightly lit with plenty of seating and dining options aplenty. There are oodles of power ports and USB ports in the dining area. Bathrooms have occupancy lights and were generally clean for the most part. WiFi connectivity was okay. The concourses are wide and directions easy to follow. However the area near my departure gate was rather narrow and very crowded"
4521,7104,Boston Logan is an ok airport and is sort of easy to navigate. They have an extremely long wait time in customs so if you have a short layover you are screwed.
4522,7105,"Always a pleasure traveling through Logan - the only down side is the fact that immigration lines are always long - at least an hour! but the staff handle it well and as a positive, your checked bags are always waiting for you by the time you get through!"
4523,7106,"Boston Logan Airport is Probably One of the Best Airports on the East Coast, perfectly placed in Boston and accessible by Public Transport"
4524,7107,"Very pretty, western/log cabin feel with lots of warm woods, carpet, and local art. Smaller regional airport with two terminals/12 gates. No lounges but a couple of restaurant/bars and gift shops. TSA only has 4 lanes and can take a while when it's busy."
4525,7108,"Beautiful, small, modern airport, Western decor. Rental garage attached to terminal, super easy to get out and in, fast TSA. A++"
4526,7109,"Very friendly people and very lovely airport, though short time staying here and believe that we will be here again when go to Yellowstone then. Hope that everything could remain after decades of years, love this airport so much."
4527,7111,"Did not spend much time here but overall it was pretty good. Also, WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY does this have to be 100 characters long?"
4528,7112,"Overall good facilities, a very nice modern feel and great views of aircraft parked at the terminal. There are plenty of food options for travelers waiting for a departing flight, and lines are very short if you arrive early for your flight. I arrived about an hour and a half early for my flight and there was literally no line for TSA or most food options, with the exception being Tim Hortons, which had a short line that quickly grew into a line long enough to deter most other passengers from getting coffee. All in all, I love flying out of Buffalo and have no real complaints about this wonderful airport."
4529,7113,"They stopped selling the Intense Milk chocolate milk, quite upset. other than that, the experience was great, and if you get there early, most people are checking bags so you can slide through security very easily."
4530,7114,Very well run airport with wide concourses and lots of seating. Plus they have the original buffalo wing.
4531,7115,"Easy terminal to navigate, current amenities are sufficient for an airport of this size but could definitely use a refresh (seating, flooring, walls, lighting, etc)... The new lounge is a welcome addition, albeit somewhat hindering if you're apart of any airline rewards program with lounge access, as this lounge is not compatible with any membership but has its own program..."
4532,7116,"Very little information was provided on delayed and cancelled flights on screens. If you didn't hear announcement, it was very difficult to get more information. On screen was only indicated delay, but no time whatsoever. On screen at the gate were commercials, but no information on flight or delay."
4533,7117,"Getting to the airport was OK, nice NFTA bus service from downtown (line 24), very efficient and for just $2. Check-in machine was not reading my passport and do not accept my reservation number, but check-in at the counter was very fast and efficient with a big added smile. Good points for the Delta. Security is bad at Buffalo, I have not been selected for TSA-Pre (unlike on JFK two days before) and went through normal procedure. Even worse, this was my second time departing from BUF and again a special precautions have been applied to me. But finally everything was OK. 45' complimentary Wi-Fi worked OK and is more than enough for waiting at such small, familiar and straightforward airport."
4534,7118,Wonderful airport!! Very friendly staff!! Helped me find the Anchor Bar had the best chicken wings ever!! This airport was very clean and easy to navigate!! Two thumbs up for Buffalo!! Will be happy to get back here again soon!!!!!
4535,7121,1st time to Burbank and i loved it. i love small airports like this. where the taxi from runway to gate when laning is less than a minute and the taxi from take gate to runway on take-off is less than 5 minutes and also this is mostly a turn an burn airport on take off. where they do not even stop when the get to the end off the runway they just turn around a start the take off roll. not even bother to stop.
4536,7122,"Absolutely love everything about Burbank, just wish there was more food options within the terminals."
4537,7123,Friendly staff and a very easy to maneuver airport that is people friendly. My only discrepancy against BUR is I wish there was more food options.
4538,7124,"Easy and convenient LA area airport with plenty of carries offering great non-stop or one-stop destinations. Food and retail options leave something to be desired, but there is a renovation coming sometime soon."
4539,7125,"I have wanted to fly out of this airport for years and finally got the chance and it lived up to the hype, somewhat. I will get the negative out of the way first and say the interior is outdated. That is my only complaint. It is clean, the staff was extremely helpful and friendly and the airport is very easy to navigate. Parking was not an issue at all as well. It also has a surprisingly wide array of food options for how small it is."
4540,7126,Tiny Airport. Super easy. Smooth security. Only complaint is the painfully expensive concessions/restaurants.
4541,7127,"Good little airport very convenient, but more expensive to fly out of. It's cool the terminal is right next to the runway. The terminal has the small town feel due to its size, parking is easy compared to LAX, but it's limited on the size of aircraft that can land so you most likely won't see anything bigger than a 737 there."
4542,7129,Great views of landing aircraft onto runway 8 from Viineland Ave. See http://www.panoramio.com/photo/54446968
4543,7130,Small and with free WiFi
4544,7135,"Very few food options, the one bar charged $0.85 for tap water which I think is actually illegal in the United States. The food was extremely overpriced and bad. There was no lounge option and the wifi was spotty. They are building an extension so hopefully that will give better retail and food options"
4545,7136,"It is what a regional airport should be. Up to date facilities. Walk to/from car rental lots. Strong WiFi. During peak times, TSA should have a dedicated ID checker for PREV customers."
4546,7137,Small airport so not a lot of food options. The one sports bar is nice and the whole place is super clean. Never a long line to get through security.
4547,7138,"The Cedar Rapids Airport, is a friendly airport, that makes its flyers feel at home. It features many lounges and includes multiple charging stations all around. This airport serves its guest by having a couple of resturants scattered around the area, while maintaining speed during chek-in / TSA / Boarding & Deplaning. I deffinetly recomend the Eastern Iowa Airport."
4548,7139,ULTRA quick through security.
4549,7140,Great airport to transfer through. Both concourses at CHS are connected via a post-security walk-way. Was able to check in for my next flight at the desk at the gate instead of having to re-clear security.
4550,7141,Charleston was a really cool airport to visit since Boeing has a factory on the airport. Our flight was delayed and the airport shuts down at around 6pm.
4551,7142,I was pretty impressed at CHS. Very clean and open; lots of natural light. TSA was quick and friendly. Decent dining options.
4552,7143,"Charleston airport is nice and quaint. Not too busy, very walkable with fine restaurant choice, and great views inside and outside the terminal!!"
4553,7145,"Lots of noisy reconstrution wotk at the moment , hire car parking is an uphill walk to the terminal . Best coffee is before TSA . Would be interesting to see after the work is compleated .Plenty of staff are doing good work despite the rebuilding ."
4554,7147,"Overall a nice airport, but generally overcrowded often for as tight as the gates are at the end of B & C gates. Large lounge between C & D, but is packed often making the lounge worthless."
4555,7148,"Short transfer and it was a breeze, seemed a well thought out airport. Would happily travel through it again."
4556,7149,"Fairly cramped main terminal area, even in the American areas, which is surprising for a hub. The Centurion Lounge is nice, though limited for space, which resulted in a roughly 30-minute wait."
4557,7150,"Clean, great food options and easy to navigate. This is probably the best airport in the Southeastern USA"
4558,7151,Lot of construction at entrance and ticketing. Security checkpoint is a little overwhelming. Give yourself extra time. One inside terminals it was all good.
4559,7152,"Charlotte Airport is quite interesting, it's infested with American jets and clean, and it has nice waiting zones for your airplane."
4560,7153,Easy to navigate airport if it is your departure/destination airport with lots of construction going on to help expand the airport. The free WiFi in The Club CLT and in the general terminal worked well.
4561,7154,Poor Public transport to the airport but traffic is normally not that bad. Check in and security can range from 5-15ms depending on various factors. Terminal is okay. AA lounge is good by American Airlines standards and has an airport view.
4562,7157,"Wonderful entrance into the system, TSA easy, great wifi and bar/restaurant, parking a bit expensive, phone/computer charging stations everywhere"
4563,7158,Flew my discovery flight out of here and the taxiways were very smooth and we felt small against the crj-200s. XD
4564,7159,They have redone the airport and the bar is bigger and there is tons of working space with outlets everywhere. They did a great job.
4565,7160,slow luggage
4566,7161,Had an observation area and clean restrooms. UVA themed.
4567,7162,The modernization of CHA makes it look a lot cleaner and nicer. The staff is still as friendly as always and it is easy to navigate.
4568,7163,Very clean and a very nice quaint little airport with friendly staff. The only issue is the food option is a little underwhelming with only three places to eat i believe which is acceptable for such a small airport.
4569,7164,"Small and very easy to navigate, took about 10 minutes from checkin to getting to my gate. Few small shops and eateries on airside. TSA was very quick. Staff was nice. Only complaint is it was a bit outdated."
4570,7165,"I always love flying through MDW. Very passenger-friendly. A lot of the concessions spots have been revamped to really nice, delicious places. Always enjoy going through."
4571,7166,Dropped from auto rental transport on ground floor and necessary to get to 3rd floor for departure ticketing then down to 2nd level for security and departure gates. New equipment at security and no need to remove shoes or computers from carry on…nice!
4572,7169,"Security is long and a lot of traffic getting there. Overall, good airport for the Chicago area and a better smaller option than O'hare."
4573,7170,"MDW is the better of the Chicago airports speaking strictly from a passenger standpoint. Security lines quick enough, not too crowded, solid enough concessions, easy to get around. Should be the baseline for airports of similar size."
4574,7171,"KMDW is among my favorite airports to use as a passenger. Shortest security lines I've ever seen on a consistent basis, and the new TSA checkpoint upgrade will help. Has a small/cozy enough feel, plenty of quality places to eat."
4575,7172,"Baggage claim was loud due to construction, but it is a positive that they are redesigning the older parts of Midway"
4576,7173,MDW desperately needs some new airlines to fly here. Good move by Volaris and Delta to stay faithful to the airport and not completely move all their flights to ORD.
4577,7174,"An older airport, Midway is still well maintained. It does have decent food and drink options, though many are closed for the pandemic still. Bathrooms are small and feel like those of a middle school, but they work. Fair amount of seating at the gates but again doesn't feel like it presently with many unavailable for social distancing. Overall, it's a decent airport still and great for plane watching, which I truly appreciate."
4578,7176,"I have TSA precheck and my dad drives me to the airport, but it was still smooth sailing at ORD. But did you really fly through ORD if you didn't get dropped off at the wrong side of the airport?"
4579,7177,"The line for customs was long but moved fast enough. The baggage claim wait took a while, over 45 minutes for the bags to come out. But other than that it was OK."
4580,7178,"Delta moving to the International Terminal is a major improvement; Delta used to be tucked in the worst corner of the airport. The new SkyClub at ORD, accordingly, is lovely; it's huge, has multiple buffets, and a Chicago hot dog cart!"
4581,7179,"This was my 2nd time flying out of O’Hare, it was a very nice airport and easy to find our terminal. I recommend arriving 1-2 hours before you flight since as it’s an international airport security can be long. But for us security was quick, if you have kids I recommend flying over night ( like I did ) as it can help pass the time instead of having a kid confined to a seat for 8 hours."
4582,7181,"O'hare is a great airport, and even though it's massive, the facilities are still decently clean, especially in the new terminals."
4583,7182,"I got to take the Terminal C to B tunnel, which is always a fun experience at ORD. As always, lots of retail and decently clean."
4584,7183,"Great airport for transit passengers. There are food options that suits everyone in Terminal 5. The security checking was great, but make sure to be on time as the lines get pretty long."
4585,7184,"As a Canadian, I thought the airports in the USA were terrible and old, but O'Hare blew me away. The architecture, the music and food were so great. If you make a transit in the US from an international trip, choose O'Hare over JFK."
4586,7185,"They do have wifi, but access it you have to put in your name, email, and postcode. I would recommend getting wifi from some of the restaurants."
4587,7186,"Getting To Airport: Traffic was light but quick and easy to get there. Check-In: Check-In went smooth and fast, agents were helpful and kind Security: Security went by fast considering it was a morning flight but TSA agents were nice and easy Terminals: Terminal was easy to navigate and clean. It was not crowded and had plenty of things around WiFi: WiFi ran smooth but had some lags in between :/ Food/Retail: Plenty of options however most were closed :( Lounge: No lounge that I could find :("
4588,7189,"No seperate , fast track for business travelers is biggest disadvantage of CVG. Food services could be better."
4589,7190,"So I flew in, and came back. Getting there was fairly easy, but it was not directly there like I came from BWI. The Terminal can be a bit Empty, but are very nice, Empty because Delta owns a whole Terminal, but has slowly stopped using it as much. Food is good and fast. WiFi is decent. Overall a pretty good airport, 4/5. Theres also an automatic train to get you from one place to the next within the airport."
4590,7191,"Near-complete lack of public transportation from dowtown Cincinnati is just totally inappropriate these days. Otherwise very nice, clean and enjoyable regional airport with the right level of services."
4591,7192,"Pretty empty, small enough to navigate. Wait times are pretty low, 10 mins or so. Still options for shopping, and eating. Only airport domestically whose tram isn't on wheels, which makes it fast, and more smooth."
4592,7193,"Nice airport, easy to get around."
4593,7194,I wouldn't say this place needs updating at all... It is one of the nicest Airports I have ever flown to. What it needs is more contracts with airlines
4594,7195,"Needs some improvements. Easy to navigate. Various food options, but wish there were more amenities. The concourse hallways are small and aging. Security is tight unless you have PreCheck, and even then the majority of people don't have it and are holding everyone who does have it up. Plenty of food options for the airport's size. Bathrooms need cleaning and increasing."
4595,7196,The airport was easily accessible and fast for unloading baggage. The check in was very efficient. The security check only had two officers so it took 1/2 an hour. There were many good food options. The lounge had many seats but they allowed people to move to the other gate's seating area if it got too crowded.
4596,7197,Cleveland Hopkins is a small airport but very clean. It was nice and the people were kind and helpful.
4597,7198,"At least it's not Detroit! Fitting a 777-300er into CLE is hilariously out of place, but made the hub hop more fun."
4598,7199,"Very outdated and long overdue for modernization. However, the airport is easy to navigate, security is generally well managed and United has a comfortable lounge."
4599,7200,I remain puzzled as to why the airport requires long-term parking shuttles to pick up and drop off so remotely. Not convenient and looks shoddy.
4600,7201,"CLE is my home base and therefore am rather partial. However, for ease of security, decent amenities and a very comfortable United Club facility I find traveling in and out of Hopkins low-stress and enjoyable."
4601,7203,"The check-in and facility was alright. Though a couple things needed repairing and there wasn't a lot of staff around, it felt very peaceful and relaxed due to the general lack of people around compared to hubs like O'Hare."
4602,7204,"This airport is connected to the city (and points east) via light rail. As a local resident, this is very helpful because it allows me to park offsite for free and take the train to the airport for a fraction of the cost of parking onsite. The wifi was reliable and quick (downloads went fast and it was reliable enough for me to take and online quiz for one of my classes). The airport itself is OK. Decent food options (there are a few sit down places in addition to fast food - check out local option Great Lakes Brewery) and the usual shopping places. The United Club is very underutilized since this airport was dehubbed, so the club was quite nice and there was plenty of room to stretch out or charge a device. Baggage claim area is fine; the speed of delivery really depends on the airline. For me, it's been anywhere from 10 minutes to 40 minutes waiting. Suggestion: If multiple flights are picking up bags and you are getting picked up at the airport, consider departing from Departures (upstairs) which is almost always less crowded."
4603,7208,"Always an easy in here at Columbia. Fast check-in, fast security and boom. Do wish that the retail locations stayed open a bit longer."
4604,7210,Very nice staff. Quaint little airport with easy check in and very aesthetically pleasing. Clean and has nice foodcourt.
4605,7211,"Airport was clean and thorough. The food choices were great, all of the staff were friendly. Wifi was solid"
4606,7214,"Small-feeling airport for a large city. Easy and quick to get through security. No hassle from check-in through to the gate. But because CMH isn't a large airport, it lacks many facilities like lounges and wide variety in places to eat and drink."
4607,7215,"I was randomly selected for a bag search. I get it, but the place was busy and packed and they were frisking another guy who was TSA Prechecked. That is holding shit up, and we are both TSA Precheck."
4608,7216,A nice sized airport for Class C airspace. It’s easy to get off the plane and get baggage claim.
4609,7217,"Very interesting terminal layout, essentially making it a hallway. Decent food/retail amenities at CMH."
4610,7218,"Columbus was good. Check in was easy but the people behind the counter were aggressive with the bags. I saw a lot of angry passengers. Security was easy and fast. The terminal was ok but a lot of shops were closed. The wifi was pretty bad for a small airport. There was a small news store and it had a lot. The seating near the gate was like any four star airport. Lame, no outlets near the windows. Non comfy. Overall I am going to give it a four."
4611,7219,CMH is my home airport. Decently sized regional airport. Don't expect to see very many boeing or airbus planes. Mostly CRJ or ERJ aircraft.
4612,7220,"No airline has a lounge here, and there is no 3rd party one either. We have Starbucks and a Johnny Rockets. The airport definitely could use a few perks."
4613,7221,"Airport is close to the city and easy to get to by car, taxi, or from downtown by the new AirConnect COTA bus. Terminal is refreshed and is quite nice. WiFi and power throughout the terminal is also a plus. Security lines and check-in lines are always fairly short so you don't have to get to the airport too far in advance. The staff at the airport, including TSA, are generally quite friendly, which is generally not the norm for the industry. The dining and retail options are limited, but there are some good options and finding something to eat or a basic travel necessity shouldn't be difficult. If a flight is arriving late or departing early finding food or shops open is quite difficult. Overall a very nice airport."
4614,7222,"The airport is nice, security is very quick and they are quite professional. Gate staff is friendly as well and the area is well-maintained."
4615,7224,Airport was clean and there was a very good selection of food and beverage with the many restaurants. Quite busy and lack of charging stations. TSA line was reasonable.
4616,7226,"Not a lot to write home about in terms of great facilities, but it's relatively easy to get around this massive airport that's all connected airside with a well-run people-mover."
4617,7227,"Departure and Arrival for roundtrip was from Terminal E. One of the best things about DFW is the parking garages across from the terminal. I was able to park directly across from the TSA Pre entry area. This is my favorite terminal. For a midday departure, the airport was busy but not overcrowded thanks to the wide concourses and spacious seating areas. Dining options are plentiful. This is my favorite terminal at DFW. WiFi was easy to connect too and very fast. Bathrooms were very clean."
4618,7228,"Dfw has always been a walk in the park for security, no matter what terminal I go to it seems I am to my gate within minutes. Now delays are a different story, out of the several times I have flown out of this airport, not one has been close to on time."
4619,7229,"The domestic departure area is very confusing. Everything is overcrowded, confusing and it was impossible to get tickets next to each other even if you arrived on time."
4620,7230,"Departure from Terminal C. Usually Terminal C is very crowded; however, given the early hour of my outbound flight, the terminal was not too busy. Got through security with a minimal wait time courtesy of TSA Pre privileges. I can't rate any dining options as they were closed given my early departure 5:30 a.m. Inbound flight arrival was at Terminal E my favorite terminal. Both Terminal C and E have wide open concourses and plenty of dining options. The terminal is brightly lit with a wide open concourse and plenty of dining options charging points at every gate. Lavatories were clean. I can't rate WiFi as I did not connect to it."
4621,7232,"Best airport I have ever been to. Great food options, long walk though. Terminal C is a bit dingy, but I hear it will be getting renovated soon."
4622,7233,I loved ariving at this airport the tram system took me across the airport fairly quickly and the 7/11 there was cheap.
4623,7234,"I had no idea that airports could close, and then Southwest got me here past midnight, I got there to a closed airport."
4624,7235,"It's been 4 years since I flew out of this airport. The terminal is bright, spacious and has plenty of windows through which to see the airfield. Surprisingly, the airport was not very crowded on the Friday before Labor Day. There was plenty of seating at the gates. The airport has added new dining options from sit down restaurants to fast food. The only drawback to this airport is the lack of bathrooms. The bathrooms are small and there are only 3 stalls in each of the men's bathrooms. This is the same critique I had 4 years ago when I last flew out of this airport. Given the number of passengers that fly through the airport daily, renovating and/or expanding bathrooms should be considered."
4625,7236,"DAL is a great airport, All tho parking may bit of a walk getting in the airport primarily ran by Southwest. Walks to the gate are not long, There are great Retail services around, Wifi could use a little more speed but Overall Great (Using it to write this). Security Check was a bit long for new travelers but you will get used to it, Lounge has Outlets every other seat so charging was a non-issue, living in the Parenting City of MCI this airport is better in my Opinion."
4626,7237,"Airport layout was easy to understand and made it easy to find what you needed. There was plenty of parking and Garage C has a skybridge on level 3 that goes straight to check-in and security. The general security line was long, but TSA PreCheck and the priority line were empty. After security, finding your gate and boarding the plane was simple & easy."
4627,7238,"Dallas Love Filed has turned into a great airport, it's very travel friendly and is just great overall !"
4628,7239,"Very small tiny airport, essentially ghost town at night, but it's nice to have a close back up to cvg"
4629,7240,This airport is small enough to be comfortable but not isolated from the world with very interesting connections to the major hubs
4630,7241,"Convenient and cheap, just old and dated."
4631,7243,"The Daytona Beach airport is a very lovely and clean airport. Each gate has ample seating, there is plenty of sunlight that shines through the large skylights and large windows by the gates. Considering the size of the airport, the food and shopping options are small but nice! Getting to the airport if you don't have a car or are not renting is rather annoying since there are only two bus lines that serve the terminal and they mainly run on an hourly schedule so if you get in at a time inconvenient to the bus schedule and don't have a friend to pick you up you're basically forced to use uber/lyft"
4632,7244,I like the new renovations a lot but the new carpet blends with the walls making it very very bright.
4633,7245,"Nice airport, I like it! It's very convenient to get there, and since it's not one of those giant airport, you'll know where you need to go in a short time."
4634,7246,TINY!!
4635,7247,"DIA is looking a little worse for wear these days; it's still well laid-out and convenient to get between terminals, but the signage and extensive carpeting is dated. Delta is not the highlight here (e.g., no SkyClub) but the Centurion Lounge was expansive and had some regional character. We also didn't have to wait in line to get in, which was a huge plus."
4636,7249,"I arrived From ICT (Wichita, KS) So I don't really know anything about check-in or security check. I only go there Because ICT and SLC don't have connecting flights."
4637,7250,"Sorry, I am unsure about if the baggage claim is good, because I only took a carry-on Also I had a flight to SLC (Salt Lake City) airport after My flight from DEN."
4638,7251,Going through immigration very quickly. No waiting time. But the suitcase didn't come. Suitcases left about 10 minutes after I went through immigration.
4639,7253,Very hard and chaotic to get throught security had to arrive 4 hours early because security took a hour to get through.
4640,7254,It’s a large airport but easy to navigate. Nice rest areas at terminals. Bathrooms are beautiful and well maintained.
4641,7255,"Really fast with C Checkin and Bridge Security! It took about half an hour to get past Siko. United Lounge surprisingly good, pretty new too. You can definitely go there again ;D"
4642,7256,"Great airport overall, could use a little more signage in the check in area. Everything else was amazing, especially the remodeled parts of the terminal!"
4643,7257,"KDSM is my home airport. It is an international airport that celebrities often use as there port of entry because it is far less busy within Customs (located outside the main terminal). Terminal is on the smaller size but with multiple flights leaving out every day, it is usually very busy - especially in the morning. No lounge space here. Airport is hoping to double the amount of gates within the next 10 years which will help broaden the scope of travel to the DSM area."
4644,7258,Baggage claim has greatly improved from a year ago! Back to the speed it used to be and belongs. Nice job!
4645,7259,"DSM is a small airport, so there are very few hassles making your way in or out. Curb to gate in 20 minutes or less is possible if you're not checking a bag, and gate to curb gets you out of there in 5 minutes. Beware arriving in DSM after 21:00 if you expect to rent a vehicle, the rental service counters may be closed for the night; best to call ahead. Good prices on Cyclone/Hawkeye tees at the shop in the terminal pre-security."
4646,7263,"Just arriving late at night, not seen much of airport... but they announced luggage on one carousel and the it was on another one... and getting a taxi is not easy, you have to walk a lot to taxi area and service is not very ""comfortable"" late at night..."
4647,7265,"A very easy airport, sky train in delta terminal. I would recommend for convenience and great stores."
4648,7266,"One of the best laid-out airports in the U.S., with great SkyClubs. Easy to navigate, while huge, and with great options for Delta flights all over the country and the world."
4649,7267,"Having been here as much as I have, this airport never disappoints. Never too crowded, efficient, and the best airport that I've been to in my opinion. Well done."
4650,7268,"KLM lost my bag in Amsterdam, got delivered Sunday Night - Later than it should have, got 5,000 SkyMiles as a result of this delay"
4651,7269,"Oh, Detroit, good ol' Detroit. everything other then the baggage was good. But baggage was awful, after i had grabbed my baggage I had to figure out how to re enter the airport.there was no directory or anything. I spent more time figuring out how to get in then inside."
4652,7271,"The airport's not too bad for the immigration customs when you come here. Lines will take a long time but you shouldn't worry about it that much, you'll get to the baggage claim which takes a lot of time. But the worst part I got at the airport was the delay on an American Airlines flight. TSA wasn't available until maybe hours or so before the flight departed from DTW."
4653,7272,TSA security was problematic with our duty free alcoholic item that we brought in. We finally just checked it with the airline after they made a fuss.
4654,7273,The baggage claim for international flights was very slow. It took almost 45 minutes from arrival to get the bags. Then the bag transfer wasn't very clear.
4655,7274,"So, I am not a bad person but i put a camera in a wine bag and on the way back from RSW they found a wine bottle opener witch the TSA at DTW did not see witch was scary"
4656,7280,"A small but well-run airport serving an important market. One thing to note is that TSA is legendarily strict because of the number of flights to Mexico/Central America, so allow extra time and make sure you don't have anything that could get your bag inspected. Decent options on American and United, only option for Delta is to ATL."
4657,7281,"This airport is surprisingly busy for it's size and location. Very friendly staff at check in, security and at the gates. Past security, there are multiple food options for most any tastes. No lounge, but given it's size and passenger count, this shouldn't be expected. If flying Delta, you're only connection is ATL. If you're flying United you can fly into DEN, IAH and ORD. If flying American you can fly LAX, PHX, DFW, ORD at present. AUS will be discontinued in Feb. If sticking to OneWorld, you can fly Alaska to SEA with evening flights."
4658,7282,El Paso recently introduced a new parking system that is tedious to handle and a tad difficult if you don’t know how to use it they need to introduce a tutorial on how to work the thing.
4659,7283,"Needs better food options. For as small as this airport is, luggage takes quite a while to get out tot he carousel. ELP has a number of shortcomings, but all in all, it's an extremely easy airport to go thru."
4660,7284,NO COMMENT
4661,7291,"Fairbanks is a very nice little airport, you often see people meeting someone they know there because of the small Alaska community. It has a nice coffeeshop and restaurant and bar with a good varity and opening hours compared to the airports small size. When arriving at the airport you have a 2 min walk to leave the airport. If you have bagage you pick that up in the terminal. I can only recommend the airport. Easy in and out with good facilities and parking right in front of the terminal."
4662,7292,"Baggage claim was a bit disorganized, but bags arrived faster than at some. Cool exhibits, taxidermies, etc. all around."
4663,7293,"I just love the airport, and how getting through security is faster than with Clear at some airports"
4664,7294,"A very nice airport for a market this size. TSA even efficient and FRIENDLY!!! Clean airport, but suffers from a common problem encountered in Fairbanks, insanely slow Wi-Fi connections. Put one full flight worth of passengers in the lounge and the speeds plummet to dial up in an instant."
4665,7295,Its a little shocking to realize that the body of water running parallel to your runway is actually a Sea Plane base and that it is in use as you taxi to the gate. You also realize where you are when you taxi to the gate past half a dozen aircraft that are older than you and still in daily service. Fairbanks is a six gate facility with the bare necessities on the edge of the Arctic Circle.
4666,7296,Was delayed an hour de-icing the aircraft because of a shortage of staff. The gate agent was very friendly though.
4667,7297,Really nice small airport! I loved it the moment I walked off the jetway... It has a small town feel to it!
4668,7298,I really like flying out of FAR with it being a smaller airport. Quick check-in and usually a fairly small security line. Enjoy flying out of the smaller airports.
4669,7299,"A great small airport, security is always a breeze and the gate areas are updated and comfortable. Hope more airlines start flying here!"
4670,7301,NEEDS SOME UPDATEING.
4671,7305,We landed at 8:00PM and were connecting for a midnight departure. There was a single restaurant open at that time (closed at 9:00).
4672,7306,In order to transfer airlines you have to exit security and walk outside to the other terminals. It was a pain especially with a short connection time.
4673,7308,"It's been 11 years since I traveled through Terminal 1. The refurbished Terminal 1 is a world class modern airport terminal. It is spacious, brightly lit with plenty of seating and dining options aplenty. There are oodles of power ports and USB ports at the gates; however, some of the power ports were not working. Bathrooms are very clean. The concourses are wide and directions easy to follow to baggage claim. Security was a breeze with no wait time for the TSA-Pre checkpoints. WiFi was easy to connect too and blazing fast. The refurbished terminal is a significant upgrade to the old terminal 1"
4674,7309,The WIFI was pretty good and the airport was clean and nice though a bit busy in the terminal and also unorganized security ( Nearly lost bag )
4675,7310,"Security was long, but very fluid, got through fast. Lots of facilities, bought a plane model and went to a restaurant."
4676,7311,It’s really just a ton of outdated buildings with a ton of restaurant that close at 9:00 PM with barely any seating. Avoid at all costs!
4677,7313,"FLL is my home airport. Check in took a while as Air Canada messed up my family’s boarding passes. Security people were a bit rude, and kept sending us back to get our boarding passes fixed. The terminal before TSA is EXTREMELY outdated. It needs an update."
4678,7314,"This was my first time flying out of FLL, and it was a refreshing change from the decrepit state of MIA. The terminal is much nicer and it's a far shorter journey through security to planeside. The Delta SkyClub is small and cozy, and immediately above Gates D7-D9, offering a nice view of the terminal area below."
4679,7322,"Airport is very small and efficient. Not a big check in area but they were very good. Small security however fast. On the other side there is only one store, a bar and retail shop combined. 2 vending machines near the toilets and a water fountain. Airport was bright and spacious for a terminal of that size. Great wifi, however not so comfortable waiting chairs. Would definitely fly out of GFK again!"
4680,7323,"You have to take GFK for what it is, small. You aren't going to have the luxuries of the major hubs. What it offers is a fast check in, fast security, and a comfortable terminal with wifi."
4681,7324,"I found the GFK airport to be quite easy to go fly out of. The airport was small, as expected, so there was little discrepancy as to where to go."
4682,7325,"While small, GRR was an extremely clean airport. They had free Wi-Fi, but very minimal food and retail."
4683,7326,"While small, GRR was an extremely clean airport. They had free Wi-Fi, but very minimal food and retail."
4684,7327,"No real public transit options, however pickup/drop off area is easy and plenty of parking. Security is nice and quick. The terminal is also very nice, however food options can feel a little limited."
4685,7328,"Once I landed, the airport was nothing much to look at but once you step inside, it's a very nice airport. The parking lot is also very nice and spacious."
4686,7329,"The good thing about this airport is that it is small, very easy to navigate, very little signage is required. Not a lot of food amenities, there's a Starbucks and a small restaurant but that's expected from a small airport. The airport has just undergone a big renovation project that really renovated the parking garage, added a roof to the top floor, and the sky bridge provides convenient access to the terminal from the upper levels. Main lounge is small but adequate, and has an array of small amenities like an ATM, shoe shine, a small conference room, etc. Security is one of the positives of this airport. There aren't a lot of travelers during most parts of the day so the security line it next to nothing. Nothing at all if you have Pre-Check. Terminal layout after security is very simple and small. 7 gates in A, 8 gates in B. All along a simple corridor with small shops and coffee along the way. Average delay is only 5 minutes for any given flight. Overall, this is a great local airport, located a convenient 13 miles (21km) from downtown Grand Rapids. The airport has a good punctuality, good parking, very easy navigation, and a very hassle-free experience unlike that of the modern airport."
4687,7330,Nice small airport. Everyone was friendly and easy to walk around.
4688,7334,"The security guard checking bags was extremely old and it felt like it was a training ground for older TSA agents which is good, but there needed to be some more trainers their."
4689,7335,PTI definitely shows its age a bit. Not a lot in terms of food or retail at least on the south wing. Looks outdated in general. Friendly staff and good Wifi tho.
4690,7336,Headed to Europe for vacation! Little did I know this would be my final trip for awhile due to Covid and a bad marriage.
4691,7337,Its a good airport its small and easy to go to lines are not long for security and the longest wait time is check in
4692,7338,NOT A BAD AIRPORT..
4693,7339,small and reasonable prices.
4694,7340,A quick transit from the arrival gate to the baggage claim whereby the bags were available shortly after arrival.
4695,7341,"I love flying through this airport! They've added more food services, and they are adding a lot more parking this year (2020)."
4696,7342,"Amazing Airport. Everything was really nicely kept up and looked recently remodeled. They also have a big outside area past security, so you can be outside while you wait for your flight."
4697,7343,"Best regional airport in the United States. Easy in, easy out. Cheap (close) parking, and enough amenities."
4698,7344,"Beautifully landscaped, new terminal. Easy rental car return, quick security, nice outdoor garden after security where you can watch takeoffs and landings. All in all a wonderful, small airport."
4699,7345,"Easy to get in and out of, cheap to park, mostly friendly staff and a decent amount of service. Currently under reno."
4700,7352,"I love coming to this airport! Bags delivered quickly, car rental was a snap! Feels almost like flying private!"
4701,7353,"Really awesome airport. It is a very small airport with not many flights. Check in is super simple and there is plenty of staff to help. Security is one of the easiest I've been through. There are a couple restaurants and shops. Wifi works fine. There is a very small lounge that sometimes goes unstaffed, but overall it's nice enough. I would recommend this airport."
4702,7360,"Open airport, so no windows but it can be noisy, humid, and hot shortly after leaving aircraft but got used to it/."
4703,7362,Nice airport only thing is there was a long line and the line is outside but not a big deal because it’s warm. I just wish there was some more space
4704,7363,Easy airport to navigate and security and signage were clear. Nice outside area enroute to United Airlines terminal
4705,7364,Can't complain for the most part. One downfall was that it was a bit confusing to get to check-in from the rental car drop off area.
4706,7365,"The KAL lounge here was not that great, but still, if you have access it would be a nice shelter for you until your flight."
4707,7366,"My family connected to an island hopper Hawaiian Airlines flight, but the interline didn't go smooth and our bags were delayed significantly."
4708,7367,Long walk from international arrival to domestic departure. A lot of the terminal is open-air. Signage to get to the customs bus was not great. Directions to customs once off the bus was lacking. Customs folks were pleasant and helpful
4709,7368,"A simple burger king meal was $15 without drinks, very expensive. The outdoor walkway and humid environment provides a unique airport experience though."
4710,7371,This airport is massive. Give yourself at least 2.5 hrs minimum to switch terminals and get connecting flights. Distance from gates to immigration in Terminal E is very long. Thanks to Mobile Passport Control we were able to get through immigration without any long lines. Terminal E is gorgeous. Can't rate food etc as I just transited through it. wiFi connection (free airpot) was excellent.
4711,7372,Lots of construction. Few food options. Broken bathrooms. It’s sad… this airport used to be much better. Looking forward to new renovations.
4712,7373,"The luggage was probably outside during the thunderstorm and got leifder very wet, including the contents!"
4713,7374,A MEGA airport. Plan lots of time if you need to switch terminals for your connecting flight. Lots of places to eat.
4714,7377,"Fairly smooth on arrival although every other aspect of this airport involved long wait times. The signage is terrible and I got lost more than once. Baggage took forever to make it to reclaim, and the rental cars are only accessible via a bus which doesn’t arrive frequently. While waiting for the bus you’re stuck out in the hot humid environment and there is no air conditioned waiting area."
4715,7378,"Crowded like any other airport, good selection for food but not anything special, not a whole lot of seating at Terminals."
4716,7379,"Nice airport, not much to say here easy to get to baggage claim. I was in the A gates. A little bit of a walk maybe like .5/.25 of a mile to the baggage claim."
4717,7380,Terminal E is under construction and should be avoided at all costs if you have people picking you up. Hav them pick you up in Terminal C or A to avoid the traffic
4718,7381,Excellent hub for SouthWest with Lots of nice staff Security check was the usual long line but it only took like 20 Mins. Not much else to say.
4719,7382,"Terminal facilities were plentiful. Arrived at Hobby from Austin via connecting flight. As originally posted on the airport directory, gate for connection was one gate away. But, that was changed to one far away. That was frustrating, but obviouly, part of traveling. The seats weren't the most comfrtable either. An airport is an airport if it gets you there."
4720,7383,Small little airport perfect to get into when your departing quickly or arriving quickly. Good selection of snacks.
4721,7384,"My first time in Honby, almost missed the sign that says to baggage. Well actually I did miss it! But otherwise easy to navigate"
4722,7385,"Security was very fast. Although my ticket wasn't even checked, and still had to remove my belt, in the precheck line"
4723,7386,Quick and easy navigation through the airport with decent restaurant choices. There are several electric outlets available throughout the terminal area and Wifi is free. Unfortunately there is no lounge here
4724,7387,"There is now a chick-fil-a in the Houston Hobby airport, it's located in the international gate area. I believe gates 1-5. Other than this your best food option is Buffalo Wild Wings. All opinion though because there are other places to eat such as Wendy's, Pappas Burgers, Subway and Papaduex seafood."
4725,7388,"Small airport is convenient for getting in and out of. Bad options for food/drinks, one of the most expensive airports in the country. About 12 nonstop destinations."
4726,7389,"One of my favorite things about the Huntsville Airport is the hotel that is attached to the airport. I didn't expect this for a smaller airport, and it was very nice."
4727,7390,NICE AIRPORT FAST TURNAROUNDS GREAT FOOD..
4728,7393,"First time at IND. Wonderful facility compared to all the Los Angeles area airports. Very open feel, very clean."
4729,7394,TSA PRe Check is very slow here. Newer machines take forever to process. Only terminal A has pre-check
4730,7395,"TSA security is not staffed to efficiently handle the flow of people. Having traveled through the airport frequently, there are always large queues after RealID check. Machines and staffing are rotated but persons leave area and wait for replacement. Suggestively, the replacement show up and then the person rotate."
4731,7396,One of the best airports I’ve ever been too. They have exceptional service throughout the airport security lines are easy.
4732,7397,"I've traveled to dozens of airports in my lifetime, and I have to say that little ol Indy is certainly one of the best in America. Its so easy to get through security, even recently when I forgot my ID! The staff have always been consistently friendly and on top of that the airport itself is very modern, exceptionally clean, and has plenty of dining and food options although at a decent expense. Overall, about as good as they get in America!"
4733,7398,"Indianapolis International is ranked as one of the best airports in the United States for a reason. As always, super clean, security efficient, and super friendly place."
4734,7399,"It is one spacious and lovely airport, and if you do happen to be late, crew and airport staff always put you first, and I just in general love the airport."
4735,7400,IND Airport is fairly spacious and has several restaurants on the inside of the terminal. The inside seems to be very modern and spacious.
4736,7401,"New clean spacious airport. It was weird to see the baggage claim after existing the air-side (same for all US airports). The airport wasn’t far from the city, 20mins by car."
4737,7402,"Best airport overall in the US! Clean, efficient and short TSA lines. Only complaint is that their prices at restaurants are pretty high in my opinion."
4738,7404,"Airport's on the edge of town. Took awhile to get our bags. Reason I put is a 4-star is because it's a small airport serving a small area, so for those purposes it's got what you need."
4739,7405,Lady at the AA counter was pretty rude. Granted I showed up 10 min before the flight.. with a guitar
4740,7406,Its a very efficient airport and getting through security is super easy. The TSA staff + plus checkin staff were very friendly. There is direct busses every 30 minutes from downtown Ithaca and is very accessible.
4741,7407,The airport is pretty nice. I love small airports because they are easy to get into. The security line was quick and easy. One of the biggest problems is that there is barely any food there just a few little snack stores but nothing that big. Overall my experience was good. I love flying with delta
4742,7408,"I first though that, due to its unfortunate location, that this airport would be a dump. I was very surprised by how clean and efficient this airport is! Only problem is the lack of many food options."
4743,7409,"I had read that Jackson was ranked as one of the top airports, and was completely baffled that it could be ranked anywhere near the top. It's set up really oddly, there are no real restaurants past security. It's much smaller than I expected. While getting there isn't difficult, check in is quick, it's the general atmosphere of an airport with very few amenities. I would expect this for a smaller city, but Jackson seems like it should have more options."
4744,7410,"I flew in from Washington D.C. When i got to the aiport, it was clean, the people were nice, and the wifi was pretty good. On a scale of 1-10 i would give it a 9.99 because the airport was fantastic."
4745,7411,"TSA is extremely active in their work. All bags checked, bottles with liquids open and not closed afterwards. Stuff in the bags messed up. Be prepared that you will be ""X-rayed"" by personnal eyes. Spelling the of names in passport and ticket were not the same due to new transliteration rules for cyrillic, and only in JAN airport clerks paid attention."
4746,7412,"Getting to the airport was super easy, even with offsite car rental, there was no trouble checking any bags and getting through security took about 5 minutes. The bathrooms were very clean and smelled good."
4747,7413,"the view from landing/taking off of the tetons is so pretty, especially in the winter when the snow is falling, tetons in the back. although landing in winter/when it’s snowing can be very rough, it is still cool to experience that one airport in the national park."
4748,7414,"By far one of the most beautiful airports I have ever been to. The whole terminal is coated in a rich oak wood, which perfectly sets the stage for a trip to Wyoming. Plus, you board from the ramp, which is an awesome experience."
4749,7415,"Jackson Hole is the most unique, interesting, and cool airport I have flown to in the USA. Where else can you disembark outside and see the mountains a mile away?"
4750,7416,"Very nicely built airport. It looks like it belongs in the snow. An arch made of antlers to greet passengers to the airport is a great touch. Now, the reason for the 4 stars is, this only applies if you are making a connection through Jackson, you have to exit security then go back through it. So, don't make tight connections here at Jackson."
4751,7417,Fast TSA and boarding pass. Of course I was 3 1/2 hours early…lol. Only downfall was no electric plugs in the lounge seats. Had to use wall sockets. No big deal though.
4752,7418,"Got from the parking lot to the gate in less than 15 minutes, which allowed me plenty of time to go for some much-needed bites before my flight took off -- would go here again if I had a chance"
4753,7419,Pristine and nice terminal facilities. JAX could do better with the food and retail services in the terminal but I do like the aviation museum however.
4754,7420,"JAX is a relatively small but great airport. It's nicely designed and welcoming to its passengers. Getting to the city is a bit of a challenge if you don't want to use Uber/Lyft or a taxi. There is a regular bus line that takes about one hour to get to downtown but from there you need to make arrangements to get to your final destination. Mind you, there are no taxis waiting at the Rosa Parks bus stop."
4755,7422,"My home airport and always my favorite. I got here too early this trip - and found that there's nothing open past security, not even for coffee, before 5:00 AM and the Starbucks locations were not particularly prompt about opening on time (not the fault of the airport)."
4756,7423,"I have reviewed JIA previously. Basically no difference - it's a real nice airport. It's small, but does all the important things well. Would be nice if there were more options for eating/shopping, especially early in the morning which is when I am usually flying, but hard to expect given the size."
4757,7424,"I will always have a soft spot for Jacksonville International as it is the closest thing to my ""home"" airport. My trips all begin and end here. As such I've watched the place grow and improve over the years, and I've had lots of practice dealing with the things that are specific to this place - getting to and from the airport, parking, security, baggage claim, etc. JAX may be small, but it's really nice - clean, efficient, and easy to navigate. Food choices are decent (but not spectacular), WiFi works, bathrooms are plentiful and clean. Free shuttles to and from long-term parking are an amenity I use every trip. Check-in with various airlines is smooth. Security is what it is, but no worse than anywhere else. There are nice waiting areas near the gates with extra power plugs. In short - this is a good airport."
4758,7429,"Flight in was awesome. Amazing view on final/approach. Nice international Airport, not to big. At bag claim it gave some travel tips."
4759,7432,"hmm, don’t really remember this airport. i remember it not being busy, which is good of course for baggage claim, security, and more. i thought it was just a normal, small airport. last year is when i found out they fly 777 and 787 there! i couldn’t believe it and since then i liked it a bit better."
4760,7433,The Kahului Airport badly needs an upgrade in facilities. It serves its purpose well but it’s looking really dated in the terminal and gate area. The TSA agent we dealt with in TSA Precheck was a complete asshole with a terrible attitude. He’s the kind of guy that gives the organization a bad name. No spirit of aloha there.
4761,7434,Kahului is not the nicest airport. Not very clean and a bit cramped for the number of passengers traveling through.
4762,7435,OGG is always a great airport to land at. Everyone is always very happy. The walk to the baggage terminal from anywhere in the airport is always under 10 minutes and when you get there airport employees are always very quick about getting your luggage on the carousel
4763,7436,Getting through security could’ve been a long process. Thankfully I was a single parent traveling with two kids under 12 so I got the special treatment- no complaints other than we had to leave paradise.
4764,7437,"very busy airport, new terminal under construction, so the upgrade should help a lot, waiting area for flights is very cramped hopefully this will be addressed in the new terminal as well as some more restaurants and shops to checkout while you wait"
4765,7438,"This is an airport in which if you don't have pre-check, no big deal. You can still make it through in good time. Just plan ahead is what I always say. Don't wait until the last hour to get through with any TSA lines. I noticed both lines moved almost equally in terms of time."
4766,7441,"One of the nicest, newest airport terminals around. Glass jet bridges are a very nice touch, allwoing you to see the ground crew and nearby planes as you wait to board. Plenty of amenities in the airport too."
4767,7442,"New terminal is nice, can use more food options closer to the gates rather than just in the middle of the terminal"
4768,7443,"The new airport in Kansas City has been a long time coming but it ticks all the boxes. Easy check-in, efficient security. Good art, reasonable volume, great amenities, outstanding lounge. This raises the bar for what a non-hub airport for a medium size city should be."
4769,7444,"So very much better than it used to be! It’s no longer torture if you show up early or your flight is delayed. I got my bags checked and through security very quickly, had plenty of time for BBQ, beer, coffee, picking up some snacks for the hotel, and just wandering around. Very easy to navigate and so much room. Love it!"
4770,7445,The new KCI (actual code MCI) terminal is absolutely gorgeous and incredibly convenient. Easy to navigate with tons of amenities and food/drink options. Cannot recommend this terminal highly enough. If you had ever visited the old KCI terminals you won’t even believe you’re at the same airport.
4771,7449,"As always, quick departure from the plane to walking at MCI. But, the gate seemed to be the farthest from the baggage claim possible. Once bag found, I moved quickly outdoors. Within a couple of minutes, ""The Sport"" bus showed up and took me to the car. All most reasonable."
4772,7452,Definitely liked the airport for it's a small size and the ability to walk outside to the airplane. Wish they could modernize the check and counters for scanning tickets off cell phones.
4773,7453,"Definitely an odd layout. The baggage claim area is a little crammed, but the rest of the airport is really cool and really unique."
4774,7454,Small. Not a lot of room in the terminal or food. Security was a bit slow. All flights board on air stars no jetways
4775,7457,Super easy in and to the gate. TSA was very easy. Very little open late at night. Vending machines were hard to find.
4776,7458,"Couldn't be any easier than this. Very easy to get from the gate to the curb, particularly without any checked luggage."
4777,7459,"Modern regional airport with a good selection of food options from Ruby Tuesday to Quizno. Car rentals are in the paking struture across from the terminal so no need to board any shuttle, a major time saver. Also to access car returns, you go in front of the terminal, so you can easily drop off people. From there, you need to go up one level to get to Departures"
4778,7460,"Airport is small and easy to navigate. However, very disappointed in ""Covid-Restricted"" food services. Most food retailers only open for 2 hour window during peak hours without regard for needs of the travelling public."
4779,7461,KOA It’s the best little open air airport! I love the natural breeze and ramp views as you board and deplane via air stairs!
4780,7463,I liked it! It was outside and nice with the wonderful Hawaiian weather. Taxiing and deplaning did take a while but that’s not the airports fault. Baggage claim was ok just took a while. I’ll rate Wi-Fi and food service on the way back
4781,7466,"The rental car return shuttles were very full. The check in line at the airport took almost an hour because of the Portland Flight ahead of us, and as well as pets that were being shipped. I had to wait for almost an hour before I was helped. The airport is all outside, which means the weather is warm. The seating at the airport wasn't very comfortable."
4782,7467,"The airport is outdoors. The weather there after arriving at the airport is very warm. Getting off the plane, there is no bridge. You have to walk to the airport. The baggage claim had a problem that day. It stopped several times before the luggage arrived."
4783,7468,Charming open air airport in Hawaii settings. No airconditioned terminal or waiting rooms. Check-in to mainland is a little bit complicated walking up and down between check-in / vetenary check / bag drop.
4784,7469,"Lovely outdoor airport, rustic with few amenities but great staff and quick service. We arrived as we normally do for international flights and found ourselves with 2 hours to spare. Do not come too early to this airport for checkin, they don't even open until 8am. No lounge to be found."
4785,7475,"LAS is in desperate need of expansion. It's conveniently located, but always feels hectic inside. Delta should open a SkyClub here as it has plenty of flights and there are plenty of Delta passengers. The Centurion Lounge, while spacious and nice, was crowded due to the paucity of other lounge options."
4786,7476,"The small business lounge offers a good view, a small bar and a good small buffet for breakfast."
4787,7477,"At that time, I was treated like a criminal by the immigration officers from the Home Security Agency simply because I had entered the USA too often within the last 12 months"
4788,7478,"It’s a great airport once you get to know it, just the naming should still be McCarran. It’s my home airport, so I got to know it over the years"
4789,7479,"The new named Harry reid international it's an old airport well the terminal 1 part it is, while the crew works to maintain the installations clean is always dirty due to the vast amount of traffic that occurs at the airport. Filled with casinos and memorabilia of the old las vegas the airport has something for everybody. Terminal 3 being the international part is the most modern area in the entire airport. Parking is definitely an issue for employees as for travelers alike, plan ahead if you want to park here, food options are plenty but the prices is one of the things most people complain, you'll see all type of people in the airport, being vegas everything seems wild."
4790,7480,"Average Airport not really great, the smell of cigars annoys me. It’s alright to get anywhere in the southwest."
4791,7481,Huge with 3 terminals connected by trains. Terminal 3 and probably the other 2 do not offer enough seating with ac outlets. And the seating consists of rows of black chairs. It is dated by today standards. It's hard to find where the hotel shuttles pick up. Only in T1?
4792,7482,"Location is convenient but it was really kinda trashy. Like I had second thoughts about taking my shoes off for security, and I set my phone down only to realize it was wet and gross. Fair amount of trash left around."
4793,7484,"Terrible experience!!! Terminal 3 had one security line that made you walk about a half mile just to get to the front. The line of planes to get out was terrible and they only were taking off on one runway, Vagas needs another runway for how big they are."
4794,7489,"Lihue definitely is in need of updating and upgrading, it was built for just two to three inter island airlines back in the 80’s but now they have multiple airlines with transpacific flights on a daily basis making the terminal outdated to accommodate those transpacific flights, just one restaurant which is expensive but the food is good but not the best , got a Starbucks and a lounge that is closed every time I am there."
4795,7490,"First time riding United and it was very nice and fun! The food was cold but the ""ginger ale"" was nice"
4796,7492,"Cute little ""International Airport"" on Kauai. Nice island feel - open to the air in most sections. Not very many shops, but the Starbucks is nice for early morning flights. No international flights except for the Westjet one to Vancouver, Canada."
4797,7493,"Very pittoresque little airport on the Island of Kauai. Just outside you will see the local free going chickens in different colours. Open air facilities and piers, but built in gates with aircondition. Close to the town of Lihue. Facilities are generally good and staff friendly."
4798,7495,Such a beautiful island!
4799,7496,They have really updated the main terminal and streamlined the TSA process. Very good facility for a small airport
4800,7497,"Lincoln Municipal Airport is quite small, but very comfortable and friendly airport. There is free WiFi, quite well working, high speed. Airport also offers complimentary coffee for passengers waiting for boarding in gate areas, which is not usual (so far I experienced complimentary coffee only once in FRA in 2012)."
4801,7499,a very nice small airport. That has open seating in places so you can smell fresh air while you sit.
4802,7500,"Great little airport! It's almost kind of cute. Only a handful of gates, two bag claims. Rental car locations are a couple hundred feet from the terminal. Would love to fly into here again."
4803,7501,This is the easiest airport to fly in and out of! Simply the best. It’s got that “Catch me if you can” feel. Old school
4804,7502,"Long beach is a very nice and small airport. My tip is, don’t book an early flight because lots of people will all be getting there at the same time due to the close departure times."
4805,7503,"it’s a great airport because of it size, easy to get in and easy to get out. The best way to get there would probably be a lyft, uber, or a bus."
4806,7504,Greatest smallest airport. Convenient and efficient with class. Living in Southern California I will always try to fly in and out of Long Beach.
4807,7505,Great experience. New glass terminal looks sharp. Deplane to ground transportation in less than 5 min.
4808,7506,Easy airport with little to no lines at security. Price for food is a bit high. Easy and laid back atmosphere.
4809,7507,"Small, chic airport. Gives a California feel when you enter the terminal. The outdoor waiting area was a very nice addition."
4810,7508,"Great job with the renovation. Bags a bit slow. Good gate agent, forgot a bag and she got it for me."
4811,7510,"LAX Is enjoyable to fly into in the southwest terminal, a few food options and a few gift shops. Tsa was a bit slow (coming from an australian) Overall lax southwest terminal was a good experience for me!"
4812,7511,Sunday mornings had really busy traffic. 20 minutes from getting to the airport to the terminal for drop off. Terminal 6 has excellent amenities.
4813,7512,"As CK status for American, my experience is not typical. However, from the flagship check in, flagship lounge and individualized transportation to the regional gates, LAX is one of the best airports to hold this status with American."
4814,7514,"I was hoping to see a celebrity, but sadly that didn't happen and I wasn't too disappointed because the probability of actually seeing one is astronomically low. This was my first time at LAX and I was actually surprised at the small amount of people there was. Maybe due to the fact that this was in the evening. I don't know. So for this particular flight, not crowded at all and we got our luggage pretty quickly. :)"
4815,7515,TBIT at the time of our flight the best of the LAX terms. Since the airport is under construction transport of any type is a major hassle
4816,7516,arrived with the crew and the aircraft Wunala made her way to the Qantas hanger at the eastern end of the airport
4817,7517,Tom Bradley terminal had a lot of traffic. Good is they have facial recognition which means they do not have to scan boarding passes at all.
4818,7518,I hate Los Angeles the city but on intl flights I can get from my seat to my car in 25 minutes by using the Mobile Passport Control app and parking at the official economy parking with it's frequent buses.
4819,7519,"As a Delta traveler flying through LAX, the new terminal experience looks very nice, but can be very crowded and a lot of walking from check-in to gate. The Sky Club is spacious and grand, and the views and outdoor area are a nice touch, but it's often crowded and out of the way, far from where your gates will actually be. The gate areas themselves are decently well organized, amenities are easily accessible from just about any gate."
4820,7520,"Louisville is an okay airport. It's close to downtown and nearby to famous sites you would likely visit like Churchill to distilleries. Also the airport itself looks nice, but is shorthanded on choices and so forth. I had a morning flight, and I did my research and ate before I went since the only true breakfast choices past security is Starbucks and Chilis. Rest weren't open yet. Also like any Starbucks in an airport, it was painfully packed for those who needed caffeine to survive the day. The shops are fine. There is a whiskey store, but if you fly out Sunday, they can't start selling until 1pm due to blue laws nonsense that should be off the books. I digress, I wasn't planning on getting anything, but they had some good whiskies as a last minute gift idea. Otherwise your stores are basically the news store with snacks and a magazine. I didn't see a full book store at all, or an electronic store. But the news stores to vending machines sold a good selection of headphones. Finally, the seating is outdated. They don't have outlets at all outside of a random wall spot that I was lucky to find at an empty gate that morning, but no luck at a full gate. Wifi worked on my phone, but not on my PC. It refused to be authorized. Overall it's an okay airport. It's clean, lighting is good, and the facilities work. The only huge issue is the wifi for me at least. But the biggest issue is the lack of outlets in 2022. That is a necessity nowadays for work to entertainment. p.s.: TSA precheck was a little slow for some reason. Not a long or crazy line, but it dragged. Especially compared to other airports like O'Hare to EWR."
4821,7521,"Nice, easy airport to get around and fairly good shopping & food for a small airport. Downsides: VERY slow Wi-Fi, and no airline clubs other than a USO club."
4822,7522,Nice for spotting US Army aircrafts are parked
4823,7525,"Really an easy airport, probably one of the easiest to get through that I've been in. It's a small regional so don't expect lounges or anything like that, but there were a couple decent looking places for food and a drink. Just a really pleasantly quiet quick and easy airport!"
4824,7526,"MSN is one of the easiest airports to navigate. Only operates 13 gates with 4 airlines. Gates 1-2 are airport communal used mostly by Delta. Gate 3 is used by Frontier, gates 4-6 operated by United, gates 7-10 are operated by Delta and gate 12-13 operated by American with gate 11 being the third communal gate usable by all airlines. The airport just renovated all of their dining options with mostly being grab-n-go foods that could be of better quality. There is only one sit down restaurant and one wine bar that are post-security. TSA is super efficient and friendly and ticketing for all airlines is in one central area where wait times are minimal to none! Definitely love traveling this airport."
4825,7535,Very fast through this airport. we touched down at 12.01pm and were loading cases into hire car by 12.35! This airport is normally quick to get through immigration etc. but this time I couldn't believe how fast we were through and off on our way
4826,7536,Melbourne has vastly improved during the pandemic with the new renovations rivaling TPA and FLL as one of the nicest airports in Florida.
4827,7538,"Easiest flight out of an airport I have had in years, 30 seconds at security and no obstructions or delays. Bathrooms were very clean as well."
4828,7539,"Not much to see or do here, but the small size makes traveling here a painless experience. Security is almost always fast, and there's no traffic getting in or out. Don't go expecting great transit connections though."
4829,7540,"Nice and simple airport, no crazy turns and routes to get around the airport. But it could use abit more amenities."
4830,7541,"THIS IS A GREAT AIRPORT , NO CROWDS LOTS OF ROOM IN THE TERMINAL AREA NICE PEOPLE , NOT MUCH ON FOOD . BUT NOT ENOUGH FLIGHTS , I T COULD USE MORE FLIGHTS IN AND OUT, THE ONLY PLACE WHERE THE TSA PEOPLE ARFE HAPPY AND SMILE"
4831,7542,Economy parking is now $10 a day.... Surrounding parking lots are also $10. No longer cheaper to park.
4832,7544,It is a good airport for its size there is an okay seating area but that may change with the new concourse b
4833,7545,MEM's new B concourse is way better than I had imagined! I feeling like I am walking around a European airport.
4834,7546,"It is an outdated airport with barely any shops and good inside. However, there is a new terminal being built and it looks very nice but they will not open it even though it is done. Security was easy with TSA precheck but get there early during covid to get your tickets because it is packed around 6am."
4835,7547,Always park at the economy garage for the best rates ($6 / day) and take the covered walkway to the terminal. TSA may question you about why you're bringing camera equipment through for some reason.
4836,7548,"A great airport, easy to get to. The lines were nice and quick, and I was at my flight 30 minutes earlier than I expected."
4837,7549,I actually don't remember anything much about this airport. I was here for a connecting flight (started in Jacksonville FL and was on the way to Las Vegas).
4838,7550,"Easy access to the ticketing and gates. Had a little hard time with a CSR in Memphis with jumpseat agreements. Upon arriving to Memphis, the car rental was a very long walk. Surprised by the long walk (it was also 27 degrees so it wasn't feeling like a casual stroll either). Easy check in and check out."
4839,7553,"Feels fairly dated and cramped, even in the American areas, which is surprising for a hub. The main concourse areas have a little character but off the main drag it's in desperate need of a facelift. That's all the more true if you're not flying American."
4840,7556,"Immigration and baggage claims are annoying when you are transferring on your flight. They have quite strict security and I had to go through the baggage claim and immigration / customs again because of the security, which is not good if you have a transfer flight in less than 1 hour."
4841,7557,"Poor food options in the H/J Concourses, Security line was over 30 minutes at the H checkpoint as they had Regular & TSApre line combined and verified by enterance. By the time it was my tern to enter the regular line, the lady checking the boarding passes (not a TSA employee) stopped us from entering for 5ish minutes when we could have entered"
4842,7558,"Poor food options in the H/J Concourses, Security line was over 30 minutes at the H checkpoint as they had Regular & TSApre line combined and verified by enterance.

4844,7560,"Some traffic entering the terminal on a busy travel day, but not nearly as bad as I've experienced in other US airports. Terminal experience was pretty average in the north terminal, though I still believe that MIA has some of the best dining options in the whole country, simply because they have Latin food (and Cafe Versailles). The Amex lounge is quickly becoming too small for its demand in Miami."
4845,7561,"Hi. I am Nicholas, and I am writing this to let you all hear my enjoyment about MIA int’l airport. Getting into the airport, there wasn’t too much traffic for me, because it was a weekday I think. Check in was great, the reason I love the security check is because I saw a cat in there, and I love cats. Terminal facilities were cool, but I don’t know about their Wi-Fi because I used my cellular data. The Starbucks in there was great and I didn’t visit the Lounge, so I don’t know about it either. Overall, it’s a 4/5 for me."
4846,7562,"Relatively quick check-in and security check, but the E terminal is very dated and very cramped, especially for an A380."
4847,7564,"Perfect. Airport is a good size because it used to be a hub, but since it isn't anymore, there is plenty of space and no overcrowding. Fast, efficient, pleasant TSA, etc. All pros, no cons other than I wish the free wifi was a bit faster."
4848,7565,the airport is clean and its location is convenient because it is so close to downtown and wifi was fast and there was plenty of food options
4849,7566,Milwaukee is a clean airport at least in the concourse I flew into. it has got good food options and the layout Is simple
4850,7567,"I may be biased due to me living in Milwaukee, however I find that as frequent as I fly Southwest, I always love flying out of Concourse C. Yes, D might be bigger and do not get me wrong I loved the days when I could fly Southwest out of D post- Midwest, however the Concourse always seems lively, it has a Starbucks, food, and even a kids play area. Security has never taken more than 5 minutes, and I LOVE the retro vibe you get when walking into the check in area."
4851,7568,"Getting in and out of MKE is a breeze, and it features one of my favourite Delta Sky Clubs. With that said, there aren't many dining or retail options after security, on the D Concourse at least. Also, I have had issues in the past with TSA regarding checking oversized items."
4852,7569,i love ur airport i made a fake flight just to say that i like this airport_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
4853,7570,"Not very many food options on terminal D. It's pretty much just one restaurant. The restaurant is good, but there isn't much else. It's Starbucks, that restaurant, or gift shop sandwiches."
4854,7571,"great airport that had public transportation. Great eateries, a wonderful museum, and very nice facilities."
4855,7572,"C19 has destroyed air travel, no one is out. Twelve pax on flight. You can tell that the employees are stressed."
4856,7573,"Checking into flights at small airports is the way to go. Little traffic, small and quick lines to check in, and relatively short TSA checkpoints. Even without pre-check, we were through pretty quickly. Of course the terminal has fewer amenities than ORD or PHX, but it's sufficient. I didn't need not did I check for wifi or lounges."
4857,7576,Very quick TSA check. Very clean and nice bathrooms. Nice restaurants and cafes. Very friendly gate agent. Recommended.
4858,7577,"One of the best laid-out airports in the country with excellent facilities that keep being improved upon. Even this transfer, from Concourse C to G, was straightforward, by taking the back route and avoiding the main concourse. The 3 Delta lounges are excellent, including the brand-new one in Terminal G, which is one of the best in the US."
4859,7578,"Terminal is clean and modern, and security did not take long. Signs are readable and informative. There is no diplomatic line at passport control. When arriving, getting to the light rail station is a bit tedious, but it’s easy to follow the signs."
4860,7579,"this airport is amazing! the security is super nice, Airport is rarely packed but I did have to wait some time for a car rental other than that it's amazing"
4861,7580,"MSP is not a bad airport. Access, parking, and the screening were all pretty easy and quick. Facilities are clean and maintained."
4862,7581,"I personally enjoy being at the Minneapolis Airport! If you have a long layover I suggest you don’t fly Southwest, JetBlue, or Suncountry, because there’s not a lot of food choices, 3 restaurants, Starbucks and a small shop with snacks."
4863,7582,"Terminal 1 at Minneapolis/St Paul is easily one of the best airport experiences in the US. It has plenty of space to get a quite spot to sit, a lot of food options, plenty of shops, including things that are not the standard hudson news and similar stores. it has a book shop, a couple of outdoor clothing stores, even a store devoted to minnesota icon Prince. just all around excellent. I've never been delayed there, but if I had to be I wouldn't complain."
4864,7583,Quite a few restaurants were closed and whatever was open was fairly busy with long lines. American Airlines E gates are almost always cramped due to the airline having multitude of delays.
4865,7584,"Another great experience departing from MSP. The airport was busy, but I had no issues getting through check-in and security in a very timely fashion."
4866,7590,Nice to return to my hometown. Visit to the Monterey Bay Aquarium with my wife and our young daughter was a real treat!
4867,7591,"The convenience factor cannot be overlooked. It's also fun to ground load. The terminal post-security consists of four walls, some seats, and a bathroom."
4868,7592,"Small, regional airport. Very convenient if you are staying in the Monterey / Carmel area. The have streamlined screening for TSA Pre-check, but no specific pre-check line and no priority access line. This is an airport with no jet bridges - you must use stairs to get on and off the plane"
4869,7596,"The location is excellent, right on the beach, and easy to get to. Just not all airlines serve this airport."
4870,7597,Easy airport. Not too big. Good shops and restaurants. Just right. Can get pretty busy at the right times.
4871,7598,"Always a lovely airport. Clean with friendly staff, a good amount of food options and it looks very modern in and outside."
4872,7599,Absolutely love MYR. Perfect amount of accommodations for the size of the airport. Always clean and friendly staff. Easy check in and TSA line.
4873,7600,As my home airport it was pleasant flying home after two months. It’s not too large but it’s big enough. Very modernized at least in the new terminal. Nacho hippo is great make sure to stop by. Staff is always great.
4874,7602,"Really nice, well kept, small airport. Everyone was friendly, even at 11 PM."
4875,7603,"Once the construction activities are done, it'll probably be less annoying to get around. For now infrastructure improvements while important suck when they're being made but greatly appreciate once they're complete. Just, the pricing of the economy parking nearly makes flying out of my closest airport an attractive choice."
4876,7604,"Nashville airport is easy to navigate and TSA lines are well marked. Did not take but 15 minutes or less to get through. Very expensive parking, especially long-term “economy” lots!"
4877,7605,Nashville is a clean airport with friendly staff and I totally recommend it to anyone flying out of Tennessee
4878,7606,Nashville is a clean airport with friendly staff although a 5 star rating may be biased because I had TSA PRE regular security lines looked short For an airport of this growing magnitude
4879,7607,"Very nice but compact South terminal due to construction at the moment, so arrive early, but otherwise very good"
4880,7608,Pretty nice terminal with good facilities and nice staff. I also think the food and retail services within the terminal.
4881,7609,"One of the best airports I’ve been to. Very fast through security, parking was not difficult and the airport is pretty easy to navigate. They are still doing a lot of renovations and a lot of the stores are closed, but it was still a great experience!"
4882,7611,"A lot of choices to wait out your 3-4 hour Southwest Airlines delay! You can find the normal shops and stores, but there are also ""Music City"" themed restaurants like Gibson's and Tootsies! The terminal area is very nice!"
4883,7612,absolutely zero lines
4884,7614,"It's an airport...better than some, worse than others. Food and stores seemed somewhat limited and - at least getting down the A concourse - the walk is super long, with no train or moving walkway to ease things. Luckily we had a lot of time."
4885,7615,"Good airport. Could do with some more spacious lounge areas, and security can get a bit hectic at times. Otherwise decent."
4886,7616,"Nice brightly lit airport. Access roads/ramps are still being built (12/21), so congestion in and around the airport area/Rental car return is very likely. Give yourself at least 1/2 hour to return a rental car and get back to the Terminal."
4887,7619,"Hard to say how I'd rate it here (bearing in mind an entirely new airport is under construction). On one hand there's not much to speak of as far as amenities, places to eat and shop, etc. Just small and basic. Big plus though for the place not being an absolute zoo. Felt pretty relaxed compared to larger airports I've been through."
4888,7622,"Immigration clearance a bit of bind, As with most USA airports, expect to take one hour to clear this small airport."
4889,7623,"I must admit I was pretty disappointed with parts of MSY. Getting to the airport and check in aren't bad. The security check is rather hectic going into Terminal C, and it is very narrow. The terminal facilities feel older than most airports. The wifi barely worked, and the food options in terminal C were extremely disappointing."
4890,7626,"JFK, especially the international terminal, is more chaotic than ever. The SkyClubs are overrun with people, so the new club opening will hopefully add more of a respite in the chaos for Delta travelers."
4891,7627,"Somewhat of a small terminal considering the massive scale of JFK, but considering the size of terminal selection of shops was respectable. JFK itself was quite far away. Security lines was super long but At least there was a shortcut for Business/First passengers."
4892,7628,"Terminal 4. TSA pre check is a must. Security wait times can be 40+ minutes. Lots of shops and restaurants. Depending on your gate, be prepared for a lot walking."
4893,7629,Obviously because I was in Business class I flew through that airport at the speed of a plane at takeoff and I was straight into that lounge
4894,7630,Super quick and it was super fun to see all the big cargo planes and all of that flying over and taxiing and stuff
4895,7631,"The airport was very big and beautiful, the CBP officer that I went to was really nice and welcoming. The people are friendly and the airport is just lovely."
4896,7634,"Check in personnel was very rude. Complained that bag drop was about to close in ten minutes, why did I not come earlier. Turns out the flight was even delayed so I got scolded for nothing"
4897,7635,"Such a great airport all around, especially terminal B. Maple Leaf lounge was great too, although no view of the runway/taxiway."
4898,7636,"After landing, realized I forgot the camera in the plane. Staff was very nice and I got it back in 10 mins."
4899,7637,"Although there was a huge traffic jam on the way to the airport, the airport was sparkling clean and efficient as always."
4900,7638,"The new Terminal C is a significant improvement over the old Delta terminal. This is a spacious terminal with plenty of light from the floor to ceiling windows giving views of the airport runways/aprons and CitiField and Arthur Ashe Stadium. The walk from gate 75 to gate 97 was rather long. Restrooms are plentiful and clean; however, in some locations they could use more stalls given the number of passengers who traverse this terminal. Dining options are placed conveniently but expensive. Lunch for one cost $45. The airport WiFi is free and very fast."
4901,7640,"Our connection in LGA was from Gate 85B to 85A. Although the area in which my gates were located had not been renovated yet, the area was still pretty well maintained and I was impressed by the recently renovated areas as we taxied to/from the gates."
4902,7641,"I am very impressed with the new LaGuardia airport. I believe you can take public transport there as well as a motorway which goes to the airport. The security was very quick, less than 5 minutes. The terminal was new and clean and looked like it had lots of shops. The AA lounge was pretty good, it had lots of healthy food. It was a balcony looking onto the airport so it lost marks there."
4903,7642,Airport has been improved massively since the renovation. Everything is clean and sleek and works as it should be.
4904,7643,"Solid airport. Busy, but it was neat and efficient which is all I ask for. Only departed out of this airport, never arrived."
4905,7644,This airport has come along way in the last three years. Very open and airy and lots of retail and restaurants. Fantastic new United club as well.
4906,7645,The new Terminal A is nice I guess. Very clean. The bathrooms are nice and the restaurant/store selection is alright. The view is also nice and the seats are too!
4907,7646,Just a quick transfer but nobody told us that we have to pick up our checked in bag and move it by ourselves to the united stand at the luggage retrieval
4908,7647,"The new renovations at EWR terminal C, are amazing. While renovations are minor, the new signage, new seating, and attention to detail and United branding is nice, sleek, and more modern!"
4909,7648,"do not try to make it here from nyc at 12 am without knowing what you are doing, too many curveballs for the next 3 hours of your life"
4910,7649,There was an extremely long line in terminal C for UAL departures but I had TSA Pre-Check so it was fine. I had to transfer terminals for rental car service. The bathrooms were clean and there was a sufficient amount of retail located every few gates.
4911,7650,Terminal A looks great. Nice Premier Access check-in but it's hidden until you really look for it. New security is really just pre-check but you have to take the same old stuff off of you. The concourses go in descending order which make no sense.
4912,7651,"The check in process was smooth, and the security was fast and there weren’t any complications. The transfer from the train station using the Air Train was easy, and wasn’t tedious at all. The airport felt a bit old and outdated, but other than that, I had a great experience!"
4913,7653,"Flying out of Newark's Terminal B was interesting, as it is home to low-cost carriers, international carriers, and domestic carriers. The mix is interesting and therefore makes the terminal experience crowded."
4914,7659,"This is a nice medium sized airport.\, with quick security lines and fast checkin. My only complaint is creature comforts. Hours for amenities are limited."
4915,7660,"Always have a great experience at ORF, as my home airport I only really have problems with security check as it always takes a very long time every-time.. Food options are great for a smaller airport. I have never been to a lounge in the airport. Overall 4.5/5"
4916,7661,Only 1 hour of free WiFi and signs for southwest departure drop-off was a little confusing for someone not from here. Still giving 5 stars for amazing and clean terminal atmosphere and stores
4917,7662,"The best part about flying in or out of Norfolk is how easy it is to get in and out of the airport. It is, however, a small airport and so facilities, particularly in the age of COVID, are rather sparse. There are no lounges, WiFi is spotty, the security checkpoints frequently mix TSA Pre-Chek and regular passengers (ORF was one of the last airports to get Pre-Chek) and the check-in experience can range from one star to five, but is usually quite good."
4918,7666,"At one time, OAK was a great airport. Now, terminal 2 (Southwest) is a piece of crap. There used to be a moving sidewalk to help you get to the far gates (e.g. 29-32). They ripped it out to put in more overpriced restaurants. They also have windows facing the ramp frosted so you can't see the planes."
4919,7667,Compact easy to navigate airport. Much easier and quicker than SFO when flying to the Bay Area. My go to airport in the Bay Area.
4920,7669,Easy Airport. Relatively clean/simple to navigate. Currently there is some construction so concessions/food options are a little more limited. Wifi is decent & free. LOVE the Escape lounge. Main complaint is checked bags always seem slow for an airport of this size.
4921,7670,"Fairly small airport, immigration can be slow. But cheaper to fly to than SFO and takes a similar time to get to the airport."
4922,7671,This was my first time at Oakland International Airport. I would always fly from KSJC or KSFO. My first impression of the airport is really good.
4923,7673,I understand food in airports are expensive but the prices here are too pricey. There was no where for me to sit and wait for the flight.
4924,7674,"Recommend 100% for connection to San Francisco. BART is just $10 to Downtown SF and frequent! I can only speak for security check in Terminal 1, but both times I went through it it was quick and efficient - no hassle. For 32 gates, good food options and handy tech vending machines with headphones etc."
4925,7675,"Oakland, the closest major airport to my home, is great due to it's variety of flights while still being a small and manageable airport. The lines for check-in and security aren't nearly as long as nearby airports like SJC and SFO. The terminal is clean, and the gates are more modern in design, however the ticket counters look quite old. Overall a great airport to fly out of. My one qualm is the lack of retail and food choices available in terminal one. Terminal 2 is completely Southwest, so if you're flying any other airline your food choices will be quite limited unless you trek over to terminal 2 after going through security. There are no food or retail options before security in either terminal"
4926,7676,"Oklahoma city airport is a smaller airport with not many restaurants inside. However, the lines are short in security and the gates are all really close to security. There are not alot of shops here."
4927,7677,Nice airport with very friendly staff. Shame International flights do not fly into here as this hub has a lot to offer.
4928,7678,"Arrival---there is free wifi, its under Boingo Hotspot. Bigger terminal that I had thought. Fast baggage claim. Stopped off at the bathrooom on arrival and suitcase was already on the belt by the time I got there. Many taxis waiting right outside. Departure---fast security. Was at the airport 4:30 AM, the few shops were open at that time, restaurants opened around 5 AM. Once again, free wifi, but for some reason couldn't connect to Facebook... worked well on other sites. Wifi connection probably not as secure as it should be. Taxi from Bricktown to the airport and vice versa costs between $30-$40. Had a 6 AM departure and booked the taxi from the hotel the day before which may have increased the price."
4929,7679,Needs free wifi
4930,7680,New fastback security line is good. But why not free wifi?
4931,7681,Security lines are always to long and no free wifi. Otherwise nice and small
4932,7682,"Acceptable airport that has a decent variety of airlines/destinations. Quick to get to and get through, and easy to get upgraded on flights with any degree of status since the flights are not crowded."
4933,7684,"Very nice airport... plenty of taxis outside with fixed fares to the hotels. Baggage came through quickly. Check-in a breeze and probably the nicest TSA folks at security I've ever dealt with. Great free wifi, but once you get through security check, food options are very limited, atleast in the B Concourse where I arrived and departed."
4934,7685,"The best part about flying out of Omaha is never having to be worried about security lines. You can be through check-in and security after 15 minutes max. Dining options are limited post-security, however."
4935,7686,"The best part about flying out of Omaha is never having to be worried about security lines. You can be through check-in and security after 15 minutes max. Dining options are limited post-security, however."
4936,7687,"Waited over a hour to claim baggage,United have outsourced this airport so service is appalling and contractors shouting at each other on the jet bridge."
4937,7689,Terminal 4 is this bizarre mix of operational efficiency with an appalling lack of selection in retail and restaurant options.
4938,7690,ONT is good alternative option for traveling to the LA area. Its small and there isn't much but it gets the job done. The baggage claim area is a bit to small even for an airport which is small to begin with
4939,7693,"Ontario Airport is nice from the perspective of getting to the airport and going through security (though TSA Precheck was closed when I arrived at 6 pm). Terminal 4, though, is pretty lacking in amenities. At 6:30 pm, all of the restaurants weren't even open."
4940,7694,"ONT is one of the world's most generic airports. ONT is good for flying in and out of due to non-existent security lines, but it only has sub-par food offerings, no-name retail stores, and not much else."
4941,7696,Adequate.
4942,7697,Quick and easy check-in process. Short security lines. Ample seating. Poor food selection.
4943,7698,Orlando Airport is kind of busy airport with long lines to Security. The airport is well Maintenace with several food options. Free WIFI and plenty of Disney stores. Long lines to bathrooms are a pain.
4944,7699,"Avis Car rental is a bit confusing. I saw the name GHATAK, A in display board. But there was no additional info. Finally, got a Chrysler Mini Van."
4945,7701,"As ever, MCO's transit links are terrible so I had to book an external shuttle to get there. The security check is abhorrent and shows no signs of improving, there was an almost 40 minute wait. Sun Country uses the same wing of Terminal B as Air Canada which is decent and the food options are good."
4946,7702,Waited over 3 hours for my bags. I had done pre check and the bags still went to customs and back 5 times.
4947,7703,"Wish they’re was more food offerings and TSA would be modernized. I recommend doing the clear reserve which is free of charge and will save you a ton of time at security. I’m so used to the enhanced TSA machines which are new, efficient, and smooth. These are not and I feel it slows down the process. Plus more physical labor is required having to push the bin down to the metal detector lol."
4948,7704,Terminal A where Spirit has their gates is a lot more crowded and congested than the other terminals.
4949,7705,"Check in was mixed, the staff mainly speak Spanish to each other. So they talk about you in front of you, but won't say anything to you. TSA sucks here, first negative TSA experience."
4950,7706,Super smooth facilities upon arrival but arriving internationally from Terminal C is very tiresome as it involved a very long walk to customs and immigration. You collect your bag before you go to the CBP. The system was completely automated.
4951,7707,Orlando airport is super huge and easy to get lost in me and my family have only been there once and it took us forever just to get to the Disney buses so try not to get lost
4952,7708,"Honestly MCO isn’t a bad airport if you have pre-check, but I only give them 4 stars because they don’t have liquid pour-out stations near/at security, so you have to pour your drink in the atrium plants. ????"
4953,7709,"Check in, security- all need big improvements, terrible slovly miving queues everywhere. Staff is extremely slow and little helpful....frankly speaking, didn't expect like that....downgrade from 2022 is significant....."
4954,7710,"When I got there for my return flight, I got there by Lyft to Terminal C. The lounge is good, but I can't say for immigration/baggage claim as I did a domestic flight with a carry-on."
4955,7711,"I think in my honest opinion that this airport is one of the beast airport to fly out of if possible. although it has some issues with wifi and food services, i think this is a great airport!"
4956,7712,"Orlando-Sanford actually surprised me as it used to be really bad, but with renovations and modernization came a better airport. The new tiles floor looks great and the new exhibit is really cool. I wish there was more color to the airport however and that there were more dining options."
4957,7715,"My flight lands and I deboard the airplane at terminal 3 A, when I got off I was expecting to walk directly into the terminal, but I guess that's not the case at Orlando/Sanford, I walked through 7 doors in order to get to the main terminal, I've been to a ton of airports before and I've never had to do this. When I was walking through the airport waiting for the shuttle to pick me up I went to one of the stores to get something to drink, nothing had price tags on it, and when I asked the lady how much something costs she said ""I don't know"", it was $3.75 for a normal bottle of coke, if I got it on the plane it was $2."
4958,7716,"Getting to the airport was easy enough. Long term parking was close and convenient but expensive ($14 per day with no cap). Terminal was pretty crowded. Food options not great, particularly bad upstairs past security. Wifi exists but not functional with crowds present. Will probably fly through here again given it will be only decent option for a specific flight, but would not choose it if other options were available."
4959,7718,"Overall, what this airport lacks in terminal food options and shopping, it makes up for in convenience. I can get from parking my car to my gate in under 10 minutes on a good day. Check in online and save time at the counter, though. Those lines seem really long every time I come through."
4960,7720,"Orlando Sanford features a lounge, with many facilities. Easy to navigate. However, some boarding screens were inaccurate. The friendly staff were able to help us out, though."
4961,7722,"A very very very nice airport, because most of the airport is outside, which is very different. There isn't that much to do after security, and this airport is barely ever too busy, so security is fine."
4962,7724,This was my first time transiting through PSP and was amazed at the airport's layout. The mostly outdoors layout was nice too.
4963,7725,"Great boutique airport! Grass post-security to stretch out on and catch the last few rays of sun; much of the airport is open-air; modern design with updated restaurants and facilities. Small, but nice!"
4964,7728,"An amazing airport for how small and how much traffic it gets, but getting bags checked is very hectic for a small airport, even EWR was faster with even more people! But still is an amazing airport!"
4965,7729,Easy to get rental cars.
4966,7730,Security is slower that ATL
4967,7731,"Not been on a UK to domestic US transfer for a while, really surprised, 20 mins from disembarking I was happily esconced in the Admirals Club!"
4968,7732,"I may be a little bit biased due to Philly airport, but I do believe it is a very nice airport for domestic travel, especially along the East Coast and I hope more international carriers from Europe start flying here."
4969,7733,Smooth airport. No security. You can just walk out. Taxis are available as soon as you walk out. Bridges connect to the terminal’s parking garage to the terminal itself. Nice airport! Great shop and restaurant selection too.
4970,7734,Let's just say you ain't gonna be hungry ever. Philly Airport is jam packed with services and food places. It's not massive and is easy to traverse.
4971,7735,Leave time for connections.. if you come in Top of terminal A its a long walk just to shuttle.. If you have to walk to Terminal 4 its a HIKE not a walk :-)
4972,7737,"If you think you should be there by whenever, be there an half an hour earlier, less people at check in, open space at gates, time to walk around. Just be early"
4973,7738,"Not too crowded. Shuttle took me from one terminal to the other. Security slightly outdated, had to take all laptops/ipads/drones etc. out of bags. Easy entry with Visa (took about 5-10 minutes in total)."
4974,7740,"The Avis Rental Car Facility was so poorly managed. We waited for two hours in the cold sitting night. Watch out for Karen’s though, because they were also a part cause. Two ladies stood there at the desk demanding a Chrysler minivan. They were offered a Honda minivan, the only type they had at the time (9:00 pm), and threw a tantrum like a toddler."
4975,7741,"Small airport, can make for some longer wait times while going through security, but staff are more friendly and parking is drastically easier than somewhere like EWR or JFK."
4976,7746,Clear understaffed and stuck in the middle of the process to upgrade people's profile ... had to go regular TSA-Pre
4977,7747,"Good airport. Everything is centrally located, making access from the concourses simple. Terminal is clean, and the baggage claim didn’t take long at all. Pre clearance was allowed so I didn’t have to go through customs. Lots of clear windows to spot planes from. However I would suggest adding some more seating to the B gates. Some people were sitting on the floor considering how busy it got, when I deplaned."

4979,7749,"Very cool airport, with great and modern architecture. Lots of retail and services, such as a museum. Very clean and efficient."
4980,7750,This flight was done during the mask mandate in sky harbor and was a pain to get through the airport and trying to get food was hard as everything was closed.
4981,7751,"For the time I was there, which wasn't that long, it was fine. Check-in and security was fine, but would have been better if we didn't get dropped off at the wrong place. Getting to the airport is really easy, with all the road options in the Phoenix metro area. The terminals had good food options. I remember there being a Starbucks and some bar restaurants in the terminal I was in. There was good enough Wifi and plenty of lounge space. Baggage claim is nice. Overall, a nice airport."
4982,7752,"Was very spacious and clean. Was a bit of a walk from the end of terminal F. Staff were very helpful, and kind"
4983,7753,"Overall very happy with Phoenix Terminal 3. Everything was very fast, food options are good and wifi is free."
4984,7754,It’s good. The only reason I would give it this rating is because there is nothing special about it.
4985,7755,"Sky harbor most days is an easy and quick airport to get through, TSA is always pretty fast and they are actually surprisingly nice. If you're lucky enough to fly through terminal 3, definitely grab some Shake Shack! Make sure you have plenty of time before your flight though as they are often quite busy."
4986,7756,TSA PreCheck today was so slow. I think the one guy manning the belt entry into the x-ray had a crush on the girl reading the x-ray. He kept talking to her and walking to where she was while folks standing in the snail line were waiting on the little baskets to empty pockets. No biggie though.
4987,7757,"Was in a bit of a rush, but great airport to do so. The tram came frequently and there is little distance to cover"
4988,7758,A bit outdated to be honest but very clean and lots of dining/shopping options and friendly staff. Also worth noting you can go airside to shop/dine without a boarding pass via MyPITPass
4989,7759,"Very easy to navigate, easy to get to the car rentals from baggage claim area. Just curious to see how the airport will be when the new terminal is completed."
4990,7760,Big airport with small volume. Old and needs updating. It is also about 22 miles from Pittsburgh and the people that work there are strange.
4991,7761,"Clean with very friendly staff. My only complaint is being from Pittsburgh, most of the airport is somewhat outdated and could use some modernization."
4992,7762,Great airport and will get better once renovations are completed! It is currently however sad to see the airport in almost abandoned state after its glory days!
4993,7763,Pittsburgh international airport is definitely one of my favorites. Has absolutely anything you need and most of the time security is a breeze
4994,7765,"Amazing airport in my mind, all the times I've flown through it security has been a breeze and an efficient ramp team to get the planes out in time!"
4995,7767,"Portland overall currently is a nice airport. As of December 2023, they are remodeling the airport. It takes a while to get to concourse C, but you get to walk through a cool area. There is also plenty of food options in concourse C, and in E. Getting to the airport takes a while from the western Portland metro area. Check-in is normally not busy during the day, and the last time I was there, security was excellent. There is also plenty of lounge space throughout, with a cool little theater in concourse C."
4996,7768,"The airport is easy to reach, and inside the terminal there are nice restaurants and shops. Overall the airport is clean and not too crowded."
4997,7769,"Smooth check-in and entrance thru security. Good wifi and fairly priced food, water fountains are available."
4998,7770,"The Portland Airport is easy to get to and the traffic, while busy is fairly controlled and orderly. I didn't have to wait in security long due to having Precheck, but the regular line seemed to be short and moving smoothly."
4999,7771,"Portland Airport is usually a nice airport to visit from time to time. However, it is frustrating for that one person that needs to go to another terminal as you will need to go through security again! other than that, It is a pretty nice airport to fly into. Probably stressful for people who arrive for the first time. But Hey! At least it's not SeaTac right? I do not normally do anyhting except for stare out the window onto the apron and watch the airport operations. However Wifi is really good. The airport has nice, clean bathrooms as well. If your in Concourse E you do not have many choices for food and if you would like McDonalds, you have to go through security again. So overall, Good airport, bad setup while construction happens."
5000,7772,"Very nice airport with WiFi kindly stretching out to the parking garages. The same parking garages that overlook the runways quite nicely. The Alaska Airlines Express Lounge at PDX was very, very nice! Happy I got to destress there!"
5001,7773,"Doggone good airport, especially as you can get up on the parking garages to do some plane spotting. Very nice."
5002,7775,PDX is an awesome airport! Some major renovations happening now but no problems moving thru the terminal. Can't wait to go back!
5003,7776,"Nice airport, but it's hard to get from the airport to MAX easily. I cringe at trying to wayfind around PDX."
5004,7777,"The airport is so easy compared to say BOS. The largest downside in my option is the lackluster transit connectivity. There is a shuttle bus to the Train/Bus transit hub near Portland and the airport is connected to the Greater Portland bus network so this is more of a critique of the city's transit than the airport. If you're driving, it is very close to the shopping mall in South Portland and Congress Street in downtown Portland"
5005,7778,"This airport was nice, but it did not have very many plugins for charges, which made being in the airport for long difficult."
5006,7779,Awesome new terminal
5007,7781,"Modern, sleek design. Very quick to get out!"
5008,7783,"This airport is a true travel gem and is consistently name among the best small airports in the USA. Conde Nast Traveler readers named it among the top 10 airports in the world. Shops and eateries that were shuttered because of Covid have now reopened. The airport is in the process of adding more amenities and concessions. The newly renovated bathrooms are amazing. They're brightly lit and significant improvement over the pre-existing bathrooms. The sinks have hand dryers built-in, toilet seats that automatically dispense a fresh plastic cover, longer stall doors, and fresh flowers are part of the new look. Security was a breeze. There was no line and I walked right up to the TSA counter and cleared security in less than 5 minutes. The distances from the security area to either end of the terminal are very manageable. The free WiFi is fast and worked flawlessly."
5009,7784,"Fantastic airport, compact and very easy to navigate. Excellent public transport links and plenty of natural light"
5010,7785,Baggage claim said on the plane and the monitors that baggage claim 1. They ended up dropping it on 2 and not telling anyone. But it was a quick fix
5011,7786,A Better option than Boston Logan if you are lucky enough to have a direct flight. Food Options are weak if you have a late flight. Quiet and simple are the real plus.
5012,7787,"A nice, if somewhat small airport. The check-In Area is surprisingly small and cramped, and the airside and gates are a bit on the small side as well. What's more, it is obvious that the airport was only recently refitted for international travel, with limited duty-free shopping available, and the ""international"" gates added in with copious amounts of drywall. Decent Amount of eateries, although their smell seems to permeate the entire terminal."
5013,7788,"Nice airport for it´s size. Big and bright ddeparture hall, only the arrival hall seems a little small from time to time"
5014,7789,"This airport is a great alternative to Logan, and New York. There is a train station soley dedicated to the Airport, one like that of Londons Heathrow. Connects to major hubs like ChigagoMidway and O'Hare, EWR, CLT, and others. Starting up are international services. In the summer, you can fly to Frankfurt non-stop twice a week on Condor airlines. Year round service to Praia, Cape Verde is available on TACV Cabo Verde Airlines. Thesee are both budget airlines, which would be cheaper then flying our of other aiports. They are currently working on expanding their runways and upgrading safety features on the runway,to accommodate coast to coast, and transatlantic flights. This expansion is scheduled to be completed at the end of 2017. T.F Green is in the tall with Aer Lingus, and having flights to Shannon, for both passengers and cargo. They are looking to secure A once again, as they already have; Delta, Southwest, JetBlue, TACV, Condor, U.S. Airways, Cape Air and United. There are small lines, and one gate dedicated to international flights. There is a full service TGIF, as well as 2 dunking donuts. What a great airport to fly out of. It is really getting great upgrades."
5015,7791,"It was a good flight to Seattle, but I would wish that rdu would add one more flight on delta to Seattle so we have options"
5016,7792,"Pretty easy airport to get around. Decently clean, updated, bathrooms were great. Security took a decent bit of time to get through, but kept moving."
5017,7793,"RDU is my home airport. Great facility and friendly people. They are underway on a major expansion now in 2023. Getting in and out will become more tricky soon. Otherwise, RDU is always a pleasant experience."
5018,7794,"My home airport, cannot give it 1,2,3, or 4 ✨. I think it is very good! IDK 'bout the WiFi though."
5019,7795,"It's a rather quiet, clean and new terminal. It's quieter than Charlotte. The AA lounge disappoints because it does not view the aircraft and is quite small. Leaving the airport public transport is unreliable and Uber doesn't work. Lyft took 30ms."
5020,7796,"Really nice and convenient airport. Didn't get any issue with long lines or anything like that. Maybe it was because of the time, but first impression was very good"
5021,7797,RDU is a great airport to fly out of. Terminal 1 is a little bland in terms of things in there like shops and resources. The waiting area by the gate gets full quickly so I advise to get there early. Otherwise everything was great
5022,7798,The RDU team was nice enough to celebrate the inaugural flight as best they could on their limited covid budget and had a few free items and cookies for all the passengers.
5023,7799,The airport moves quickly and with little hassle. The amenities are clean and the dining options delicious.
5024,7800,"Getting to the airport was not much of a challenge at all. Even though it was very early in the morning, everything was still easy to get to. Check in was quick, security was quick and thorough and the line was fairly short. I recommend traveling in the early morning when airport traffic is to a minimum. WiFi was a bit spotty, but overall, RDU is a great place to fly into and out of."
5025,7807,Reno Tahoe is an amazing airport and it was so cool. Security was easy and the food wasn't overpriced at all.
5026,7808,Reno has a great airport. As it is a small airport I expected it to be bad but the airport was great! It was nice and clean and the signage was good. 5 star airport!
5027,7809,"If you don't have pre-check - be prepared for a LONG wait...looked to be well over an hour on Friday, March 12 at 3:00 PM. Fortunately, we had precheck, but I bet a ton of people missed their flights!"
5028,7810,"The Escape Lounge at Reno/Tahoe Airport is outstanding. Nice service, good food, comfortable. It is small but I've not yet experienced it being crowded."
5029,7816,"For us being a smaller city, our facility is absolutely impressive and really well laid-out and easy to navigate. With multiple options and different airlines, getting around here is very simple."
5030,7817,Security check and check-in was fast and efficient. The lines were not long for anything at all. The waiting area for boarding was a bit crowded but nothing bad about the place.
5031,7818,"I like Rochester's airport. For a city the size of Rochester, their airport is actually kind of impressive. It is very nice and clean and I love the silver metal throughout. It just feels sleek. Transit though is an issue. RTS is awful bus service wise. Get a Lyft or Uber instead. Security is odd to me though as they're like a generic knock off of TSA. It's really really weird."
5032,7819,"Security is very fast, and easy. Tye terminal facilities are also very clean. There, however, aren't many food choices."
5033,7820,Fabulous airport. Security is easy and Dunkin Doughnuts line is always short :) Perfect for an early morning flight!
5034,7821,The airport gates through B4 and B22 are just all in one building and it's not very long so it's a pretty nice airport not a long walk to your next gate.
5035,7822,"SMF is a beautiful, clean, and well-functioning airport. It's exactly what you want in a ""smaller"" airport."
5036,7823,Baggage claim took about 1 hour and 20 minutes for bags to get on the belt with no reasons given by United or SMF.
5037,7824,Very spacious airport and you get through very quickly. Easy to navigate although the food was very expensive.
5038,7825,"TSA Pre at this airport isn't the fastest. At least the time I flew out & used it, it took a long time to get thru."
5039,7826,"KSMF/SMF terminal B is a great, updated airport. From my experience early morning security does seem to be more crowded. But after around 10ish it does seem to be extremely quick. The rest of the terminal is great with plenty of food choices. Most seats have power outlets in them, and both ends of the terminal are great for plane spotting. There is wifi that works fine. In my opinion it is a great airport for the semi busy, mostly domestic flights it serves."
5040,7827,"Not too confusing, pretty empty most of the time actually. The check in desk crew is generally pretty nice and fast for what goes on. Sometimes you get the occasional slow boarding, but it doesn't happen often."
5041,7828,I’m biased because it’s tyne airport closest but it has its flaws while there’s no BK in the terminal B there is some options. Seats are good but nothing to praise about.
5042,7829,The rental car shuttle is horrible. It takes forever to get to your rental cars from the airport. The overall airport is clean and they are working on some renovations. Food selection is slim in terminal A. No lounges.
5043,7830,"There's no traditional lounge in this airport. Security check was awful, super long lane compare to such size airport. Wifi is free but speed and signal strength is really bad."
5044,7834,"SLC is a GREAT airport. Easy to get around, fast baggage claim (even with skis), close to the city and mountains."
5045,7836,Absolutely love this airport! The views and how modern it was was amazing! Only issue I had was how long it takes to walk through terminals.
5046,7842,"Long walk between terminals, be advised! It is true walking but there are walkilators to assist with the commute between those two terminals. Not much for lounges."
5047,7843,"The airport was/is still being further developed, but I liked it a lot, especially the ease of transfer in the same terminal."
5048,7845,"The airport is very far from the city,but the installations are very good and comfy.There are many places to go eating and the security check is fast."
5049,7846,Landed here so it was easy to arrive. I hope it's easy to get gere from the city but never been outside.
5050,7847,"We had a diversion into Dallas due to bad weather. When we got to San Antonio, it wasn’t even wet. Really sunny!!!"
5051,7848,"Getting to the airport was really quick and you just park and get inside and it was really quick. Check in had NO line and depending this was the weekend after 4th of July in 2022… it was amazing. Security was also quick and overall everything was good. Once you pass security into the terminal there was a huge crowd getting on a delayed flight which I cannot complain. The o Lu food is Starbucks and they have retail that have snacks but ok. Anyways, a very good airport."
5052,7849,The terminal was terminal B and I have no complaints at all. :) CHECK IN THOUGH IS A WHOLE NOTHER STORY... the lines were so long...
5053,7850,"This was my first time travelling through SAT. Smaller airport with modern amenities. I was happy to see that SAT had both CLEAR & TSA Pre-Check; this made getting through security a breeze. I was disappointed there was no Delta Sky Club, but there seemed to be plenty of food options inside the A Terminal. Overall, SAT is a nice, clean airport that I would not hesitate to fly through again."
5054,7851,"San Antionio airport is small and easy to find your terminal and food. Getting to the airport there’s two spots, drop off and pickup. There’s always a line to pick up people so I would recommend telling the person picking you up to go to the drop off section since there isn’t that many people. Wifi can be slow at sometimes and fast at sometimes. Personally I don’t like airport wifi’s due to their security. There’s ok food choices to choose from and if your in a rush it would be perfect. TSA checkpoint is small and easy, there can be a line and if there is they normally run slow. Baggage claim I can care less there’s only 3 baggage claim convaour belts."
5055,7852,"San Antonio is a really great airport for beginners, it is small so you can't get lost easily. Everything is spread out, very clean airport! Personally I would pick people up from the drop-off because downstairs (pickup) is way too over crowded. TSA has a small little thing but that doesn't defeat them going fast! Wi-fi is alright, sometimes it can be slow and you have a lot of food options to choose from!"
5056,7853,"Sometimes the stores are not open in the afternoon, probably because the rush is usually in the morning. The only StarBucks in Terminal A was closed down and so if you want StarBucks, you have to leave security and go back in to Terminal B. American Airlines Recently bought some gates on Terminal A, they usually fly out of Terminal B. So make sure to check which Terminal you plane is leaving from before you get to the airport."
5057,7854,Security was pretty good I got through in 5 mins. Bathrooms and airport were very clean. Masks were well enforced and the chairs are pretty comfortable at the terminals
5058,7856,"SAN has improved since 1993 when I first started flying in and out of it on a regular basis. It is still catching up to some of the newer or larger airports around the US, but when the new Terminal 1 is completed, it should be on par with those US airports."
5059,7858,"I had about a couple hours between flights when I connected here, so had a chance to wander around the premises a bit -- Sleek, modern facility with plenty of space and ample food options to choose from"
5060,7859,Terminal 1 is old and run down. They are in the process of building a new terminal 1 so hopefully the experience will be better in the future.
5061,7860,"Very easy and simple to navigate, but can get congested with several flights leaving at the same time."
5062,7862,"Very convenient shuttle to Old Town trolley station. Good landside food & retail choices. (Southwest terminal): Not a pleasant place to wait. Surprisingly limited food / retail options, lack of seating, and crowded. Maybe the Alaska Air terminal is better."
5063,7863,"Getting to the airport was easy however depends on time of day and if you are lucky are not when it comes to the Terminal 1 construction. Checked in at home, security was fairly quick and the new terminal 2 is as always a fantastic airport terminal! Got there at the time of boarding so couldn't try out other things so 5 out of 5!"
5064,7864,Decent airport but room for improvement - such as need for better transit. WiFi OK. Security very fast and good. But the restaurant didn't have milkshakes.
5065,7867,"Getting to the airport is quick and convenient. The G gates have a rail station connected to it, so it was quick and easy to get the the airport."
5066,7868,"San Fransisco..... where do I start Arrivals has metal toilets and is bad condition, departures is a bit better. TSA Was quick smallish terminal no big food companies either."
5067,7869,"If you fly with united and intend to planespot, you should hope that you don't get stuck in the back gates where you can't see the runways or anything else."
5068,7871,"It was bad experience that inspite of UA's Hub Airport, check-in counter has many wating people, but only 3 staffs."
5069,7872,"San Francisco International Airport is a great airport to fly out of and into, with modern facilities and all of the essential items an airport must have. Please note, however, that I am heavily biased due to the fact that it is one of my hometown airports."
5070,7873,"San Francisco is a great airport, the security doesn't take too long and after there is plenty of restaurants to eat at, and there is even a museum.It is very easy to find your way around after security. I recommend you bring a jacket because it gets very cold in there."
5071,7874,Qatar Airways check-in was too long due to their carry on policy. Differs from other airlines and typical carry on bags would have to be checked in
5072,7875,"The signage at the airport is a bit confusing, I thought that flying to Canada you would be dropped off at the international terminal but I was wrong. It was quite the walk from the international terminal to the transborder terminal."
5073,7876,United terminal- Nice restaurant with decent selection and not overpriced. Spacious terminal however many USB charging sockets were inoperable
5074,7877,"The baggage claim area can be confusing because the signage isn’t very good. Make sure you walk around the whole area to ensure your find the right carousel. Also, if you come late, the airline might have taken your baggage off the carousel and put it in their baggage claim office. No one tells you this, so you wont know where your bags are until you check."
5075,7878,"The Club SJC at A15 was phenomenal. Truly a club/lounge experience. Hospitable staff, great food, great customer service, and efficiency with service."
5076,7879,"Overall, San Jose is a pretty great airport (and my home airport that I fly from a lot so theres gonna be bias here), but it's Wi-Fi continues to be a disappointment. The baggage claim also took a while to start sending baggage, and there wasn't anywhere to sit while waiting, and the Baggage Claim wasn't quite organized."
5077,7880,"The security check lines were about normal for this time, around 15-30 minutes in line depending on how fast the people in front were. Since I was not traveling with any luggage, and my only carry-on was a small purse, and I had no pockets in my clothing, the whole check-in and security process was very quick. Overall, San Jose is maintaining its fast service, though the Wi-Fi is, as usual, quite unsatisfactory."
5078,7881,"OVerall service at the airport was great. I did land at about 10pm at night, which means there weren't that many places open nearby. The baggage claim had a short wait, but it was pretty fast overall. However, my suitecase did lose a wheel somewhere during the flight. Leaving the airport was pretty cold because the San Jose weather at night is really cold, but the weather in Hawaii is warm. DO: Prepare extra layers of clothing if you are flying this route at night. Be prepared for temperature differences."
5079,7882,AA Ticket counters were on other side of terminal which required taking escalator past security checkpoint and back down
5080,7883,"The terminal facilities run about 3/4 to 1 mile in length, yet the designers of the terminal did not make it wide enough so that moving walkways could be implemented to speed the process of getting from security at gate 25 to in the far flung reaches of the terminal. There is also no direct mass transit link at the airport. You must take a bus to a light rail station, or take a bus to a train station. The shared ride facilities have improved, but it is still a cluster when the airport is busy."
5081,7884,"Super convenient Hertz drop-off procedure and then took the airport bus to Terminal A. All seamless regarding checked bag, boarding pass, TSA, etc."
5082,7886,"Great airport, very clean, modern and spacious. Much easier to use than Oakland or San Francisco and a lot quieter too. Great selection of shops and restaurants and free wifi throughout airport is good. Close to downtown San Jose and an airport I will continue to use in the future now international flights have been added (e.g from London)"
5083,7890,"Good enough for an airport of it’s size. They have good seats, it’s not too busy, and definitely easy to get through."
5084,7891,"Deplaning you are instructed to walk right to baggage claim, but the claim is in a different terminal to your left1"
5085,7892,"John Wayne Airport is personally my favorite airport. It is a small 21 gate airport in the southern suburbs of Los Angles. The airport has is modern and clean with lots of places to eat that are very delicious. It also does not get too crowded making for an easy, fun experience. The airport also has a small area next to gate 21 that is great for plane spotting. All in all, if you fly into or out of John Wayne International Airport, you will love it."
5086,7893,"Very fast and friendly service. Even TSA. No lines at all, not crowded. Good choice for dining. Plenty of seats and perfect location for OC. Love this airport! Would recommend it to everybody. It is one of the best airports I've seen so far."
5087,7894,My home airport. Easy to get going at this airport. Also I love the 'rocket' take off they do too.
5088,7895,Much easier to use than LAX. Actually used surface streets and took only 15 minutes from my sister's apartment!
5089,7897,"Facilities are better than average, clean and well-staffed. It was SNA rush hour but security line was still efficient."
5090,7905,"Nice, small airport. Quick movement through baggage claim, security and terminal in general. Friendly staff throughout"
5091,7906,"Cool little fish tanks and murals of manatees. Very close to Anna Marie Island, and treasure island, not far from Tampa or siesta keys. Pretty tinyn but immediate beach feel, friendly staff."
5092,7907,convenient airport. a little dated but the convenience makes up for it.
5093,7911,Food is good but it's closed all the time. It angers me that the food choices are closed all the time. Good views though.
5094,7912,"SEA is notorious for long TSA lines if you don't have PreCheck, so plan ahead. Delta had just one SkyClub at the time which luckily is large to accommodate everyone, but adding a second will be an improvement. It doesn't feel like a Delta hub in that the Delta area is cramped and outdated; hopefully they invest more in the Delta experience there going forward."
5095,7914,"The Seattle airport is one of the fastest growing airports around the world so of course it was busy, it was easy getting around the airport but I did not like are two hour delay going to Hawaii."
5096,7915,"I normally don’t experience any issues but the only issue is getting through the security check points at certain times of the day especially during the holidays, the Pre Check lines is normally quicker but it has been longer at times."
5097,7917,preaty good airport the only good thing about SEA is it has parking lot for a litle bit of $$$ and a suttle from them
5098,7920,"Old airport, looking like it needs an update. getting around the airport is fine. Baggage claim is very overcrowded, and takes a long time."
5099,7926,Only 10 minutes from my home - easy in and out via taxi or Uber. Excellent Car Rental - no need for a connecting shuttle or bus. Minimal eats but this is not a hub so most folks don't linger.
5100,7927,"I recommend... but only for English speaking travelers. No service for other languages, except for Spanish."
5101,7928,"Beautiful airport, though rent- a- car is very stressful. Also-- Slava Ukraini! Glory to Ukraine! Who's with me?"
5102,7929,Luggage from international flight on Eurowings Discover from FRA was mistakenly brought to domestic belt
5103,7930,Did not need to take devices and food out at TSA pre check and lots of food options! Very clean and bathroom where also clean!
5104,7931,"Amazing Airport, very open, clean and huge check in area. TSA was very kind and quick. Short walk to the gates. But, make sure you know what concourse your gate is in, because it looks like there is different TSA stations for the concourses. WHile you are there, take a look at the Western Global planes parked on the field."
5105,7932,"Almost drove to the airport for a full hour from Marco Island, but regardless everything there was good except theres a burger king at concorce B, and my flight was at concorce D, why does there have to be TSA's at every concorse?"
5106,7933,"Didnt do anything Airside except walk to the baggage claim, the baggage claim conveyors were huge and big. Takes a person enough time to get their baggage."
5107,7934,A wonderful little Airport
5108,7935,Excellent
5109,7936,So we have a lot of trouble finding a place to fill up our water bottles. It's a pretty nice little airport it had this weird toaster plane I don't know why it had that but that was kind of cool to see the toast and the plane.
5110,7938,"Awesome airport and definitely wish more airports were like GEG. Good views of flight ops, Starbucks right next to the gate, and some quiet areas throughout the airport."
5111,7939,"Prety old airport, some of the same shops and layout as the 1980s . . except for the security lines."
5112,7940,Good regional airport. Well it is quite busy. It is and has everything you'd expect from a airport of this size. Food and amenities are good and it is not very busy. Also only one stars on lounges because well... you should know why.
5113,7941,College town. bars close early . The airport is really nice but small. Don't sit near the windows during the afternoon sun. It gets a little intense
5114,7942,"I love departing and arriving out of Spokane. After living in Los Angeles and traveling out of LAX for 20 years, Spokane is a HUGE relief. It’s small, easy to navigate and the people are all very nice. TSA is a breeze and generally the workers are some of the friendliest and easy going anywhere even at 6:00 AM, when I usually fly out for work."
5115,7943,"This is a great small airport! Easy to get to the airport, there is never (or almost never) a ton of people. The crew that works in the airport is really kind."
5116,7945,"Good little airport with decent service by the major airlines to the hubs. Easy to get to and through. Nice facility with room to spread out, a good coffee shop and restaurant. Three stars overall due to somewhat limited airline service. SGF is an alternative airport for travelling to southwest Missouri and northwest Arkansas, and even for northeast OKlahoma and southeast Kansas. It's similar to XNA (Bentonville) in terms of service mainly to hubs, but XNA has more destinations and a bit more frequency. XNA is harder to get to than SGF is, though. Both facilities are about the same in terms of features and amenities."
5117,7946,"I love Springfield's little airport. It's close to where I live, and they make it easy to park and get into the airport. Super nice facilities, friendly staff, and always on time!"
5118,7947,"Nice little airport. Not too busy. Shops and places to grab snacks and food were open at 6:30 AM. Easy check-in, really nice TSA folks at security. Free wifi. The airport only has 10 gates but it felt very spacious with a lot of seats. Took an airport shuttle to and from airport but there were taxis waiting outside the terminal (front door are for passenger pick up/drop off only), for taxis and shuttles, go out the side door marked taxis, buses & shuttles)"
5119,7949,"Bathrooms were a bit dirty and unkept, and in need of repairs. Could use some more food choices as lines get quite long and seats fill up fast."
5120,7950,Food options are fine in terms of variety. A few places to charge devices. Airport overall is a bit out dated. Windows are tinted which can make planes potting a pain.
5121,7952,The majors are in T1 and WN in T2. Both terminals are served by light rail that takes you to Forest Park and the Gateway Arch. There is free WiFi in the terminals. Food and retail close by 1700 on Saturdays.
5122,7953,"From my experiences with KSTL/STL, I can say that the airport is definitely dated. My main complaint is the horrendous baggage claim area. There are 2 baggage carousels for the E? Terminal for the large amount of flights it is extremely crowded. The place is loud as the ceiling is some metal thing that I’m guessing the baggage belt sits on. The roof looks like it will collapse with all the stains, holes and other oddities it has. The rest of the airport is an average airport in my opinion. It isn’t the best for plane spotting as the seats are not facing the windows, therefor the seat backs are against the windows so it isn’t the most comfortable thing to do. Food is average. I just feel that everything needs to be updated."
5123,7954,"St. Louis lambert intl airport is one of the better airports I’ve been to. No lack of amenities, shops and facilities you may need."
5124,7955,"STL is a small airport, which makes it a great place to check-in and start your trip via a connection through a hub."
5125,7956,"I love this airport. It is easy to navigate though the parking lot, and get a parking spot. Getting checked in is easy, and depending on what terminal you are in it is easy to get to your gate. It took me a little while to get through security. Overall it is a great airport."
5126,7962,"Important note, the main runway is closed as of August 17th so your flight will likely take a different flight path over the southern Syracuse area which add about 5 minutes of air time. The main runway should be open around mid-September"
5127,7963,"This airport is truly the best. not too big, not too small. However the dining options are limited"
5128,7964,"SYR is very easy to drive to/from. Located outside Syracuse. Facilities in terminal are basic, eatery is very pricey. Good wifi in general. Airport is near end of major overhaul in main check-in section."
5129,7966,"Tallahassee airport is a very simple airport to get through. The airport staff is nice and willing to help you. Sadly there are no lounges, but there is good WiFi"
5130,7968,"TLH has been remodeling the terminal. For a small airport, has nice retail both before and after security. Does have fre wifi"
5131,7970,"Getting to the airport - Alright just some traffic. Clear navigation to departure drops, arrival etc. Check-in - Americans Self Check In system was easy and helped us check our bags quickly. Security Check - A little congested in airside F (alot faster in other terminals) but it was alright and clear. Terminal Facilities - Bathrooms are clean and terminal is cool as in temperature. WiFi - Fast WiFi and easy to connect to. Food and Retail services - here was a diverse selection of food options and seating before boarding! Lounge - Cannot rate. I never went into it."
5132,7971,"I might be a little biased because this is my home airport, but truly this is a good air port. The biggest downside in my opinion is the lounges, because there's only two. American and delta. The biggest downside is all business and first international travelers are squeezed into this one AA lounge. If you don't care about lounges this is your airport."
5133,7972,tampa is a clean airport and although i only had a 45 minute layover it looked like a very nice airport
5134,7973,"Honestly an amazing airport. Wifi worked great for passing the time, and the terminal seating was surprisingly comfortable. Really good options for shopping and dining, with seating being just the same. Overall amazing."
5135,7974,"Very good looking and had a very nice atmosphere. Shuttle is fun and fast. Very nice air conditioning, which is a must here. Baggage claim took a long time, but it was still good."
5136,7975,It was a very nice airport but I have to rate it 4 stars due to a interaction with a jet blue employee
5137,7976,"Baggage claim was really fast. Customs was fast. I was refused the Lounge, even though I had the status, but the AA People working there are really nice. Overall very good ."
5138,7978,Not allowed to walk from the C Concourse to the baggage claim anymore; Tram was very busy in between all areas.
5139,7980,Very nice airport and very close to city center. Nice large chair to sit on and relax while waiting for your flight. Very quick security lines and check in procedure.
5140,7981,"overall nice, quaint little airport. only has 6 gates and not many flights today, so security process was quick and easy. agents nice and worked with us well. boarding easy as well and gate agent also nice."
5141,7982,"Fantastic airport, small and very quiet. Excellent internet coverage and a local cafeteria with high quality foods. TSA is also very polite and kind in this airport. Overall this is a great airport if you're into peace and quiet, their addition of an outside garden you can visit if you're behind security is also a great plus in my opinion."
5142,7984,"Traveler-friendly Airport. Not too many big, easy to get in and get out. Mexican Customs quick and friendly."
5143,7985,Terminal needs a renovation and food services that take multiple forms of payment. Also less glare in the windows ruining photos of F-16s taking off and landing on training missions.
5144,7986,OK airport but needs more frequent transit and seems in need of a renovation to my WA ST eyes. But that's me.
5145,7987,"Tucson Airport is a little far for those of us without a car. You have to take a car or Lyft/Uber to get there, since the buses are unreliable/infrequent."
5146,7988,"Live music in baggage claim was cool, the American Bag Service Office quickly was able to address my issue (damaged bag). Uber is very hard to find here, the app says ""past bag claim 7"" but when they don't mention is you have to go upstairs to departures to find your Uber, had to pay extra because it took me more than 2 minutes to find the driver."
5147,7989,"Love flying out of TIA, and it's one of the more modern airports in the country. Check-in and security are pretty quick. Food selection is limited, but that's what you'd expect from a regional airport."
5148,7992,It was fine even though I was in there for an hour. If your flying out commercially stay at the airport hotels and you can walk to plane spot!
5149,7993,Nice small airport. No free WiFi though
5150,7997,"Long journey through the airport for PRMs. Efficient assistance service, but poorly coordinated. Polaris lounge very good for their buffets and the drink/bar offer."
5151,7998,Decent. Love the old architecture in the check-in area but the D & C concourses need some improvement from the present box-yness.
5152,7999,"Very nice airport, good facilities and lots of food choices. They even have a chick-fil-a in the international terminal. Most planes leave on time but sometimes their will be delays. Check-in, security, and customs are usually pretty good but it depends when you are at the airport. The airport also has multiple different forms of transportation for the airport to Washington D.C."
5153,8001,"Amazing, staff was funny, check in and security was quick, even at 10 PM with 2 flight crews and an a380 worth of passengers, lounges were abundent, but all were closed. wifi was fast, and there were many stores, but all were closed at 10."
5154,8002,"Washington Dulles (IAD) Airport Review: CHECK IN: We checked in for our United Airlines flight. It was quick and smooth and there wasn't that much of a crowd. SECURITY: The lines were quite long, even at the TSA PreCheck checkpoint. TERMINAL FACILITIES: I found the terminal to be cramped and not enough natural lighting. In addition, it got crowded very easily. WIFI: The WiFi at the airport was not good. FOOD & RETAIL: The food was overpriced and not that great. LOUNGE: The Luftansa Business Lounge was nice, and had plenty of seating and food."
5155,8003,"Everything was quick and smooth, except for the fact that they had only a handful of CBP officers available for several international arrivals. If you are a US or Canadian citizen, it is best to download the MPC App. If you don’t, just be ready to stand in the immigration line for a while."
5156,8004,"Smooth process throughout. Nice check in, nice selection of shops, and the air train is my favorite! Remains one of the best airports in the world for me."
5157,8005,Clean and modern airport. Lots of food and shopping selections. What else do I have to say? It’s Dulles Airport!
5158,8006,"Dulles isn’t great, but at least it’s architecturally stunning. The worst thing about this airport are the People Movers after you land."
5159,8007,"TSA agents in Terminal 1 are rude, unhelpful, and snappy. Terminal is tight and not designed for the traffic it gets. Gate areas are crammed."
5160,8008,"DCA is definitely in need of more lounges; the SkyClub is fine but always seems stretched to capacity. The Centurion Lounge coming soon should help that. Security is always a breeze, especially with TSA PreCheck, but the terminal is often crowded, especially in the Delta corner."
5161,8009,Hadn't flown Reagan in over 15 years and was pleasantly surprised at the renovations. No more bussing out to the plane away from the terminal. Love being able to park outside of the city and ride the train directly to the airport.
5162,8010,"I prefer the E-Lounge (Admiral's Lounge) at DCA, which I consider my home airport. The airport itself it just the right size, so it's very quick and easy to walk between terminals. There are three main terminals that AA uses; C, D, and E and each one have an Admiral's Lounge in it, with E being the newest and my favorite. The staff here are always friendly and helpful, from the AA Lounge to GA and FA, as well as ramp crews and airport staff. Parking in the garage outside, I can be through TSA and in the lounge within 10 mins of parking!"
5163,8011,"DCA is extremely convenient for DC residents -- from being able to take the metro, drive, or bike (if you're light on bags), it is maybe the most convenient airport I've ever used as a resident of any city. Do yourself a favor and take the Metro (save yourself the stress of traffic). The only possible downside is the lack of larger planes/further destinations, but with IAD now on metro, DCA can specialize in its small+short flights"
5164,8012,"This review applies to Terminal 2 only (American Airlines). Transited through a rather busy Reagan National. There are great views for the airfield from the D concourse, terminal building and E concourse. The walk from the end of D concourse to the end of E concourse is rather long and with only a 40 minutes connection, I made it to the connecting gate in E concourse with 10 minutes to spare. Overall, a good airport and terminal to transit through."
5165,8013,"Another great airport I landed at Reagan and it was such a nice area to be in, plenty of food options"
5166,8014,T2 is clean and spacious and has a lot of food options. T1 on the other hand is not so neat and tidy and does not have good food options and it is REALLY CRAMPED. it is also out of date
5167,8015,"Washington national is an airport that I will fly into again if I'm flying American or any other carriers out of t2 because t1 sucks, it is cramped and extremely out of date and you also hav to leave security just to get to t2. food options in t1 are ok but food in t2 is good"
5168,8016,Small airports are always nicer than big airports. Closer to the city so travel is shorter; fewer passengers checking in and going through security; and more efficient boarding.
5169,8017,"The Waterloo Airport is my home airport and I greatly admire it as it strives to bea nice and thoughtfull airport. TSA is fast and efficient, but the airport does feature some deffects. There is only a vending machine and a common room for visiting. The airport does include a student pilot building, and may be able to see a mall plane at the airport. This airport has room to grow and develope as a reg."
5170,8018,"The Waterloo Airport is my home airport and I greatly admire it as it strives to bea nice and thoughtfull airport. TSA is fast and efficient, but the airport does feature some deffects. There is only a vending machine and a common room for visiting. The airport does include a student pilot building, and may be able to see a mall plane at the airport.

5171,8019,"The Waterloo Airport is my home airport and I greatly admire it as it strives to bea nice and thoughtfull airport. TSA is fast and efficient, but the airport does feature some deffects. There is only a vending machine and a common room for visiting. The airport does include a student pilot building, and may be able to see a mall plane at the airport. This airport has room to grow and develope as a reg."
5172,8020,"Arived, got to my terminal, and got out of the airport pretty quickly. Note: The baggage claim isn't the best currently. We got there and waited for our bags. There were multiple baggage claim stations that didn't have an airport assigned to them. However, one of them had Chigogo O'hare airport assigned to it (which wasn't our flight). Apparently, the board has been stuck with this status for over 3 days. Our bags were on the belt under the sign that said Chicogo's airport. This caused confusion."
5173,8021,Very nice and clean small airport. Kinda got lost when retiring the rental car but it wasn't terrible. Check-in for JBU was under construction as well as some other parts of the airport. Very nice experience
5174,8022,Wifi was very poor. Worked in only 1 of 3 locations. I'm not sure what else to say. The food options are pretty limited for an airport with so many people flying in and out? It's not a bad airport though.
5175,8023,"The rental car companies are about 5 minutes away, though you may have to wait a while for a shuttle. We rented from Thrifty and had to wait 10-15 minutes for the bus to arrive. The rental car center is somewhat awkward to find."
5176,8025,Nice Airport Beach
5177,8029,"Smaller than AVL, but looked very similar (carpet, chilling crew, etc.). Pickup by Uber was really fast (3 min)."
5178,8030,"Great airport, although quite small with only 8 gates. Only one food option past security, where I got a simple yogurt parfait. No lounges whatsoever."
5179,8032,"This airpot is amazing for arrivals, but for the number of flights they have departing in the morning it just does not have the capacity to handle it properly. Not enough checkin kiosks, not enough TSA lanes, not enough gates, not enough seating areas and a tiny overcrowded concessions store. It is super convenient if you are visiting Westchester. If not for the amazing arrivals experience, I would have given 3 stars based on departure experience."
5180,8033,Baggage claim was very fast and a very quick trip from the gate. Bathrooms were clean and updated. One small complaint is all landside food options were closed at arrival time.
5181,8034,"The best thing about HPN is the easy drive to the airport, especially if someone can drop you off. Check-in is easy, whether you are doing it online or at the kiosk. Security lines are short and fast. The bathrooms are clean, both on the land and airside. There are escalators to the upper levels on landside. Food options on landside are decent with both stands and a full-service bar upstairs however their hours are limited especially if you have an early departure or late arrival. There is a snack shop with good options on airside."
5182,8035,"Getting to the airport/parking: Getting to the airport is quite easy however parking is quite pricey. Check-in: We arrived before the desks opened however, the kiosks were working and we all checked in fine Security: We got there before TSA so had to wait for them to open. However, we were first on line and it took us less than 5 minutes to get through. Facilities: We got to the airport before most of the building was open. The seating in the waiting area and the departure area is a bit worn out but still quite comfortable. Bathrooms throughout the terminal are clean and updated. Wifi: Not offered Food/Retail: For an airport with many early flights, it was surprising they did not open the market on airside until 5 am. The prices however were fairly reasonable and they offered a wide variety. Take note that the restaurant and bar at the airport are not airside. Once you're through security, you'll only have access to the market."
5183,8036,"Parking is expensive, terminal is crowded and small, baggage claim is cramped. But it beats driving all the way to NYC."
5184,8037,HPN was very crowded as always. Very small and only a small food mart post security. TSA was easy and fast. Parking is $30 a day in the garage!
5185,8038,"HPN is a nice airport but is extremely small that does not have many food and beverage options and has a very cramped departure lounge. The location is excellent and the staff is friendly, but it is very cramped especially on a busy day!"
5186,8043,"This is a small airport which I like and has non stop service to Puerto Rico, Which save me a lot of headaches of I would flight out of New York City or Newark airport, hate those airports always crowded and reaaaalllyyy expensive"
5187,8044,"Very easy airport to get around if you're traveling to the Hartford area, or anywhere else in the northeast."
5188,8046,The Escape Lounge in Terminal A was at capacity when I arrived. I had to wait 20 minutes before I was admitted.
5189,8047,To be honest this airport is the perfect medium airport with lots of non stop service and ease of access. On top of that the terminal is very nice and overall it is a great place.
5190,8048,Free wifi is nice and check in is fast. Security is a little slow and food got me sick on my JetBlue flight down to DCA. Bags were quick and bathrooms are nice. getting to the airport was easy by car.
5191,8049,"You have to take GFK for what it is, small. You aren't going to have the luxuries of the major hubs. What it offers is a fast check in, fast security, and a comfortable terminal with wifi."
5192,8050,"Bradley's amenities are ample with a great selection. Several food vendors are McDonalds, Dunkin Donuts, and a take out place. I think there is also a resturaunt past security. All the services are post security. One curious thing about BDL is that the TSA luggage scanners are in the check in area and not underground or behind the counters."
5193,8051,Very nice airport! I loved the rocking chairs in the waiting hall
5194,8052,Free WiFi!
5195,8056,"When departing from the airport, there's amazing local restaurants to say goodbye on the best way possible from this amazing country. Staff is very friendly and fast."
5196,8057,Sometimes there's queue after you pick up your luggage since all suitcases must undergo scanner control once picked.
5197,8058,"So should look like every airport! One of the best! Very clean, helpful and friendly personal, every facilities open at 02 hour in the morning, immigration automated and straightforward. Only quite far from the city."
5198,8059,"Large airport, very calm, new construction, and due to the low quantity of flights, looks this is a low occupancy airport. There is an observation deck area but was not open."
5199,8060,"Small, but amazingly clean and modern. High speed free WiFi, and has food services in case you need snacks to bring on the flight. Almost no wait for Security, was in and out in less than 10 minutes, and the airport never felt crowded. 10/10 would recommend flying to the airport, even though only longhauls are on Air Europa and American. A true Hidden Gem."
5200,8061,"Small but smart airport, passport control, customs and baggage belt are close to each other. Positive aspects: Clean, free wifi,iluminated and friendly staff."
5201,8062,"My home airport! It's small but very modern and nice. Has a clean, sleek look to it, and a nice upper level where you can watch the planes. Getting there is easy because you have public buses as well as taxis and stuff. Check-in is alright, there's lines but if you get there early you can avoid them. Security check usually goes very smoothly, and immigration is usually very fast when you're leaving the country but very slow when you're entering. Food and retail is ok, you got a McDonalds and a McCafe as well as a restaurant inside the terminal, and a few little souvenir shops and a pharmacy, which is okay considering it's a small airport. VIP lounge is really nice and cozy. WiFi kinda sucks!! But overall a nice airport!!!"
5202,8063,"The Montevideo airport is small (due to the size of the country), but very well organized and modern. It was a pleasant surprise."
5203,8064,"Great little Airport! Built in a very impressive way and functioning very well too! Zoo Bad the Architekt decided against using the wonderful design on the airside as well, instead it is built in use for the visitors platform, which does not permit much of a view on the aircraft being serviced."
5204,8066,"Brand new airport. Getting to the airport is easy as it is just a 10 minute ride from the city centre. Check-in was okay but a bit slow. Security check is awful, full body pat-downs and they still force you to remove your shoes which was inconvenient. They also riffle through the bags thoroughly. No money exchange facilities airside. Some parts of the terminal are empty."
5205,8069,"On arrival, immigration and customs were very quick and easy, although baggage delivery was slow. The international departure terminal is rather crowded and messy before you go through security. There was only one very small cafe, which inexplicably closed for over an hour around 6pm. If you need to change left-over Uzbek currency, you have to do it at the small exchange counter in the check-in area, before going through passport control. The airside departures area feels brighter and more modern, with a better choice of F&B and shops/duty-free. There's a small co-working area where laptops and phones can be charged for free."
5206,8070,"Customs were fast, but we waited for baggage for like a half hour. Also very inconvenient move from arrivals to departures."
5207,8071,"Departure: Domestic terminal is really small, three security checks are too much for a small terminal. There's a cafe inside the predeparture area."
5208,8072,"Arrival: Lots of immigration counters open. Exchange offices have good rates, SIM card rates also reasonable. Transport by bus is also possible, just ignore the taxis."
5209,8073,"New restaurant was added to econom lounge zone. Duty free with best price and many products. New check-in system (automatic gate, without person). Not clear the process how to get WiFi access."
5210,8078,"В аэропорт можно пройти только пассажиру, провожающие зайти в здание не могут. Регистрация быстрая. Затем таможня, с выборочным углубленным досмотром (пересчитали все деньги, попросили вывернуть карманы). Паспортный контроль быстро. Досмотр службы безопасности очень долгий, так как работала всего одна точка досмотра. WiFi достаточно быстр. В зале ожидание мест для сидения достаточно, никто не стоял. Есть два или три магазина беспошлинной торговли."
5211,8085,"Aeropuerto muy abandonado, hay que estar atento a las indicaciones del personal, hay momento que no tiene luz ni agua, como todo en Vzla."
5212,8087,"Not too bad. My home airport, sadly pretty empty of traffic. Good AA ADMIRALS lounge. Plenty of queues as always."
5213,8088,"En el check-in primero tuvimos que esperar que la security de SBA, terminara de hablar con unos pasajeros que eran tambien evangélicos como ella y terminaran de orar luego cambiaron de perosnal cuando la gente estuve quejándose. En el chequeo del Ticket con el boarding pass fué mas rápido, en las inslataciones de la Terminal solo habia menos del 10% de las tiendas de comidas abiertas a las 6:00 am el resto cerradas. Durante el vuelo el comportamiento de tripulación es bueno."
5214,8089,"Revolutionary billboards on every corner but during last 10 years did not change much. Airport hotel is still far from finish after a decade of construction. But, security and passport control more friendly, faster and efficient than at Frankfurt the same day"
5215,8090,Transporte hasta caracas BsF 40
5216,8102,"15,8kg mà nhân viên checkin cũng cho, mua có 15kg hehe. K hỏi gì lun. Security đông hơn hồi đi Thái nhiều, chờ cũng kha khá, nhma oke, sân bay đẹp thiệt, bán đủ thứ, L’Occitane Estee Lauder đồ các kiểu"
5217,8103,The taxi or fake grab around the airport is kind of annoying. Better just book the grab on phone. Burger King is very expensive in the airport.
5218,8104,"Nói với checkin agent là cho ngồi hàng bên phải để ngắm hoàng hôn hướng Tây, mà ảnh kêu hết rồi nên thôi ok ngồi bên trái. Không ngắm hoàng hôn"
5219,8105,"Sân bay ok, checkin online nên đi an ninh liền luôn. Vô rồi ngồi chờ xíu là lên máy bay"
5220,8106,"Sân bay lúc checkin vắng tanh vắng tơ. V mà tưởng tới sbay bị trễ nữa cơ, mà mưa tầm tã, sợ có vấn đề lúc bay"
5221,8107,"Bị k cho vô lotus lounge ké với ba vì nhìn lớn quá, ba phải trừ dặm lotusmiles để cho vô"
5222,8108,"Entering the Vietnam Airlines lounge, meeting Ms. Mien Chi's family and Nguyen Ba Thanh's two children traveling in business class"
5223,8110,"Busy airport for the facilities. But efficient and first time ever the check in agent showed me the baggae tag before attaching it to the bag, so I could check the destination was correct."
5224,8111,"Large terminal, rare view on runway as curtain are masking the view but if tou pay for a drink you can seat and enjoy spotting thru dirty windows...."
5225,8113,"Relatively small airport, no shops except drink and sweet. Free Wifi, very quick access thru custom and security... not the best for spotting ( double windows) very few traffic."
5226,8114,"New Airport with many amenities such as a larger, more comfortable waiting room and also a better view and can watch the plane take off and land,"
5227,8115,"Cat Bi They Have A new Airport and the design very like the bird and inside the airport they have a lot of counter check-in, they have so much of store, waiting louge very beautiful and great view to see an airplane take off and landing."
5228,8117,Getting to the airport took forever. Check-in wasn't long but the immigration was. Still had to take off shoes and everything for the short line of security. Wish there were more cafes in the gate.
5229,8118,"The immigration queue is jammed, with no control by the officers. Took me about 1.5 hrs ++ to get out from the immigration hall."
5230,8119,Too long Security check and Immigration. Vietnames and foreigners are undergo an immigration examination and it spends too long.
5231,8120,"Getting to airport is either by taxi or bus. Check-in was a very smooth experience for me with no waiting times and friendly staff. Security and Passport however took more than a solid 45 minutes to clear. Airport itself has not much to do, but felt spacious and peaceful to me without being overcrowded."
5232,8122,Again the longe had a good view over the airport to pass the time for a reasonable stop between flights.
5233,8123,Check in put our bags straight through to London despite having a 2 day stopover in Singapore. Managed to get them delivered to hotel next day
5234,8125,Not far from downtown Hanoi. Not a bad airport at all. Checkin was pretty simple but online check-in was not available for this flight (Thai Smiles). Security was blazingly fast at least at 9am when we were there. Lounges were confusing because I have Star Alliance Gold and I kept on getting referred to other lounges. Very tidy and clean terminal.
5235,8126,"No complaints. Deboarded easily, short line for security. Pickups are easy because there are designated columns which are numbered which you can use to communicate with your pickup."
5236,8129,Well-run airport that was surprisingly calm for such a bustling city. Decent food options and easy to get around.
5237,8130,Long line to check in for Vietnam Airlines. Security not so long but had to take off my boots. Not much in the domestic terminal.
5238,8131,"The second or third time I got through SGN security through the priority route haha. This time I went right in front of the VNA crew, it looked very professional. The mood is also comfortable, but a little sad and wants to stay. First time going to the domestic VNA TSN lounge, nice view haha"
5239,8132,"But somehow that day the wind changed direction and flew around to land at 07R, so we got to see the sunset hehe"
5240,8133,"Airport access is via Grab. Check-in is smooth. There are not many duty free shops. It's cold in the lounge, but they have pho and plenty of canned and pet drinks. When leaving the country, I mistook it for my girlfriend's wife's passport, but it passed through, causing my wife in another row to have a hard time."
5241,8136,"Food and beverage prices are in USD, when paying by credit card it is in VND. Prices are exorbitant by Asian standards. When departing, immigration lines were somewhat long but moved fast. Immigration is before security. Security was swift but there was no separation of trays used for shoes vs personal items."
5242,8139,I feel very good when I am at this airport. Everything is complete and necessary for me. I feel very happy when I arrive at Nha Trang / Cam Rahn.
5243,8140,"Fairly simple airport, mostly used for travel to Nha Trang resort ares. Its about 30km from Nha Trang, takes 40min by taxi. Simple but efficient & clean, not much to do inside - but you hardly expect a lot from that provincial airports"
5244,8142,Where are the free Wi-Fi and water that’s promised on the airport website? The website is also awful and not working. The staff at registration and control are not friendly and not customer-oriented.
5245,8143,New and modern airport. Quick baggage handling. Airport staff checking baggage tags with suitscase to confirm no suitcase is being taken by the wrong owner (great service). Clean and well organized.
5246,8144,"A small airport. It's easy to get to the airport because the road is not busy. The check-in and security check are very quick. However, Phu Quoc Airport is boring. Poor facilities, there is no wifi connection at all. Restaurants aren't good."
5247,8156,This is a review for Terminal 2(International). The new Terminal is a huge improvement over the old(now domestic) Terminal. Getting to the airport is very easy. Check in and immigration I'd always a bit slow. Facilities are perfectly fine. Food and retail services are pretty limited but more are coming. WiFi is slow. I have never been to the lounge
5248,8157,Amazing small airport with good amenities. Gives a real African experience walking on the tarmac to the terminal.
5249,8158,"This airport is very strange. It has a section with duty free zones that normally would have gates, but this isn't the actual departures area. To get there, there is a small passageway leading to a lower level that is kind of hard to find. But once you find the departures sign, there is one cafe and a sequrity check leading to the actual departures area which is a narrow tent that appears to be underdoveloped. However there is air conditioning down there so it's not that bad. Apparently this is the only boarding area and it extends onto the tarmac almost like a gate."
5250,8159,Immigration and customs went smoothly because there was a diplomatic passport line. This made it much easier to enter since I didn't have to purchase a visa
5251,8160,"Nice airport, the staff just a bit slow, the immigration takes ages, and the baggage claim is a bit slow as well. The Food service is a bit bad, and the duty free is also kind of not that good, but all in all, it's really good!"
5252,8161,lovely airport with lovely staff :)
5253,8164,"I remember Harare being like an airport from the 1960s. It was a stopover on a BA flight from LHR-LUS. We had to disembark and re-board. The terminal was a large space with very few passengers, probably only those on my flight to LUS. I don't remember there being any facilities or services"
5254,8165,"I used Hilton Transfers for a private transfer to the airport. It was a reasonable rate, on time, clean vehicle. I would recommend them from this experience."
5255,8166,"Average airport for an African nation. Ground staff are very friendly & going through security as well as customs & immigration is quick & rather pleasant. However, maintenance to the terminal building seems to be lacking as many lights were blown & the aircon wasn't working"
5256,8167,This is a small but new airport. Very clean and well marked out. Customs and Immigration easy and quickly navigated.
5257,8168,"The airport itself is 30 minutes drive from Victoria Falls town. Small, efficient and very clean. A few shops etc in departure and a cozy little Business lounge. Easy journey from walking in to the airport to boarding the aircraft."
5258,8169,"Best and cleanest airport I ever met. It's small, only with a few daily flights, but veri clean. There are some restaurant and shops, and its enough. The securyti check and immigration etc. is very fast. It' a bit far from Victoria Falls, but not horrible. The toilets are clean, You don't have to touch anything incluiding the door, its also automatic. You can simply walk from the plane to the terminal and back, no any bus."
