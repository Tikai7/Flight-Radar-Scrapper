7006,"TSA lines early in the morning are painfully long. Only 2 of the 4 scanners are open despite people queueing up for 30 minutes. Flights into and out of Albany are often cancelled. Other than Southwest, airlines mostly operate small RJ aircraft that force cancellations more often."
7007,"TSA early in the morning has possibly the worst line backed up out of any US airport. It is there every day and the TSA seems to think they are below average. It often takes over 1 hour to get to security. Once there, they have 2 of 5 scanners working. These are not smart people."
7018,-
7034,The non TSA pre check line was +1hour long. Passengers were going to the front of the line to avoid missing their flight. Get there 2 hours early if you need to return a car and/or check luggage.
7040,What a shit show starting with Delta lost in managing queues for checkin counters and baggage drops. Most uncomfortable experience so far this year.
7041,"Very poorly signed, with no elevated signs indicating the locations of the shuttle or Uber pick-up locations (signage only found in the form of stickers on the floor by the escalators...very easy to miss). Overall, the airport seemed crowded and not very ergonomic in design."
7045,"Loved all the shopping and dining options, and how modern and clean ATL looked, but literally had the worst customs/TSA experience ever here"
7073,"under construction, but all ok should be good when its done"
7086,birmingham
7095,"There are almost no food / drink options before going through security at this airport. I had to wait for a delayed flight for about 5 hours, and couldn't get through security for a few hours because I also had a bag to check in, so I was stuck out there"
7102,"We had a somewhat miserable time at BOS as we spent over 10 hours there due to delays. While this isn't indicative of everyone's experience, our was not good."
7119,"What an awful airport. It's small, the staff fulfill the worst of American stereotypes, sleeping there is a thoroughly unpleasant experience with hardly any amenities, and the constant blaring of the TVs fills your unconscious with right-wing propaganda."
7120,Much bigger airport than I expected
7128,Came here instead of LAX
7144,Airport is under heavy constructions. Very few restaurants and shops only. Two piers despite the fact CHS is very small. Still cosy what I apreciate about airports in the southeast
7146,"Not a bad little airport, but being stuck there for 5 hours waiting for a replacement aircraft was torture. Free wifi and pleasant staff, though."
7155,Everywhere you look there is a line. Bathroom? yep. Baggage claim? yep. I got stuck in a line trying to simply exit the terminal. Like the door to exit wasn't enough for the amount of foot traffic. Hate this place with a passion.
7156,I have flown arrived and departed from 16 different airports. This one is the worst. Airport is permanently under construction (not uncommon for a large airport). TSA is straight up rude at CLT. Wifi is very slow. Way overcrowded.
7167,"THE MOST EXPENSIVE AIRPORT I HAVE EVER TRAVELED THROUGH! BRING PLENTY OF $$$$$ IF YOU PLAN OF GETTING ANY FOOD, EVEN FAST FOOD! TERRIBLE RIP OFF!"
7168,"Ground agent unfriendly, counted my poster tube the 3rd carry-on. I had to de-assemble the tupe and put them into my bag to make the carry-on 2."
7175,"Execrable assistance service for PRMs. They help you out of the plane, take you in a wheelchair to a place in Terminal B and tell you, sorry we don't know how to go down the escalator, you have to go to your gate yourself. in terminal C located several hundred meters away."
7180,Staff at the airport are rude. There are no clear signs to help travellers find their way inside the terminal and the staff are not friendly. I had a stressful experience at this airport.
7187,"Convoluted exit after baggage collection as you have to go through security again to exit. After customs and baggage collection you enter a security area where your bag is put on a conveyer belt that sends your bag to the carousel upstairs, but then you go through security, including liquids check, before exiting to the carousels. This is because you join departing passengers in the airport, hence the security checks. Airport not really set up for international arrivals."
7188,"CVG is normally a very efficient airport. Today, I was greeted by the rudest, most unprofessional Delta ticket agent who was also abusing every piece of luggage I saw her touch. TSA pre was closed, but the pre line was not blocked off, so you just ended up walking to an unmanned station with no signage. TSA did provide a card so we didn’t have to remove shoes, belt, etc. It was still awkward being behind “non regular” fliers that need 5 totes and 10 min to put everything on the belt for security clearance."
7202,"I get to my flight I'm flying allegiant so I get to the airport early so that I can check in, the nice person behind the counter said that my TSA pre-check isn't valid for this trip and that I will have to go through the normal line, this line was so long that by the time I was getting my shoes on they were calling me to my flight because they were about to leave without me. I got to the airport an hour before I'm supposed to board the flight. The airport did look nicer but it looks like an airport from the 80s that just has a nice paint job."
7209,"Its a REALLY OLD and SMALL airport, and i really didn't enjoy the stay. Even though i only had to stay there for 50 min, the services were pretty bad..."
7225,"As an unaccompanied minor, my parents credit card information got stolen in the literal UM holding room. (These ratings are from the UM Program)"
7231,"Bus shuttle between terminals outside is pretty m'eh, old busses that have no shocks so the luggage gets unforgivingly bounced around, and it takes a long, long time. The bags came out 40 minutes after the plane landed, even though the claim was relatively close to the gate, and it's an all American Airlines terminal so they should have it down pretty efficiently."
7242,No problems
7248,My least favorite airport. Everything is far away and the food options either fall short or have an hour-long line.
7252,A absolute mess. It was horrible to get throught the airport especially with a dog and luggage. The trains were late and annoying.
7262,"Leaving from ""McNamara terminal"" (Delta flight). Questionable check-in procedure, you must do the check-in by yourself at the machines (no alternative) but after you have a long queue to drop the luggage (and a badly controlled queue as well...). What is the gain of the self-check-in then? New safety procedure, totally different from standard... you keep your jacket on, but metallic objects and phones must go in the bags... might be more efficent on long term, now is just confusing. Layout of terminal is questionable too, very very long straight corridor... very long walks."
7264,No free WiFi
7270,THERE WAS DOG POOP SPREAD ALL OVER THE AUTO WALK WAY AND BY THE TRASH CANS. WAS NOT CLEANED UP FOR THE HOUR I WALKED BY TWICE.
7300,Really small airport. Only 5 gates.
7307,"Immigration here is the most complicated I've seen in the world. It seems every step in the process is designed to be more complicated for you. I don't understand why you go thru baggage claim first, then have to wind you way thru the queue with all your heavy luggage. Absolutely trash."
7312,"I waited in a mile-long line at bag drop for two hours, which made me almost miss my flight. There was only one employee while the others were having conversations. Security wasn’t helpful that day."
7354,"Harrisburg is the bare minimum airport possible in the United States. One runway, one terminal. A handful of food options, all of them overpriced and of poor quality. Never could figure out if the terminal even had a Wi-Fi system. This is the sort of airport that you use only when you have no other options. Having said that I'd rather fly here than drive to PHL."
7361,"So In my opinion, the Honolulu airport is one of the most confusing airports I’ve been to, we did not find out that you had to go through agriculture to get to the mainland airlines, we made it with two minutes to spare, are flight was delayed by 3 hours because of the construction of the Honolulu Airport which made us have to run through the airport."
7369,"Security line was near an hour long and the staff were kinda rude. Also, the USDA staff threw everyone’s luggage around while “checking for fruits.” The USDA’s X-ray machine also malfunctioned, causing bags to push each other off the conveyer belt and onto the floor"
7375,"Pretty run down and awful looking. Not sure about public transport but the traffic did seem a bit chaotic. United Lounge was okay, it had a good view, however. The immigration officer was really cool, he even made small talk with us and told us about how he used to live in North Carolina"
7376,Poorly laid out and signed. TSA was quick and fairly painless but every other aspect lacked - particularly the lack of options for fresh food in the terminal. Only one cafe where the menu is in Spanish isn’t good enough for an international terminal.
7421,"Slowest bag claim in the world. Doesn’t matter the time of day or airline, minimum 20 minute wait."
7425,"This is a very nice , small airport . One of the better Florida airports ."
7430,"What an absolutely awful airport. Hot, cramped, not enough seating and the ‘lounge’ is a joke."
7431,"What an absolutely awful airport. Hot, cramped, not enough seating and the ‘lounge’ is a joke."
7446,"Smallest worst airport, avoid until the new terminal is complete, in probably last 2023 or early 2024."
7447,"Narrow terminal/concourse, limited food/store options. The bathrooms were not clean. Difficult to get a Lyft/Uber/Taxi from the airport."
7448,"Worst airport in the US. Not enough seats in terminal. 30 mins to wait on bag claim, another 30 mins for Economy Lot shuttle bus."
7450,"MCI when it was built, totally fit the need for the area. Now that times have changed, especially with security, the airport is far from ideal. Only 4-5 per gates per post security area. Very few food options and in this instance, only one working Mens toilet for 100 or so people. Can’t wait for the renovations to be complete to see it become functional again."
7462,"This is a VERY Mediocre airport. I love Hawaii but don't like KOA. The reason being is that it's extremely hot, all the vending machines and the water fountains are out of order. There's one restaurant in the entire airport. The WiFi was fine for downloading the UA app but it was finicky. Hope this place gets an upgrade."
7464,"Usually small airports are quick and efficient. Not this one, took forever to move the bags about 50 yards."
7465,"Not like any airport that I've been to. More like a bus terminal. No jetway to airplane. Must take ramps down to tarmac, thankfully it wasn't raining, but hard on my knees. Signage once in airport is 8 1/2 x 11 paper taped to posts. Best to just follow other passengers to baggage claim. Really just a jumble of open air buildings with no amenities. Really poor facility."
7470,"2 hours in line for TSA!!! What a joke, loads of people missing there flights because TSA was to lazy to work more than 1 machine, shame on this excuse for an airstrip"
7483,It was pretty nice. But when my kids walked out they saw the casino and thought it was an arcade for old people!????????????
7491,"Took forever to get through the covid screening area. No air conditioning at the airport, it's kind of open. Crappy cell phone signal and no Ubers readily available."
7494,ontime arrival
7498,Stopover without getting out
7513,"LAX is an embarrassment to the second largest city in the US. Traffic is slightly better since the airport inaugurated ""LAXit,"" a lot especially for rideshares. The problem is, unlike other airports, you can't catch your ride right outside the terminal, but, jetlagged and exhausted, you have to board a crowded shuttle to an offsite lot and wait again there. They're finishing an interterminal tram, but LAX still feels primitive and clunky compared to DAL, MIA or other better planned airports."
7527,Small Midwestern airport whose FBO isn't really equipped to handle a charter EMB-145XL. Baggage handling difficult. The only de-icing truck they could find on departure was so broken down that it almost had to be pushed into place by hand.
7537,"The absolute worst airport I have ever been to. Bare bones facilities, terrible food and drink services with the exception of Dunkin' Donuts, rude security staff, the airport is 2.5 hours away from Orlando and shouldn't even be considered an Orlando airport."
7543,Everything shuts down after 8:30 pm! Landside doesn’t have any restaurants or places to eat properly. International airport unworthy
7551,Busiest airport in the US and the western hemisphere for cargo flights.
7554,MIA is not a good airport to transit. I was already stressed as there was little time between my flights. What I didn't need was the further stress created by the time it takes to transit. I also find US airports overpriced. There is the feeling that they know that passengers have no other options and up the price of everything.
7555,Customs was a nightmare. More than 2 hours waiting. Dozens of passengers missed their connecting flights.
7575,"This airport is terrible. Dirty in some places and a pain to navigate. The pick-up area by baggage claim is abysmal and the security presence is non-existent, cars are sitting there idle for way too long."
7601,smooth
7610,"TSA gets crazy here. The waiting line is across the airport entrance until the entrance door. They managed to increase the waiting time in the line from 30 Minutes two weeks ago to 50 Minutes. I was warned as friends had to queue up for an hour. If you want to fly from BNA, calculate an hour for TSA. No United Lounge available. The waiting seats look nice, made of stainless steel. Prevent you to sit too long..."
7617,"The new terminal is 20 mins away from rental car facility by shuttle. The free shuttles run only intermittently and are packed. New terminal looks nice, but the difficulty getting to the airport w/o dedicated off-ramp from highway is quizzical."
7618,"Avoid at all costs. Getting to the airport is very slow, buses are rare and taxis expensive. No food between 8pm and 5am. Internet is spotty, disconnects randomly and is slow. Aircondition is set to max, bring warm clothes if staying for more than an hour. Security doesn't seem to be able to handle big passenger amounts. Shops and restaurants are very limited. Avoid this airport unless you really want to go to New Orleans."
7620,Seriously the most poorly maintained terminal in the US. Many in third world countries are nicer than this. Food and dirt and insects everywhere. I felt greasy and dirty just existing here.
7621,"This is my home airport, and it is pretty awful considering the traffic volume. This is a black eye for New Orleans. Fortunately, there is a brand new, full size 35 gate terminal facility being built. It opens February 2019. Until then, bring your own food if Smoothie King can't hold you over for your flight. I will say that the Delta terminal D is actually very nice and modern. That is the only portion of the old 4 terminal airport that will remain after demolishing the old terminals."
7624,"One of worst airports I’ve been. I departed from Terminal 1 and there was only one officer to check passaports,and the staff were very rude, constantly rushing passengers through security checks."
7625,Abysmal security facilities even at 06:00 - not enough staff to open Priority Lane and inept handling of items once scanned. Not rushing back to JFK any time soon ;-( BA Greenwich Lounge was very well appointed - a bright experience after the dire Security facility.
7632,"Due to constructions going on inside the airport, there is a discrepancy between what is actually running versus what the signs and announcements say how things are running. Getting from terminal 8 to terminal 1 was a nightmare because I got several mixed signals from airport employees and announcements. Almost missed my connection!"
7633,"Awful. Rude and unhelpful immigration staff. Awful queue organisation. Poor number of booths open for the volume of passengers, waited well over 90 minutes without any information. Poor facilities once through immigration. All bags removed from carousel it took so long."
7639,"Had the most expensive 'few food items' from one of the food outlets before going to the gate. There were four of us, two of us had a sandwich, two of us had a pasta-in-a-plastic-box; we had a bottle of drink each and one bag of sweets and it came to £91! I'm all for making a profit but that's taking the p***! Don't buy food at the airport; eat before you go or take a load of money with you."
7652,"Awful airport. Nothing open, small and tired decor and facilities. Bad food outlets, no lounge and no information."
7663,Little of no option to buy food apart from Starbucks.
7668,"Some parts of the terminal are better than others. Very cold inside (AC turned up). Decent selection of news stores, but bad selection of restaurants."
7672,"Hated this airport. The staff was rude, unhelpful, offered me a wheelchair because I was Deaf! The staff was highly uncoordinated, one didn't even know they offered flights via Norwegian Air! Worst airport ever. No food before security either."
7683,Needs a remodel. Dirty. Employees don’t seem to care that work at the small restaurants. Terminal A is horrible
7688,"Very small airport, which makes it nice for getting through security quick and easy, not much on the other side though, so pack your snacks."
7691,"International Arrival is in another building. There are no facilities when you get out. Make sure your pickup knows where the international arrivals area is located. Outbound - there isn't a lot of selection in the terminal. It's pretty barren, make sure you eat something or grab food before you get to the terminal. It's all a bit sad."
7692,Arriving into the customs building there are two flights at the same time most nights (Aeromexico and Volaris). Why they don't make them separate by an hour beats me! It was very slow although they did their best. Inefficient airport facility though as the main terminals are underutilized.
7695,"Pretty far from everything, but a decent alternative to fly into LA/OC area."
7700,F A B
7713,Hated this airport! I hate the 45 minute check in and security lines. I can see why alligent made a hub here because they both charge you for the air you breath. Anything you buy here is expensive and seating is non existent in this crowded airport. I was going to have to drive 2 hours over to Melbourne that day anyway. I much prefer MLB or MCO.
7714,Signage to the airport is very confusing. Had to loop around to figure out where long term parking actually was. Very long walk from parking to the terminal. Inside the airport is very confusing. Maze of poorly marked long corridors. Only 2 places were open to eat at 11 am. I'd prefer to use DAB or MCO.
7717,"(Terminal A) The terminal was very small and dark. Poor lighting for an early morning departure. Check in was fine, and security went quick however we were at the front of the line and there are only 2 metal detectors. Bad wifi connection and not clearly labeled. Very few open stores and a minimalist food court. There was one window to look out of and Terminal B was poorly sign posted. (Terminal B) After a gate change we ended up in Terminal B. It was a lot brighter and more food and retail options. If you cant find anything in A, go to B. It is just down a corridor past the gate area."
7719,"Pretty poor airport. Duty free looks good. Food is virtually non existant. There is an eatery but the food doesn't look fresh. Big area to sit in with one bar at the far end, a bit pricy though. There is an outside smoking area which overlooks the runway and the scrap yard area for planes. Other than allegiant there are very few airlines using Sanford. Monarch have ceased all long haul and Thomas Cook now use Orlando, which I feel is a far better airport"
7723,One food line was 45min for to go and the other was 25min. Food is high priced and long lines. Need more options. Clear was all the way across the terminal and going through precheck was faster without it.
7726,"The best little airport. The outside walk between Check-In / Baggage area and the two terminals is great. Parking Drop-off and car rentals are just a few steps or a short walk away. Only problems sometimes, a queue at security and no lounges."
7736,"Domestic air travel is terrible. I paid for Business Class and received absolutely nothing for the additional expense. I was assigned standard seating in the 12th row over the exit window, and received exactly the same accommodations that everyone else was offered on board."
7739,"Lot of construction (hopefully after that, this airport will look slightly better). Doesn't have CLEAR. Lounges not open"
7742,"Trenton Mercer is a tiny airport, the terminal is basically one big room. The plus side is that security and check in are really fast, but at the gate it was super crowded. Took us 10 minutes for us to find a seat."
7743,"Baggage check-in chaos. People missing flights because of waiting times. NO public transportation to airport, long, long walk from bus or septa especially with even minimalist luggage. TTN is way beyond start-up problems, need to get their act together."
7764,"Waited in line for 40 minutes in the TSA Pre-check line because they were only using 1 lane in the ""alternate screening area""... Was directed there by a TSA officer, who said the lines were significantly shorter (which was blatantly untrue)"
7774,"Check-In was a breeze and the agents were friendly. Gate had trash on the seats and floor. Gate agents boarded wayyyy too slow. Terminal facilities were mostly closed. One small gift shop had a line of 8 people because there was just one employee, and he was very slow. He admitted that he was just waking up. With 4 Gate agent, only two were actully working."
7780,Good gateway to Maine .
7811,Back to the School for Officer Training.
7812,Fast baggage delivery and free wifi.
7835,"This airport is about as bad as LHR. TONS of walking just to get to your gate if you aren't flying Delta. If you fly American, do NOT arrive any time earlier than 4 hours. you'll only be wasting your time, as they won't print out your checked baggage tags. I was lucky this time. You MIGHT be able to check earlier, but it's a big toss of the coin."
7837,Horrible setup. No train between concourses. Long walk. One flight involved a long walk down scaffolding and then a bus to the plane.
7838,"This airport is extremely crowded, it is still under construction, meaning you have to walk via an underground tunnel between concourse A and concourse B which will take you 15 to 20 minutes, depending how many pax you have to dodge. There is only ONE tunnel that connects the two concourses. The gate areas are over crowded, the gate lice over flow into the walk ways."

7857,"Security is pretty rough with only 2 check lanes, sometimes only one. Pre-check doesn’t really exist, it’s integrated with the normal lines. They have you wait like 20 passengers per and then take pre check for a minute or two. Construction outside the airport is kind of bad too, getting backed up often."
7861,Small and crowded airport. To change planes I had to leave secure area and then go through security again since gates are not connected by secure passageways. WiFi dropped several times as I moved from one set of gates to another.
7865,Very discouraging to have no food or beverage options at the AS AA ticket counter area. SBUX has been closed for a few years.
7870,"All escalators at rental carsstation of skytrain in maintance at same time? Why not, who would be on place like that with big luggage.. Baggage drop off also have original system. You have to print the bagagae tracking sticker yourself on kiosk. Then wait about 3m from the counter until employee takes it from you."
7885,The airport is tiny. The custom is extremely inefficient. It took an hour to process 20 people. The most unfriendly custom I have ever seen.
7896,I love smaller airports like SNA. They are so much easier to get in and out than monstrosities such as LAX.
7898,"New gates almost done,"
7913,"While I realize the airport is under construction and has been for some time, signs directing travelers to the places they need to be (checkin counters, TSA Checkpoints, etc) are not exactly informative. Flying from the North Terminal (Southwest), the temporary walls prohibit visibility to the airline checkin counters and cause excessive searching along the narrow passageway. Also, the way lines are set up for CLEAR and TSA Pre Check are at best, confusion and create confusion with travelers using those access points. I entered using the CLEAR line that does not go to TSA Pre Check, as the confusion created an exceptionally long line for the CLEAR access to TSA Pre Check. Hopefully, this airport will be greatly improved when the construction is completed."
7916,"Customs was extremely slow even with MPC. I haven’t been in customs that slow in literal years. After customs, there was a single TSA line open for connecting to domestic flights that took about 30 minutes to get through even with only a few people in front of me. It turns out, I could’ve just followed the signs to exit then gone in through regular security (and used my PreCheck) but the workers didn’t say anything about that until we were 4th in line. On top of all that, the TSA workers were massive power tripping douchebags. Never had a worse TSA experience."
7918,"The terminal looks very 80s in some parts the Delta staff were slow, the machines were broken and the baggage claim screens only show Alaska Airlines"
7919,Extremely unfriendly homeland security staff who did not allow me to enter and did not give me any reason for the revocation of my visa.
7937,"Bad airport, confusing to get to. Terminal is outdated and likely from the 70s. Some of the rudest TSA agents I've dealt with even with Pre-check. terminal has little shopping and food, and doesn't have a Skyclub. Overall disappointing airport."
7948,"Easy to get to. Issue is lounges and the lack of them. Amex and piroty pass is useless. The airport is old and has lots of leaking pipes. Besides that it's clean and usable. It reminds me of old, lga. If you have access to admirals club or are military personal. Lounges aren't a issue."
7951,"The rental car facilities are a nightmare - on the other side of the highway, rocky shuttle ride to/from the terminal, and confusing signage of how to get back to return the car. The terminal itself doesn't have much to offer food-wise (at least not the A gate (UA/DL), other than sit-down restaurants. I recommend Vino Volo as it seems to have a smaller crowd but the food is actually quite tasty (if on the expensive side). No lounge available except for an independent one in the other (Southwest Airlines) terminal. This airport was better way back in the day when it was a TWA hub, to be honest. Just not very impressive for a city of St. Louis' caliber."
7965,"Really small airport with nothing exciting, only plus is that TSA times are really quick. No reason to be called an international airport."
7967,"Honestly, KTLH is just about the worst airport, ever. The city of Tallahassee itself isn't much to write home about, but the outdated airport with an ""international"" designation makes it worse. It's tiny, it looks like it came straight out of the 1970s, and the interior has been ""renovating"" for quite some time now. The flights are stupid expensive, your only options are Silver, Delta Connect, and American Eagle, and if you don't want to go to Atlanta, you'd better like tiny aircraft. If you can, avoid TLH at all costs."
7969,The airport and its access points are impeccable. UNITED onboarding service: OK Security check: it looks like a western where cows are herded. Elderly people or on the verge of abuse No UNITED Lounge for holders of a Business ticket pompously called First.
7977,"Traffic was terrible en route to the airport, check in took 45 minutes due to computer issues. Security was rude and didn't seem to care, they didn't ask to empty bags at all, they weren't even watching the bags on the machines. Most of the restaurants were ""closed"" and the boarding announcments never happened so we almost missed our flight."
7990,Last on Plane
7991,"Medium sized regional airport with UA, AA, DL, and WN hub service on a mix of Regional and Mainline metal. Also Allegiant and Frontier service. Older terminal that could use some upgrades. Clean and well kept, however. Rental car return was odd, as it's unclear where to go to return the car to the right company. You then walk into the airport on the departures level, but have to go downstairs to the airline checkin counters, which are also a little hard to find. Back upstairs for security, which is fairly standard; one line for Precheck and most of the space for non-Precheck. Plain vanilla past security with a few shops and restaurants; not sure if there is a lounge but not one that I could use. Gate areas have clean seats and are well lit; boarding is quick and easy enough."
8000,"The worst immigration experience ever. 2 hours queuing, hundreds of people, no place to sit, not able to go to the toilets without losing one’s place in the queue, no water. A total lack of information and respect from US CBP vis-a-vis both visitors and US residents! Most countries do a much better job (just go North of the border to Canada)…"
8024,nice
8026,"Small, simple airport. Easy in, easy out. Not much to do inside though, if you are stuck"
8031,Airport is too small for the amount of flights it is serving. Waiting area is communal for all gates. It was standing room only for six hours of delays. All food sandwiches ran out at the one available food place on the secure side.
8045,"There are barely any food options when headed to gates 1-12. Also, Dunkin donuts always has a super long line. It's best to eat before arrival to the airport, it saves you money, and alleviates the lack of options."
