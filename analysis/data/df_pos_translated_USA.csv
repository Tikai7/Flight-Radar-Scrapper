7001,Small but pretty and clean airport! Looks like a museum and is well-structured. Very friendly staff!
7002,"I like ALB because it's close and convenient. Lines are usually quick which I appreciate. Only downside is that the restaurants tend to close a bit early, so if you have a late flight, you may not be able dine in the terminal. The restaurants themselves are nice however."
7003,"The airport was beautiful, there was no lounges but it made up for it with the nice seats by the gate and the restaurants they had."
7004,"Great small airport, parking, checking in, security, and boarding was all straight forward with no problems."
7005,"Two letters EZ. At 6 in the morning the airport is bustling with travelers bound for cities throughout the Northeast, no line or traffic to airport, nice new road, easy signage, fast and efficient security, easy boarding. Truely solid regional airport"
7008,Good value
7009,"The airport is definitely more of a cozy home type of airport and is really nice because of that! What makes it three stars though? Security is horribly rude for absolutely no reason. The second to last time I visited the airport, two guys were bullying a passenger for not completely understanding the process (he's not a frequent traveler). Overall, it's a beautiful airport with extraordinarily rude security with the lack of a reason, and a good one at that. Oh yeah, let's not forget the single guy that owns most every food or drink business in the airport, and still doesn't ""allow"" competition."
7010,The airport itself is very easy to navigate and well maintained. The rental car arrangement is a giant pain.
7011,"Getting to the airport was easy enough even though it is a bit outside of the city. Check-in was easy even though one of the people in our group had trouble with the kiosks. The security check was incredibly fast. Terminal facilities were fine and clean. The seating areas are plentiful and very comfortable. Wifi was a bit slow but adequate, a little difficult to log in. Food options were good but way too expensive even for airport prices. Retail was the standard but had some nice local options."
7012,"Easy to navigate, and plenty of places to sit down or rearrange your items. Getting to the airport is fine but getting to the rental car pickup involves taking a shuttle and it's a bit of an inconvenience. Wifi is adequate but slow and a little difficult to log in to."
7013,"Hard to not like the ABQ Sunport! I find flying to or from here is easy and convenient. All staff I encounter is extremely friendly and accommodation. Not to mention, I just love the southwestern/New Mexican style architecture of the terminal building."
7014,"Have to say for a small airport it's definitely one of the nicer ones es for its age. Getting through security is easy, parking is plentiful and the restrooms are realy clean! There is a good microbrewery (once you get through security) once you get to the point to the point that you have to select which terminal you are boarding."
7015,"Awesome facility with the southwestern feel and architecture. I really enjoyed the public observation deck, great views of the mountains, they just need my aircraft movements."
7016,"Great airport... Arrived late and Delta misplaced luggage. Handled quickly by Delta rep and suitcase arrived at hotel a few hours later. Free wifi, no problem at all getting a taxi at 9 PM. Shops and restaurants seemed to be closed. Departure--- about $20 for a taxi from near Old Town, check-in and security fast. Plenty of outlets to charge electronic devices. A few restaurants and shops... $3.19 for a bottle of Coke at the news stand seems criminal though."
7017,"One of my favorite airports. Laid back and easy to navigate. Now that the Wright amendment is gone, I will be here less, but did enjoy the quick layovers on WN with a Kiva juice ready to go to California or back to DAL."
7024,"It's your average mid market airport nothing special, but it has a McDonalds. It has good views though"
7025,Good airport to fly in and fly out of. Even has a place to just watch the planes from a climate controlled space.
7026,"The Anchorage Airport is beautiful. It has lots of daylight and beautiful views of the mountains. It has plenty of cargo activity, so there are some large, fascinating airplanes passing through the airport. My one complaint is the WiFi and phone service in the building. While it is easy to join the WiFi network, it can be extremely sluggish at times. Hotspotting off a phone doesn't always work very well either since there are some weak service areas in the airport."
7027,"ANC is a cool little airport that I’d love to explore more in the future. Lots of art installations that range from gorgeous to quirky, great tarmac views, solid food options and even a pop-up Delta Sky Club! Loved the window decals all over giving interesting facts about the airport — had no idea it was 4th busiest for cargo in the US!"
7028,"Ted Stevens is truly an airport like no other. Forget the hassle, the lines, and the crowds. PANC has none of that. Love this airport."
7029,"We enjoyed the experience at the airport. The WiFi is free and it's really needed, as in Alaska only GCI showed on my phone and had no data coverage. All the staff was friendly and the experience was smooth. One minus is that the exit ramp from the car rentals is really poorly designed, a slightly longer car barely fits through there."
7030,"Surprisingly good airport. Realize that this used to be the gateway to Asia in the days before modern jetliners with 10,000 miles of range but was pleasantly surprised to find a modern facility."
7031,Anchorage was amazing! beautiful mountains and snow in June! But it was quite odd to be in totally different side of the world after such a long trip. And it was pretty weird cuz everybody was speaking in english and I didnt knew anyone at all there!
7033,Very aesthetically pleasing airport. Really pretty interior and easy to navigate. In terms of food/retail there isn't any besides a plethora of vending machines at least airside. Staff was very friendly. Would absolutely fly here again! Also had good Wi-Fi
7035,"First time ever flying into this airport. Loved the opportunity to see my home from the plane on our way in. It's a very small regional airport, but it is convenient. The bar is very nice, and worth checking out if you are coming through when it is open."
7038,"ATL is obviously a DL hub, so other airlines often end up with gates that are, sub-par. AS is no exception, being allocated gate D3 at the end of DLs regional concourse alongside Frontier and Spirit. The gate area is extremely small and congested. Definitely no need to show up early and wait - you'll thank yourself later. Check-in was just chaos for seemingly no reason - AS and their new bag check/tag machines are not fast and they cause lots of confusion and the line was very long."
7039,"Massive airport that you should allow at least 45 minutes to connect through, because Delta runs the whole show and while there's some predictability about which gate you'll get into/leave from, things can change. Some great Delta lounges, some mediocre ones."
7042,"Atlanta's terminals are starting to show their age--they feel worn down and cramped. However, the TSA pre-check line was well-organized and efficient, and the Delta Lounge in the A gates was very spacious and well-stocked."
7043,"Loved all the shopping and dining options, and how modern and clean ATL looked, but literally had the worst customs/TSA experience ever here"
7044,"Loved all the shopping and dining options, and how modern and clean ATL looked, but literally had the worst customs/TSA experience ever here"
7046,"Loved all the shopping and dining options, and how modern and clean ATL looked, but literally had the worst customs/TSA experience ever here"
7047,"The best airport if you are in transfer, max 10 minutes to get from any terminal to any other, fantastic :-))))"
7053,Small airport but check in and going through security is a breeze. Usually it's not very crowded and plenty of seats are available.

7056,Small airport but check in and going through security is a breeze. Usually it's not very crowded and plenty of seats are available.
7057,Super small and brand new. Security lines are either small or empty.
7059,The security line is really fast and there are decent food options not too far from wherever you may be in the airport. Good public transit access.
7060,"its crusty, dirty, and overall represents baltimore very well. Baggage claim SUCKS, I had to wait 1 hour+ for my bag Nice mcdonalds tho"
7061,I love this airport because of the big windows that let you look to everything that is happening outside. Take your time to wander around and explore. There are also things to see even though you are not flying.
7062,"Getting Through Airport: Nice, and easy, but crowded due to midday rush Check-In: No check-in! Connecting flight :) Security: No security, connecting flight :) Terminals: Decorated, nice and spacious, got rid of the rocking chairs by the windows though :( But it is easy to navigate :) WiFi: WiFi was smooth but lagged in between times Food and Retail: Plenty of choices with quick and easy service Lounge: No lounges :( But seating area is nice :)"
7063,"Getting Around Airport: Easy with the walkways and signs, it is a cool airport to walk through and has LONG Terminals Terminals: They were nice and clean, had art on the wall and had shops around every corner, as well as Southwest planes :) WiFi: WiFi was quick and smooth but froze in between times Food/Retail: Food was great, had lots of options Lounge: No lounge that I could find :( Immigration/Customs: Stayed in America. No Customs :) Baggage Claim: connecting flight. No baggage claim :) Overall a nice time"
7064,"Immigration was ok but the queue went slow, all 15-20 foreigners had to go through one officer; they've periodically halt the queue to let the US citizens pass, despite there were several other queues solely for them"
7065,"A bit difficult to get to from DC, but other than that a great experience. My usual way from DC is Metrorail -> MARC Penn line to BWI station -> Shuttle bus to BWI. I think the food and retail services here could be a bit better."
7066,"BWI to me is ""an"" airport. I wouldn't recommend a connection here longer than 3 hours as you will be bored out of your mind wandering back and forth through the endless halls of southwest gates with the only distinguishing feature telling you if you are in Concourse A or B being if you passed the Coffee Shop or Jamba Juice. With that being said, there are some nice views and comfortable areas to chill out while waiting for your flight. There are more than enough food options, including multiple full sitdown restaurants, which I did not try, but they did smell very good. All in all, BWI is an airport I try to spend a minimal amount of time in, but if i am stuck here, its not the worst thing in the world."
7067,"Very nice terminal and services, sadly several food venders were closed or were very slow. We had to wait over half an hour on the ground for our gate to open up, and what was supposed to be a 1-hour layover turned into a 10-minute mad dash to catch my connection. Luckily it was delayed too. Delays were due to slow ground handling (according to the WN crew)"
7068,"It always feels to me like Southwest, more so than any other major US carrier, packs as many people as can uncomfortably fit into its hub airports/terminals."
7070,"Again, TSA is not customer friendly. They actually treat us as if we are an inconvenience. This attitude starts at the top, so maybe they need new leadership in the sector. Baggage claim equipment is good. Alaska personnel are slow."
7071,"BLI is a small airport and easy to travel out of whether you are a US Citizen or from Canada. I, like most people, don't like being treated like dumb cattle by the Thousands Standing Around people. They need to grow a smile. You can still have good security and not be a unpleasant."
7072,"Great little airport with cheap onsite parking. Security is a breeze, terrific restaurant and bar, free wi-fi. While crowded at times, it's still easy enough to get through the masses in record time. Construction is complete, and it's become my favorite airport to travel in and out of."
7074,Small airport. They were doing expansion when I was there.
7075,"Very nice staff, but very old fashioned facilities"
7076,"Incredible airport. Very well set up, nicely organized, open layout with great ramp views. Absolutely amazing."
7077,"Pretty good little regional airport. 17 gates with hub service on regional jets by UA, AA, and DL. Also A320 service on Allegiant to a couple of holiday destinations. The usual rental car counters (most lacking express service like National Emerald Aisle), two bag claim carousels with reasonably speedy service, a few restaurants and the obligatory public art and advertisements for local attractions. Pretty much what you'd expect from a regional airport."
7078,Awesome airport. Love spotting and traveling here. Sports charters sometimes and great facilities. 5 out of 5
7079,"This is a fairly new airport, very clean. Still has that ""new airport"" smell. Parking options need work but they're getting better (parking deck under construction). Food options limited but decent. Wifi works well enough to be useful. Clean."
7080,"NICE AIRPORT,GOOD FOOD."
7081,Kinda cool and Spiacoys like a mall I would recommend for anyone visiting Alabama or is moving to alabama
7082,"I was the only person at the security line, which was really nice -- there's not a whole lot going on once you get past the checkpoint, but it's a nice, modern-looking facility"
7083,"Very fast security, it was not crowded at all. Maybe the nicest security I’ve ever interacted with. Everything was open that would be that time of day. I was very satisfied with the airport in BHM."
7084,Birmingham Airport is a little airport wedged in between a set of small mountains that is perfect for commerce.
7085,Much improved post-renovations. Actually more than tolerable now!
7090,I love this airport. It’s not too big so the time from baggage drop to the gate takes very little time. Security is quick and easy. Best of all the TSA agents are generally all really nice and down to earth. Plenty of food options and wifi is super fast. It’s a low key place that operates with big airport efficiency.
7091,"Smaller airport but very nice, clean, well kept and easy to get from check-in to the gate. I really enjoy traveling in/out of Boise Gowen Fld."
7092,"Boise Airport is small, easy to navigate and spacious enough for the size of crowds transiting this facility. No large planes coming/going... all 737 / A320's and smaller commuter jets and turbo props, like Horizon Air."
7093,"Easy to navigate as it is a very small airport. The rental car return location was within a walking distance of the terminal so it made convenient to get to the airport. Great airport to fly out of, food is a little less as you only have 2-3 selections to choose from but overall a nice little airport."
7094,"I am local to this airport, so I don't really stay there for very long, but in my stay there, I have found a nice terminal with some food options, and I don't really get why you can polish your shoes there. Nice airport in general, can't wait to see an expansion!"
7096,"PRICES ARE RIGHT, OLD AIRPORT BUT NICE WELL KEPT."
7097,"The new Delta lounge in Terminal E is one of the best lounges I've ever been to. Great views of Boston, huge space with high ceilings, private spaces, and showers."
7098,"Review is limited to Terminal A. Haven't flown through this terminal in over a decade but it remains a very modern airport terminal with spacious seating, windows overlook tarmac and easy directions. Arrival was at the A12-A21 concourse which is accessible via a long underground walkway beneath the tarmac. Departure was from main terminal concourse. Plenty of dining options at both concourses. Terminal was very busy given the snowstorm and delayed flights. WiFi was easy to log onto and fast. Kudos to Logan airport snow clearing crews and the crews de-icing planes. Our flight to DFW was delayed but we managed to take off. Throughout the storm planes kept taking off and landing."
7099,"Upon arrival we had to grab our bags, go to a different building (go outside first) and through strange hallways, we got to the JetBlue area, where we had to re-check the bags and go through security again. We had 50 minutes between arrival and the doors closing for the next flight. Luckily we had Global Entry."
7100,"Compared to JFK which I flew put of in July, Boston terminal C was so much better in terms of security check. It literally took me a maximum of 5 mins to get through with no queues. However, there was quite a trek to get to the main duty-free areas from the gates and there wasn't many facilities."
7101,"I have been to Boston Logan Airport many times, normally to watch planes. But I don’t go to Logan Airport to fly a plane often. The airport is easy to get to with easy to understand signage on the road. I like this airport! Keep up the good work!"
7103,"First time traveling through Terminal B since its refurbishment. Once you clear security, one enters a new Great Hall with 75,000 sq feet of new space and 70,000 sq feet of existing space. All gates connect post security. The refurbished space is a world class modern airport terminal. It is spacious, brightly lit with plenty of seating and dining options aplenty. There are oodles of power ports and USB ports in the dining area. Bathrooms have occupancy lights and were generally clean for the most part. WiFi connectivity was okay. The concourses are wide and directions easy to follow. However the area near my departure gate was rather narrow and very crowded"
7104,Boston Logan is an ok airport and is sort of easy to navigate. They have an extremely long wait time in customs so if you have a short layover you are screwed.
7105,"Always a pleasure traveling through Logan - the only down side is the fact that immigration lines are always long - at least an hour! but the staff handle it well and as a positive, your checked bags are always waiting for you by the time you get through!"
7106,"Boston Logan Airport is Probably One of the Best Airports on the East Coast, perfectly placed in Boston and accessible by Public Transport"
7107,"Very pretty, western/log cabin feel with lots of warm woods, carpet, and local art. Smaller regional airport with two terminals/12 gates. No lounges but a couple of restaurant/bars and gift shops. TSA only has 4 lanes and can take a while when it's busy."
7108,"Beautiful, small, modern airport, Western decor. Rental garage attached to terminal, super easy to get out and in, fast TSA. A++"
7109,"Very friendly people and very lovely airport, though short time staying here and believe that we will be here again when go to Yellowstone then. Hope that everything could remain after decades of years, love this airport so much."
7111,"Did not spend much time here but overall it was pretty good. Also, WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY does this have to be 100 characters long?"
7112,"Overall good facilities, a very nice modern feel and great views of aircraft parked at the terminal. There are plenty of food options for travelers waiting for a departing flight, and lines are very short if you arrive early for your flight. I arrived about an hour and a half early for my flight and there was literally no line for TSA or most food options, with the exception being Tim Hortons, which had a short line that quickly grew into a line long enough to deter most other passengers from getting coffee. All in all, I love flying out of Buffalo and have no real complaints about this wonderful airport."
7113,"They stopped selling the Intense Milk chocolate milk, quite upset. other than that, the experience was great, and if you get there early, most people are checking bags so you can slide through security very easily."
7114,Very well run airport with wide concourses and lots of seating. Plus they have the original buffalo wing.
7115,"Easy terminal to navigate, current amenities are sufficient for an airport of this size but could definitely use a refresh (seating, flooring, walls, lighting, etc)... The new lounge is a welcome addition, albeit somewhat hindering if you're apart of any airline rewards program with lounge access, as this lounge is not compatible with any membership but has its own program..."
7116,"Very little information was provided on delayed and cancelled flights on screens. If you didn't hear announcement, it was very difficult to get more information. On screen was only indicated delay, but no time whatsoever. On screen at the gate were commercials, but no information on flight or delay."
7117,"Getting to the airport was OK, nice NFTA bus service from downtown (line 24), very efficient and for just $2. Check-in machine was not reading my passport and do not accept my reservation number, but check-in at the counter was very fast and efficient with a big added smile. Good points for the Delta. Security is bad at Buffalo, I have not been selected for TSA-Pre (unlike on JFK two days before) and went through normal procedure. Even worse, this was my second time departing from BUF and again a special precautions have been applied to me. But finally everything was OK. 45' complimentary Wi-Fi worked OK and is more than enough for waiting at such small, familiar and straightforward airport."
7118,Wonderful airport!! Very friendly staff!! Helped me find the Anchor Bar had the best chicken wings ever!! This airport was very clean and easy to navigate!! Two thumbs up for Buffalo!! Will be happy to get back here again soon!!!!!
7121,1st time to Burbank and i loved it. i love small airports like this. where the taxi from runway to gate when laning is less than a minute and the taxi from take gate to runway on take-off is less than 5 minutes and also this is mostly a turn an burn airport on take off. where they do not even stop when the get to the end off the runway they just turn around a start the take off roll. not even bother to stop.
7122,"Absolutely love everything about Burbank, just wish there was more food options within the terminals."
7123,Friendly staff and a very easy to maneuver airport that is people friendly. My only discrepancy against BUR is I wish there was more food options.
7124,"Easy and convenient LA area airport with plenty of carries offering great non-stop or one-stop destinations. Food and retail options leave something to be desired, but there is a renovation coming sometime soon."
7125,"I have wanted to fly out of this airport for years and finally got the chance and it lived up to the hype, somewhat. I will get the negative out of the way first and say the interior is outdated. That is my only complaint. It is clean, the staff was extremely helpful and friendly and the airport is very easy to navigate. Parking was not an issue at all as well. It also has a surprisingly wide array of food options for how small it is."
7126,Tiny Airport. Super easy. Smooth security. Only complaint is the painfully expensive concessions/restaurants.
7127,"Good little airport very convenient, but more expensive to fly out of. It's cool the terminal is right next to the runway. The terminal has the small town feel due to its size, parking is easy compared to LAX, but it's limited on the size of aircraft that can land so you most likely won't see anything bigger than a 737 there."
7129,Great views of landing aircraft onto runway 8 from Viineland Ave. See http://www.panoramio.com/photo/54446968
7130,Small and with free WiFi
7135,"Very few food options, the one bar charged $0.85 for tap water which I think is actually illegal in the United States. The food was extremely overpriced and bad. There was no lounge option and the wifi was spotty. They are building an extension so hopefully that will give better retail and food options"
7136,"It is what a regional airport should be. Up to date facilities. Walk to/from car rental lots. Strong WiFi. During peak times, TSA should have a dedicated ID checker for PREV customers."
7137,Small airport so not a lot of food options. The one sports bar is nice and the whole place is super clean. Never a long line to get through security.
7138,"The Cedar Rapids Airport, is a friendly airport, that makes its flyers feel at home. It features many lounges and includes multiple charging stations all around. This airport serves its guest by having a couple of resturants scattered around the area, while maintaining speed during chek-in / TSA / Boarding & Deplaning. I deffinetly recomend the Eastern Iowa Airport."
7139,ULTRA quick through security.
7140,Great airport to transfer through. Both concourses at CHS are connected via a post-security walk-way. Was able to check in for my next flight at the desk at the gate instead of having to re-clear security.
7141,Charleston was a really cool airport to visit since Boeing has a factory on the airport. Our flight was delayed and the airport shuts down at around 6pm.
7142,I was pretty impressed at CHS. Very clean and open; lots of natural light. TSA was quick and friendly. Decent dining options.
7143,"Charleston airport is nice and quaint. Not too busy, very walkable with fine restaurant choice, and great views inside and outside the terminal!!"
7145,"Lots of noisy reconstrution wotk at the moment , hire car parking is an uphill walk to the terminal . Best coffee is before TSA . Would be interesting to see after the work is compleated .Plenty of staff are doing good work despite the rebuilding ."
7147,"Overall a nice airport, but generally overcrowded often for as tight as the gates are at the end of B & C gates. Large lounge between C & D, but is packed often making the lounge worthless."
7148,"Short transfer and it was a breeze, seemed a well thought out airport. Would happily travel through it again."
7149,"Fairly cramped main terminal area, even in the American areas, which is surprising for a hub. The Centurion Lounge is nice, though limited for space, which resulted in a roughly 30-minute wait."
7150,"Clean, great food options and easy to navigate. This is probably the best airport in the Southeastern USA"
7151,Lot of construction at entrance and ticketing. Security checkpoint is a little overwhelming. Give yourself extra time. One inside terminals it was all good.
7152,"Charlotte Airport is quite interesting, it's infested with American jets and clean, and it has nice waiting zones for your airplane."
7153,Easy to navigate airport if it is your departure/destination airport with lots of construction going on to help expand the airport. The free WiFi in The Club CLT and in the general terminal worked well.
7154,Poor Public transport to the airport but traffic is normally not that bad. Check in and security can range from 5-15ms depending on various factors. Terminal is okay. AA lounge is good by American Airlines standards and has an airport view.
7157,"Wonderful entrance into the system, TSA easy, great wifi and bar/restaurant, parking a bit expensive, phone/computer charging stations everywhere"
7158,Flew my discovery flight out of here and the taxiways were very smooth and we felt small against the crj-200s. XD
7159,They have redone the airport and the bar is bigger and there is tons of working space with outlets everywhere. They did a great job.
7160,slow luggage
7161,Had an observation area and clean restrooms. UVA themed.
7162,The modernization of CHA makes it look a lot cleaner and nicer. The staff is still as friendly as always and it is easy to navigate.
7163,Very clean and a very nice quaint little airport with friendly staff. The only issue is the food option is a little underwhelming with only three places to eat i believe which is acceptable for such a small airport.
7164,"Small and very easy to navigate, took about 10 minutes from checkin to getting to my gate. Few small shops and eateries on airside. TSA was very quick. Staff was nice. Only complaint is it was a bit outdated."
7165,"I always love flying through MDW. Very passenger-friendly. A lot of the concessions spots have been revamped to really nice, delicious places. Always enjoy going through."
7166,Dropped from auto rental transport on ground floor and necessary to get to 3rd floor for departure ticketing then down to 2nd level for security and departure gates. New equipment at security and no need to remove shoes or computers from carry on…nice!
7169,"Security is long and a lot of traffic getting there. Overall, good airport for the Chicago area and a better smaller option than O'hare."
7170,"MDW is the better of the Chicago airports speaking strictly from a passenger standpoint. Security lines quick enough, not too crowded, solid enough concessions, easy to get around. Should be the baseline for airports of similar size."
7171,"KMDW is among my favorite airports to use as a passenger. Shortest security lines I've ever seen on a consistent basis, and the new TSA checkpoint upgrade will help. Has a small/cozy enough feel, plenty of quality places to eat."
7172,"Baggage claim was loud due to construction, but it is a positive that they are redesigning the older parts of Midway"
7173,MDW desperately needs some new airlines to fly here. Good move by Volaris and Delta to stay faithful to the airport and not completely move all their flights to ORD.
7174,"An older airport, Midway is still well maintained. It does have decent food and drink options, though many are closed for the pandemic still. Bathrooms are small and feel like those of a middle school, but they work. Fair amount of seating at the gates but again doesn't feel like it presently with many unavailable for social distancing. Overall, it's a decent airport still and great for plane watching, which I truly appreciate."
7176,"I have TSA precheck and my dad drives me to the airport, but it was still smooth sailing at ORD. But did you really fly through ORD if you didn't get dropped off at the wrong side of the airport?"
7177,"The line for customs was long but moved fast enough. The baggage claim wait took a while, over 45 minutes for the bags to come out. But other than that it was OK."
7178,"Delta moving to the International Terminal is a major improvement; Delta used to be tucked in the worst corner of the airport. The new SkyClub at ORD, accordingly, is lovely; it's huge, has multiple buffets, and a Chicago hot dog cart!"
7179,"This was my 2nd time flying out of O’Hare, it was a very nice airport and easy to find our terminal. I recommend arriving 1-2 hours before you flight since as it’s an international airport security can be long. But for us security was quick, if you have kids I recommend flying over night ( like I did ) as it can help pass the time instead of having a kid confined to a seat for 8 hours."
7181,"O'hare is a great airport, and even though it's massive, the facilities are still decently clean, especially in the new terminals."
7182,"I got to take the Terminal C to B tunnel, which is always a fun experience at ORD. As always, lots of retail and decently clean."
7183,"Great airport for transit passengers. There are food options that suits everyone in Terminal 5. The security checking was great, but make sure to be on time as the lines get pretty long."
7184,"As a Canadian, I thought the airports in the USA were terrible and old, but O'Hare blew me away. The architecture, the music and food were so great. If you make a transit in the US from an international trip, choose O'Hare over JFK."
7185,"They do have wifi, but access it you have to put in your name, email, and postcode. I would recommend getting wifi from some of the restaurants."
7186,"Getting To Airport: Traffic was light but quick and easy to get there. Check-In: Check-In went smooth and fast, agents were helpful and kind Security: Security went by fast considering it was a morning flight but TSA agents were nice and easy Terminals: Terminal was easy to navigate and clean. It was not crowded and had plenty of things around WiFi: WiFi ran smooth but had some lags in between :/ Food/Retail: Plenty of options however most were closed :( Lounge: No lounge that I could find :("
7189,"No seperate , fast track for business travelers is biggest disadvantage of CVG. Food services could be better."
7190,"So I flew in, and came back. Getting there was fairly easy, but it was not directly there like I came from BWI. The Terminal can be a bit Empty, but are very nice, Empty because Delta owns a whole Terminal, but has slowly stopped using it as much. Food is good and fast. WiFi is decent. Overall a pretty good airport, 4/5. Theres also an automatic train to get you from one place to the next within the airport."
7191,"Near-complete lack of public transportation from dowtown Cincinnati is just totally inappropriate these days. Otherwise very nice, clean and enjoyable regional airport with the right level of services."
7192,"Pretty empty, small enough to navigate. Wait times are pretty low, 10 mins or so. Still options for shopping, and eating. Only airport domestically whose tram isn't on wheels, which makes it fast, and more smooth."
7193,"Nice airport, easy to get around."
7194,I wouldn't say this place needs updating at all... It is one of the nicest Airports I have ever flown to. What it needs is more contracts with airlines
7195,"Needs some improvements. Easy to navigate. Various food options, but wish there were more amenities. The concourse hallways are small and aging. Security is tight unless you have PreCheck, and even then the majority of people don't have it and are holding everyone who does have it up. Plenty of food options for the airport's size. Bathrooms need cleaning and increasing."
7196,The airport was easily accessible and fast for unloading baggage. The check in was very efficient. The security check only had two officers so it took 1/2 an hour. There were many good food options. The lounge had many seats but they allowed people to move to the other gate's seating area if it got too crowded.
7197,Cleveland Hopkins is a small airport but very clean. It was nice and the people were kind and helpful.
7198,"At least it's not Detroit! Fitting a 777-300er into CLE is hilariously out of place, but made the hub hop more fun."
7199,"Very outdated and long overdue for modernization. However, the airport is easy to navigate, security is generally well managed and United has a comfortable lounge."
7200,I remain puzzled as to why the airport requires long-term parking shuttles to pick up and drop off so remotely. Not convenient and looks shoddy.
7201,"CLE is my home base and therefore am rather partial. However, for ease of security, decent amenities and a very comfortable United Club facility I find traveling in and out of Hopkins low-stress and enjoyable."
7203,"The check-in and facility was alright. Though a couple things needed repairing and there wasn't a lot of staff around, it felt very peaceful and relaxed due to the general lack of people around compared to hubs like O'Hare."
7204,"This airport is connected to the city (and points east) via light rail. As a local resident, this is very helpful because it allows me to park offsite for free and take the train to the airport for a fraction of the cost of parking onsite. The wifi was reliable and quick (downloads went fast and it was reliable enough for me to take and online quiz for one of my classes). The airport itself is OK. Decent food options (there are a few sit down places in addition to fast food - check out local option Great Lakes Brewery) and the usual shopping places. The United Club is very underutilized since this airport was dehubbed, so the club was quite nice and there was plenty of room to stretch out or charge a device. Baggage claim area is fine; the speed of delivery really depends on the airline. For me, it's been anywhere from 10 minutes to 40 minutes waiting. Suggestion: If multiple flights are picking up bags and you are getting picked up at the airport, consider departing from Departures (upstairs) which is almost always less crowded."
7208,"Always an easy in here at Columbia. Fast check-in, fast security and boom. Do wish that the retail locations stayed open a bit longer."
7210,Very nice staff. Quaint little airport with easy check in and very aesthetically pleasing. Clean and has nice foodcourt.
7211,"Airport was clean and thorough. The food choices were great, all of the staff were friendly. Wifi was solid"
7214,"Small-feeling airport for a large city. Easy and quick to get through security. No hassle from check-in through to the gate. But because CMH isn't a large airport, it lacks many facilities like lounges and wide variety in places to eat and drink."
7215,"I was randomly selected for a bag search. I get it, but the place was busy and packed and they were frisking another guy who was TSA Prechecked. That is holding shit up, and we are both TSA Precheck."
7216,A nice sized airport for Class C airspace. It’s easy to get off the plane and get baggage claim.
7217,"Very interesting terminal layout, essentially making it a hallway. Decent food/retail amenities at CMH."
7218,"Columbus was good. Check in was easy but the people behind the counter were aggressive with the bags. I saw a lot of angry passengers. Security was easy and fast. The terminal was ok but a lot of shops were closed. The wifi was pretty bad for a small airport. There was a small news store and it had a lot. The seating near the gate was like any four star airport. Lame, no outlets near the windows. Non comfy. Overall I am going to give it a four."
7219,CMH is my home airport. Decently sized regional airport. Don't expect to see very many boeing or airbus planes. Mostly CRJ or ERJ aircraft.
7220,"No airline has a lounge here, and there is no 3rd party one either. We have Starbucks and a Johnny Rockets. The airport definitely could use a few perks."
7221,"Airport is close to the city and easy to get to by car, taxi, or from downtown by the new AirConnect COTA bus. Terminal is refreshed and is quite nice. WiFi and power throughout the terminal is also a plus. Security lines and check-in lines are always fairly short so you don't have to get to the airport too far in advance. The staff at the airport, including TSA, are generally quite friendly, which is generally not the norm for the industry. The dining and retail options are limited, but there are some good options and finding something to eat or a basic travel necessity shouldn't be difficult. If a flight is arriving late or departing early finding food or shops open is quite difficult. Overall a very nice airport."
7222,"The airport is nice, security is very quick and they are quite professional. Gate staff is friendly as well and the area is well-maintained."
7224,Airport was clean and there was a very good selection of food and beverage with the many restaurants. Quite busy and lack of charging stations. TSA line was reasonable.
7226,"Not a lot to write home about in terms of great facilities, but it's relatively easy to get around this massive airport that's all connected airside with a well-run people-mover."
7227,"Departure and Arrival for roundtrip was from Terminal E. One of the best things about DFW is the parking garages across from the terminal. I was able to park directly across from the TSA Pre entry area. This is my favorite terminal. For a midday departure, the airport was busy but not overcrowded thanks to the wide concourses and spacious seating areas. Dining options are plentiful. This is my favorite terminal at DFW. WiFi was easy to connect too and very fast. Bathrooms were very clean."
7228,"Dfw has always been a walk in the park for security, no matter what terminal I go to it seems I am to my gate within minutes. Now delays are a different story, out of the several times I have flown out of this airport, not one has been close to on time."
7229,"The national departure area is very confusing. Everything was overcrowded, confusing and it was not possible to get tickets next to each other even if you showed up on time."
7230,"Departure from Terminal C. Usually Terminal C is very crowded; however, given the early hour of my outbound flight, the terminal was not too busy. Got through security with a minimal wait time courtesy of TSA Pre privileges. I can't rate any dining options as they were closed given my early departure 5:30 a.m. Inbound flight arrival was at Terminal E my favorite terminal. Both Terminal C and E have wide open concourses and plenty of dining options. The terminal is brightly lit with a wide open concourse and plenty of dining options charging points at every gate. Lavatories were clean. I can't rate WiFi as I did not connect to it."
7232,"Best airport I have ever been to. Great food options, long walk though. Terminal C is a bit dingy, but I hear it will be getting renovated soon."
7233,I loved ariving at this airport the tram system took me across the airport fairly quickly and the 7/11 there was cheap.
7234,"I had no idea that airports could close, and then Southwest got me here past midnight, I got there to a closed airport."
7235,"It's been 4 years since I flew out of this airport. The terminal is bright, spacious and has plenty of windows through which to see the airfield. Surprisingly, the airport was not very crowded on the Friday before Labor Day. There was plenty of seating at the gates. The airport has added new dining options from sit down restaurants to fast food. The only drawback to this airport is the lack of bathrooms. The bathrooms are small and there are only 3 stalls in each of the men's bathrooms. This is the same critique I had 4 years ago when I last flew out of this airport. Given the number of passengers that fly through the airport daily, renovating and/or expanding bathrooms should be considered."
7236,"DAL is a great airport, All tho parking may bit of a walk getting in the airport primarily ran by Southwest. Walks to the gate are not long, There are great Retail services around, Wifi could use a little more speed but Overall Great (Using it to write this). Security Check was a bit long for new travelers but you will get used to it, Lounge has Outlets every other seat so charging was a non-issue, living in the Parenting City of MCI this airport is better in my Opinion."
7237,"Airport layout was easy to understand and made it easy to find what you needed. There was plenty of parking and Garage C has a skybridge on level 3 that goes straight to check-in and security. The general security line was long, but TSA PreCheck and the priority line were empty. After security, finding your gate and boarding the plane was simple & easy."
7238,"Dallas Love Filed has turned into a great airport, it's very travel friendly and is just great overall !"
7239,"Very small tiny airport, essentially ghost town at night, but it's nice to have a close back up to cvg"
7240,This airport is small enough to be comfortable but not isolated from the world with very interesting connections to the major hubs
7241,"Convenient and cheap, just old and dated."
7243,"The Daytona Beach airport is a very lovely and clean airport. Each gate has ample seating, there is plenty of sunlight that shines through the large skylights and large windows by the gates. Considering the size of the airport, the food and shopping options are small but nice! Getting to the airport if you don't have a car or are not renting is rather annoying since there are only two bus lines that serve the terminal and they mainly run on an hourly schedule so if you get in at a time inconvenient to the bus schedule and don't have a friend to pick you up you're basically forced to use uber/lyft"
7244,I like the new renovations a lot but the new carpet blends with the walls making it very very bright.
7245,"Nice airport, I like it! It's very convenient to get there, and since it's not one of those giant airport, you'll know where you need to go in a short time."
7246,TINY!!
7247,"DIA is looking a little worse for wear these days; it's still well laid-out and convenient to get between terminals, but the signage and extensive carpeting is dated. Delta is not the highlight here (e.g., no SkyClub) but the Centurion Lounge was expansive and had some regional character. We also didn't have to wait in line to get in, which was a huge plus."
7249,"I arrived From ICT (Wichita, KS) So I don't really know anything about check-in or security check. I only go there Because ICT and SLC don't have connecting flights."
7250,"Sorry, I am unsure about if the baggage claim is good, because I only took a carry-on Also I had a flight to SLC (Salt Lake City) airport after My flight from DEN."
7251,Going through immigration very quickly. No waiting time. But the suitcase didn't come. Suitcases left about 10 minutes after I went through immigration.
7253,Very hard and chaotic to get throught security had to arrive 4 hours early because security took a hour to get through.
7254,It’s a large airport but easy to navigate. Nice rest areas at terminals. Bathrooms are beautiful and well maintained.
7255,"Really fast with C Checkin and Bridge Security! It took about half an hour to get past Siko. United Lounge surprisingly good, pretty new too. You can definitely go there again ;D"
7256,"Great airport overall, could use a little more signage in the check in area. Everything else was amazing, especially the remodeled parts of the terminal!"
7257,"KDSM is my home airport. It is an international airport that celebrities often use as there port of entry because it is far less busy within Customs (located outside the main terminal). Terminal is on the smaller size but with multiple flights leaving out every day, it is usually very busy - especially in the morning. No lounge space here. Airport is hoping to double the amount of gates within the next 10 years which will help broaden the scope of travel to the DSM area."
7258,Baggage claim has greatly improved from a year ago! Back to the speed it used to be and belongs. Nice job!
7259,"DSM is a small airport, so there are very few hassles making your way in or out. Curb to gate in 20 minutes or less is possible if you're not checking a bag, and gate to curb gets you out of there in 5 minutes. Beware arriving in DSM after 21:00 if you expect to rent a vehicle, the rental service counters may be closed for the night; best to call ahead. Good prices on Cyclone/Hawkeye tees at the shop in the terminal pre-security."
7263,"Just arriving late at night, not seen much of airport... but they announced luggage on one carousel and the it was on another one... and getting a taxi is not easy, you have to walk a lot to taxi area and service is not very ""comfortable"" late at night..."
7265,"A very easy airport, sky train in delta terminal. I would recommend for convenience and great stores."
7266,"One of the best laid-out airports in the U.S., with great SkyClubs. Easy to navigate, while huge, and with great options for Delta flights all over the country and the world."
7267,"Having been here as much as I have, this airport never disappoints. Never too crowded, efficient, and the best airport that I've been to in my opinion. Well done."
7268,"KLM lost my bag in Amsterdam, got delivered Sunday Night - Later than it should have, got 5,000 SkyMiles as a result of this delay"
7269,"Oh, Detroit, good ol' Detroit. everything other then the baggage was good. But baggage was awful, after i had grabbed my baggage I had to figure out how to re enter the airport.there was no directory or anything. I spent more time figuring out how to get in then inside."
7271,"The airport's not too bad for the immigration customs when you come here. Lines will take a long time but you shouldn't worry about it that much, you'll get to the baggage claim which takes a lot of time. But the worst part I got at the airport was the delay on an American Airlines flight. TSA wasn't available until maybe hours or so before the flight departed from DTW."
7272,TSA security was problematic with our duty free alcoholic item that we brought in. We finally just checked it with the airline after they made a fuss.
7273,The baggage claim for international flights was very slow. It took almost 45 minutes from arrival to get the bags. Then the bag transfer wasn't very clear.
7274,"So, I am not a bad person but i put a camera in a wine bag and on the way back from RSW they found a wine bottle opener witch the TSA at DTW did not see witch was scary"
7280,"A small but well-run airport serving an important market. One thing to note is that TSA is legendarily strict because of the number of flights to Mexico/Central America, so allow extra time and make sure you don't have anything that could get your bag inspected. Decent options on American and United, only option for Delta is to ATL."
7281,"This airport is surprisingly busy for it's size and location. Very friendly staff at check in, security and at the gates. Past security, there are multiple food options for most any tastes. No lounge, but given it's size and passenger count, this shouldn't be expected. If flying Delta, you're only connection is ATL. If you're flying United you can fly into DEN, IAH and ORD. If flying American you can fly LAX, PHX, DFW, ORD at present. AUS will be discontinued in Feb. If sticking to OneWorld, you can fly Alaska to SEA with evening flights."
7282,El Paso recently introduced a new parking system that is tedious to handle and a tad difficult if you don’t know how to use it they need to introduce a tutorial on how to work the thing.
7283,"Needs better food options. For as small as this airport is, luggage takes quite a while to get out tot he carousel. ELP has a number of shortcomings, but all in all, it's an extremely easy airport to go thru."
7284,NO COMMENT
7291,"Fairbanks is a very nice little airport, you often see people meeting someone they know there because of the small Alaska community. It has a nice coffeeshop and restaurant and bar with a good varity and opening hours compared to the airports small size. When arriving at the airport you have a 2 min walk to leave the airport. If you have bagage you pick that up in the terminal. I can only recommend the airport. Easy in and out with good facilities and parking right in front of the terminal."
7292,"Baggage claim was a bit disorganized, but bags arrived faster than at some. Cool exhibits, taxidermies, etc. all around."
7293,"I just love the airport, and how getting through security is faster than with Clear at some airports"
7294,"A very nice airport for a market this size. TSA even efficient and FRIENDLY!!! Clean airport, but suffers from a common problem encountered in Fairbanks, insanely slow Wi-Fi connections. Put one full flight worth of passengers in the lounge and the speeds plummet to dial up in an instant."
7295,Its a little shocking to realize that the body of water running parallel to your runway is actually a Sea Plane base and that it is in use as you taxi to the gate. You also realize where you are when you taxi to the gate past half a dozen aircraft that are older than you and still in daily service. Fairbanks is a six gate facility with the bare necessities on the edge of the Arctic Circle.
7296,Was delayed an hour de-icing the aircraft because of a shortage of staff. The gate agent was very friendly though.
7297,Really nice small airport! I loved it the moment I walked off the jetway... It has a small town feel to it!
7298,I really like flying out of FAR with it being a smaller airport. Quick check-in and usually a fairly small security line. Enjoy flying out of the smaller airports.
7299,"A great small airport, security is always a breeze and the gate areas are updated and comfortable. Hope more airlines start flying here!"
7301,NEEDS SOME UPDATEING.
7305,We landed at 8:00PM and were connecting for a midnight departure. There was a single restaurant open at that time (closed at 9:00).
7306,In order to transfer airlines you have to exit security and walk outside to the other terminals. It was a pain especially with a short connection time.
7308,"It's been 11 years since I traveled through Terminal 1. The refurbished Terminal 1 is a world class modern airport terminal. It is spacious, brightly lit with plenty of seating and dining options aplenty. There are oodles of power ports and USB ports at the gates; however, some of the power ports were not working. Bathrooms are very clean. The concourses are wide and directions easy to follow to baggage claim. Security was a breeze with no wait time for the TSA-Pre checkpoints. WiFi was easy to connect too and blazing fast. The refurbished terminal is a significant upgrade to the old terminal 1"
7309,The WIFI was pretty good and the airport was clean and nice though a bit busy in the terminal and also unorganized security ( Nearly lost bag )
7310,"Security was long, but very fluid, got through fast. Lots of facilities, bought a plane model and went to a restaurant."
7311,It’s really just a ton of outdated buildings with a ton of restaurant that close at 9:00 PM with barely any seating. Avoid at all costs!
7313,"FLL is my home airport. Check in took a while as Air Canada messed up my family’s boarding passes. Security people were a bit rude, and kept sending us back to get our boarding passes fixed. The terminal before TSA is EXTREMELY outdated. It needs an update."
7314,"This was my first time flying out of FLL, and it was a refreshing change from the decrepit state of MIA. The terminal is much nicer and it's a far shorter journey through security to planeside. The Delta SkyClub is small and cozy, and immediately above Gates D7-D9, offering a nice view of the terminal area below."
7322,"Airport is very small and efficient. Not a big check in area but they were very good. Small security however fast. On the other side there is only one store, a bar and retail shop combined. 2 vending machines near the toilets and a water fountain. Airport was bright and spacious for a terminal of that size. Great wifi, however not so comfortable waiting chairs. Would definitely fly out of GFK again!"
7323,"You have to take GFK for what it is, small. You aren't going to have the luxuries of the major hubs. What it offers is a fast check in, fast security, and a comfortable terminal with wifi."
7324,"I found the GFK airport to be quite easy to go fly out of. The airport was small, as expected, so there was little discrepancy as to where to go."
7325,"While small, GRR was an extremely clean airport. They had free Wi-Fi, but very minimal food and retail."
7326,"While small, GRR was an extremely clean airport. They had free Wi-Fi, but very minimal food and retail."
7327,"No real public transit options, however pickup/drop off area is easy and plenty of parking. Security is nice and quick. The terminal is also very nice, however food options can feel a little limited."
7328,"Once I landed, the airport was nothing much to look at but once you step inside, it's a very nice airport. The parking lot is also very nice and spacious."
7329,"The good thing about this airport is that it is small, very easy to navigate, very little signage is required. Not a lot of food amenities, there's a Starbucks and a small restaurant but that's expected from a small airport. The airport has just undergone a big renovation project that really renovated the parking garage, added a roof to the top floor, and the sky bridge provides convenient access to the terminal from the upper levels. Main lounge is small but adequate, and has an array of small amenities like an ATM, shoe shine, a small conference room, etc. Security is one of the positives of this airport. There aren't a lot of travelers during most parts of the day so the security line it next to nothing. Nothing at all if you have Pre-Check. Terminal layout after security is very simple and small. 7 gates in A, 8 gates in B. All along a simple corridor with small shops and coffee along the way. Average delay is only 5 minutes for any given flight. Overall, this is a great local airport, located a convenient 13 miles (21km) from downtown Grand Rapids. The airport has a good punctuality, good parking, very easy navigation, and a very hassle-free experience unlike that of the modern airport."
7330,Nice small airport. Everyone was friendly and easy to walk around.
7334,"The security guard checking bags was extremely old and it felt like it was a training ground for older TSA agents which is good, but there needed to be some more trainers their."
7335,PTI definitely shows its age a bit. Not a lot in terms of food or retail at least on the south wing. Looks outdated in general. Friendly staff and good Wifi tho.
7336,Headed to Europe for vacation! Little did I know this would be my final trip for awhile due to Covid and a bad marriage.
7337,Its a good airport its small and easy to go to lines are not long for security and the longest wait time is check in
7338,NOT A BAD AIRPORT..
7339,small and reasonable prices.
7340,A quick transit from the arrival gate to the baggage claim whereby the bags were available shortly after arrival.
7341,"I love flying through this airport! They've added more food services, and they are adding a lot more parking this year (2020)."
7342,"Amazing Airport. Everything was really nicely kept up and looked recently remodeled. They also have a big outside area past security, so you can be outside while you wait for your flight."
7343,"Best regional airport in the United States. Easy in, easy out. Cheap (close) parking, and enough amenities."
7344,"Beautifully landscaped, new terminal. Easy rental car return, quick security, nice outdoor garden after security where you can watch takeoffs and landings. All in all a wonderful, small airport."
7345,"Easy to get in and out of, cheap to park, mostly friendly staff and a decent amount of service. Currently under reno."
7352,"I love coming to this airport! Bags delivered quickly, car rental was a snap! Feels almost like flying private!"
7353,"Really awesome airport. It is a very small airport with not many flights. Check in is super simple and there is plenty of staff to help. Security is one of the easiest I've been through. There are a couple restaurants and shops. Wifi works fine. There is a very small lounge that sometimes goes unstaffed, but overall it's nice enough. I would recommend this airport."
7360,"Open airport, so no windows but it can be noisy, humid, and hot shortly after leaving aircraft but got used to it/."
7362,Nice airport only thing is there was a long line and the line is outside but not a big deal because it’s warm. I just wish there was some more space
7363,Easy airport to navigate and security and signage were clear. Nice outside area enroute to United Airlines terminal
7364,Can't complain for the most part. One downfall was that it was a bit confusing to get to check-in from the rental car drop off area.
7365,"The KAL lounge here was not that great, but still, if you have access it would be a nice shelter for you until your flight."
7366,"My family connected to an island hopper Hawaiian Airlines flight, but the interline didn't go smooth and our bags were delayed significantly."
7367,Long walk from international arrival to domestic departure. A lot of the terminal is open-air. Signage to get to the customs bus was not great. Directions to customs once off the bus was lacking. Customs folks were pleasant and helpful
7368,"A simple burger king meal was $15 without drinks, very expensive. The outdoor walkway and humid environment provides a unique airport experience though."
7371,This airport is massive. Give yourself at least 2.5 hrs minimum to switch terminals and get connecting flights. Distance from gates to immigration in Terminal E is very long. Thanks to Mobile Passport Control we were able to get through immigration without any long lines. Terminal E is gorgeous. Can't rate food etc as I just transited through it. wiFi connection (free airpot) was excellent.
7372,Lots of construction. Few food options. Broken bathrooms. It’s sad… this airport used to be much better. Looking forward to new renovations.
7373,"The luggage was probably outside during the thunderstorm and got leifder very wet, including the contents!"
7374,A MEGA airport. Plan lots of time if you need to switch terminals for your connecting flight. Lots of places to eat.
7377,"Fairly smooth on arrival although every other aspect of this airport involved long wait times. The signage is terrible and I got lost more than once. Baggage took forever to make it to reclaim, and the rental cars are only accessible via a bus which doesn’t arrive frequently. While waiting for the bus you’re stuck out in the hot humid environment and there is no air conditioned waiting area."
7378,"Crowded like any other airport, good selection for food but not anything special, not a whole lot of seating at Terminals."
7379,"Nice airport, not much to say here easy to get to baggage claim. I was in the A gates. A little bit of a walk maybe like .5/.25 of a mile to the baggage claim."
7380,Terminal E is under construction and should be avoided at all costs if you have people picking you up. Hav them pick you up in Terminal C or A to avoid the traffic
7381,Excellent hub for SouthWest with Lots of nice staff Security check was the usual long line but it only took like 20 Mins. Not much else to say.
7382,"Terminal facilities were plentiful. Arrived at Hobby from Austin via connecting flight. As originally posted on the airport directory, gate for connection was one gate away. But, that was changed to one far away. That was frustrating, but obviouly, part of traveling. The seats weren't the most comfrtable either. An airport is an airport if it gets you there."
7383,Small little airport perfect to get into when your departing quickly or arriving quickly. Good selection of snacks.
7384,"My first time in Honby, almost missed the sign that says to baggage. Well actually I did miss it! But otherwise easy to navigate"
7385,"Security was very fast. Although my ticket wasn't even checked, and still had to remove my belt, in the precheck line"
7386,Quick and easy navigation through the airport with decent restaurant choices. There are several electric outlets available throughout the terminal area and Wifi is free. Unfortunately there is no lounge here
7387,"There is now a chick-fil-a in the Houston Hobby airport, it's located in the international gate area. I believe gates 1-5. Other than this your best food option is Buffalo Wild Wings. All opinion though because there are other places to eat such as Wendy's, Pappas Burgers, Subway and Papaduex seafood."
7388,"Small airport is convenient for getting in and out of. Bad options for food/drinks, one of the most expensive airports in the country. About 12 nonstop destinations."
7389,"One of my favorite things about the Huntsville Airport is the hotel that is attached to the airport. I didn't expect this for a smaller airport, and it was very nice."
7390,NICE AIRPORT FAST TURNAROUNDS GREAT FOOD..
7393,"First time at IND. Wonderful facility compared to all the Los Angeles area airports. Very open feel, very clean."
7394,TSA PRe Check is very slow here. Newer machines take forever to process. Only terminal A has pre-check
7395,"TSA security is not staffed to efficiently handle the flow of people. Having traveled through the airport frequently, there are always large queues after RealID check. Machines and staffing are rotated but persons leave area and wait for replacement. Suggestively, the replacement show up and then the person rotate."
7396,One of the best airports I’ve ever been too. They have exceptional service throughout the airport security lines are easy.
7397,"I've traveled to dozens of airports in my lifetime, and I have to say that little ol Indy is certainly one of the best in America. Its so easy to get through security, even recently when I forgot my ID! The staff have always been consistently friendly and on top of that the airport itself is very modern, exceptionally clean, and has plenty of dining and food options although at a decent expense. Overall, about as good as they get in America!"
7398,"Indianapolis International is ranked as one of the best airports in the United States for a reason. As always, super clean, security efficient, and super friendly place."
7399,"It is one spacious and lovely airport, and if you do happen to be late, crew and airport staff always put you first, and I just in general love the airport."
7400,IND Airport is fairly spacious and has several restaurants on the inside of the terminal. The inside seems to be very modern and spacious.
7401,"New clean spacious airport. It was weird to see the baggage claim after existing the air-side (same for all US airports). The airport wasn’t far from the city, 20mins by car."
7402,"Best airport overall in the US! Clean, efficient and short TSA lines. Only complaint is that their prices at restaurants are pretty high in my opinion."
7404,"Airport's on the edge of town. Took awhile to get our bags. Reason I put is a 4-star is because it's a small airport serving a small area, so for those purposes it's got what you need."
7405,Lady at the AA counter was pretty rude. Granted I showed up 10 min before the flight.. with a guitar
7406,Its a very efficient airport and getting through security is super easy. The TSA staff + plus checkin staff were very friendly. There is direct busses every 30 minutes from downtown Ithaca and is very accessible.
7407,The airport is pretty nice. I love small airports because they are easy to get into. The security line was quick and easy. One of the biggest problems is that there is barely any food there just a few little snack stores but nothing that big. Overall my experience was good. I love flying with delta
7408,"I first though that, due to its unfortunate location, that this airport would be a dump. I was very surprised by how clean and efficient this airport is! Only problem is the lack of many food options."
7409,"I had read that Jackson was ranked as one of the top airports, and was completely baffled that it could be ranked anywhere near the top. It's set up really oddly, there are no real restaurants past security. It's much smaller than I expected. While getting there isn't difficult, check in is quick, it's the general atmosphere of an airport with very few amenities. I would expect this for a smaller city, but Jackson seems like it should have more options."
7410,"I flew in from Washington D.C. When i got to the aiport, it was clean, the people were nice, and the wifi was pretty good. On a scale of 1-10 i would give it a 9.99 because the airport was fantastic."
7411,"TSA is extremely active in their work. All bags checked, bottles with liquids open and not closed afterwards. Stuff in the bags messed up. Be prepared that you will be ""X-rayed"" by personnal eyes. Spelling the of names in passport and ticket were not the same due to new transliteration rules for cyrillic, and only in JAN airport clerks paid attention."
7412,"Getting to the airport was super easy, even with offsite car rental, there was no trouble checking any bags and getting through security took about 5 minutes. The bathrooms were very clean and smelled good."
7413,"the view from landing/taking off of the tetons is so pretty, especially in the winter when the snow is falling, tetons in the back. although landing in winter/when it’s snowing can be very rough, it is still cool to experience that one airport in the national park."
7414,"By far one of the most beautiful airports I have ever been to. The whole terminal is coated in a rich oak wood, which perfectly sets the stage for a trip to Wyoming. Plus, you board from the ramp, which is an awesome experience."
7415,"Jackson Hole is the most unique, interesting, and cool airport I have flown to in the USA. Where else can you disembark outside and see the mountains a mile away?"
7416,"Very nicely built airport. It looks like it belongs in the snow. An arch made of antlers to greet passengers to the airport is a great touch. Now, the reason for the 4 stars is, this only applies if you are making a connection through Jackson, you have to exit security then go back through it. So, don't make tight connections here at Jackson."
7417,Fast TSA and boarding pass. Of course I was 3 1/2 hours early…lol. Only downfall was no electric plugs in the lounge seats. Had to use wall sockets. No big deal though.
7418,"Got from the parking lot to the gate in less than 15 minutes, which allowed me plenty of time to go for some much-needed bites before my flight took off -- would go here again if I had a chance"
7419,Pristine and nice terminal facilities. JAX could do better with the food and retail services in the terminal but I do like the aviation museum however.
7420,"JAX is a relatively small but great airport. It's nicely designed and welcoming to its passengers. Getting to the city is a bit of a challenge if you don't want to use Uber/Lyft or a taxi. There is a regular bus line that takes about one hour to get to downtown but from there you need to make arrangements to get to your final destination. Mind you, there are no taxis waiting at the Rosa Parks bus stop."
7422,"My home airport and always my favorite. I got here too early this trip - and found that there's nothing open past security, not even for coffee, before 5:00 AM and the Starbucks locations were not particularly prompt about opening on time (not the fault of the airport)."
7423,"I have reviewed JIA previously. Basically no difference - it's a real nice airport. It's small, but does all the important things well. Would be nice if there were more options for eating/shopping, especially early in the morning which is when I am usually flying, but hard to expect given the size."
7424,"I will always have a soft spot for Jacksonville International as it is the closest thing to my ""home"" airport. My trips all begin and end here. As such I've watched the place grow and improve over the years, and I've had lots of practice dealing with the things that are specific to this place - getting to and from the airport, parking, security, baggage claim, etc. JAX may be small, but it's really nice - clean, efficient, and easy to navigate. Food choices are decent (but not spectacular), WiFi works, bathrooms are plentiful and clean. Free shuttles to and from long-term parking are an amenity I use every trip. Check-in with various airlines is smooth. Security is what it is, but no worse than anywhere else. There are nice waiting areas near the gates with extra power plugs. In short - this is a good airport."
7429,"Flight in was awesome. Amazing view on final/approach. Nice international Airport, not to big. At bag claim it gave some travel tips."
7432,"hmm, don’t really remember this airport. i remember it not being busy, which is good of course for baggage claim, security, and more. i thought it was just a normal, small airport. last year is when i found out they fly 777 and 787 there! i couldn’t believe it and since then i liked it a bit better."
7433,The Kahului Airport badly needs an upgrade in facilities. It serves its purpose well but it’s looking really dated in the terminal and gate area. The TSA agent we dealt with in TSA Precheck was a complete asshole with a terrible attitude. He’s the kind of guy that gives the organization a bad name. No spirit of aloha there.
7434,Kahului is not the nicest airport. Not very clean and a bit cramped for the number of passengers traveling through.
7435,OGG is always a great airport to land at. Everyone is always very happy. The walk to the baggage terminal from anywhere in the airport is always under 10 minutes and when you get there airport employees are always very quick about getting your luggage on the carousel
7436,Getting through security could’ve been a long process. Thankfully I was a single parent traveling with two kids under 12 so I got the special treatment- no complaints other than we had to leave paradise.
7437,"very busy airport, new terminal under construction, so the upgrade should help a lot, waiting area for flights is very cramped hopefully this will be addressed in the new terminal as well as some more restaurants and shops to checkout while you wait"
7438,"This is an airport in which if you don't have pre-check, no big deal. You can still make it through in good time. Just plan ahead is what I always say. Don't wait until the last hour to get through with any TSA lines. I noticed both lines moved almost equally in terms of time."
7441,"One of the nicest, newest airport terminals around. Glass jet bridges are a very nice touch, allwoing you to see the ground crew and nearby planes as you wait to board. Plenty of amenities in the airport too."
7442,"New terminal is nice, can use more food options closer to the gates rather than just in the middle of the terminal"
7443,"The new airport in Kansas City has been a long time coming but it ticks all the boxes. Easy check-in, efficient security. Good art, reasonable volume, great amenities, outstanding lounge. This raises the bar for what a non-hub airport for a medium size city should be."
7444,"So very much better than it used to be! It’s no longer torture if you show up early or your flight is delayed. I got my bags checked and through security very quickly, had plenty of time for BBQ, beer, coffee, picking up some snacks for the hotel, and just wandering around. Very easy to navigate and so much room. Love it!"
7445,The new KCI (actual code MCI) terminal is absolutely gorgeous and incredibly convenient. Easy to navigate with tons of amenities and food/drink options. Cannot recommend this terminal highly enough. If you had ever visited the old KCI terminals you won’t even believe you’re at the same airport.
7449,"As always, quick departure from the plane to walking at MCI. But, the gate seemed to be the farthest from the baggage claim possible. Once bag found, I moved quickly outdoors. Within a couple of minutes, ""The Sport"" bus showed up and took me to the car. All most reasonable."
7452,Definitely liked the airport for it's a small size and the ability to walk outside to the airplane. Wish they could modernize the check and counters for scanning tickets off cell phones.
7453,"Definitely an odd layout. The baggage claim area is a little crammed, but the rest of the airport is really cool and really unique."
7454,Small. Not a lot of room in the terminal or food. Security was a bit slow. All flights board on air stars no jetways
7457,Super easy in and to the gate. TSA was very easy. Very little open late at night. Vending machines were hard to find.
7458,"Couldn't be any easier than this. Very easy to get from the gate to the curb, particularly without any checked luggage."
7459,"Modern regional airport with a good selection of food options from Ruby Tuesday to Quizno. Car rentals are in the paking struture across from the terminal so no need to board any shuttle, a major time saver. Also to access car returns, you go in front of the terminal, so you can easily drop off people. From there, you need to go up one level to get to Departures"
7460,"Airport is small and easy to navigate. However, very disappointed in ""Covid-Restricted"" food services. Most food retailers only open for 2 hour window during peak hours without regard for needs of the travelling public."
7461,KOA It’s the best little open air airport! I love the natural breeze and ramp views as you board and deplane via air stairs!
7463,I liked it! It was outside and nice with the wonderful Hawaiian weather. Taxiing and deplaning did take a while but that’s not the airports fault. Baggage claim was ok just took a while. I’ll rate Wi-Fi and food service on the way back
7466,"The rental car return shuttles were very full. The check in line at the airport took almost an hour because of the Portland Flight ahead of us, and as well as pets that were being shipped. I had to wait for almost an hour before I was helped. The airport is all outside, which means the weather is warm. The seating at the airport wasn't very comfortable."
7467,"The airport is outdoors. The weather there after arriving at the airport is very warm. Getting off the plane, there is no bridge. You have to walk to the airport. The baggage claim had a problem that day. It stopped several times before the luggage arrived."
7468,Charming open air airport in Hawaii settings. No airconditioned terminal or waiting rooms. Check-in to mainland is a little bit complicated walking up and down between check-in / vetenary check / bag drop.
7469,"Lovely outdoor airport, rustic with few amenities but great staff and quick service. We arrived as we normally do for international flights and found ourselves with 2 hours to spare. Do not come too early to this airport for checkin, they don't even open until 8am. No lounge to be found."
7475,"LAS is in desperate need of expansion. It's conveniently located, but always feels hectic inside. Delta should open a SkyClub here as it has plenty of flights and there are plenty of Delta passengers. The Centurion Lounge, while spacious and nice, was crowded due to the paucity of other lounge options."
7476,"The small business lounge offers a good view, a small bar and a good little buffet for breakfast."
7477,"At that time, I was treated like a criminal by the immigration officers from the Home Security Agency simply because I had entered the USA too often within the last 12 months"
7478,"It’s a great airport once you get to know it, just the naming should still be McCarran. It’s my home airport, so I got to know it over the years"
7479,"The new named Harry reid international it's an old airport well the terminal 1 part it is, while the crew works to maintain the installations clean is always dirty due to the vast amount of traffic that occurs at the airport. Filled with casinos and memorabilia of the old las vegas the airport has something for everybody. Terminal 3 being the international part is the most modern area in the entire airport. Parking is definitely an issue for employees as for travelers alike, plan ahead if you want to park here, food options are plenty but the prices is one of the things most people complain, you'll see all type of people in the airport, being vegas everything seems wild."
7480,"Average Airport not really great, the smell of cigars annoys me. It’s alright to get anywhere in the southwest."
7481,Huge with 3 terminals connected by trains. Terminal 3 and probably the other 2 do not offer enough seating with ac outlets. And the seating consists of rows of black chairs. It is dated by today standards. It's hard to find where the hotel shuttles pick up. Only in T1?
7482,"Location is convenient but it was really kinda trashy. Like I had second thoughts about taking my shoes off for security, and I set my phone down only to realize it was wet and gross. Fair amount of trash left around."
7484,"Terrible experience!!! Terminal 3 had one security line that made you walk about a half mile just to get to the front. The line of planes to get out was terrible and they only were taking off on one runway, Vagas needs another runway for how big they are."
7489,"Lihue definitely is in need of updating and upgrading, it was built for just two to three inter island airlines back in the 80’s but now they have multiple airlines with transpacific flights on a daily basis making the terminal outdated to accommodate those transpacific flights, just one restaurant which is expensive but the food is good but not the best , got a Starbucks and a lounge that is closed every time I am there."
7490,"First time riding United and it was very nice and fun! The food was cold but the ""ginger ale"" was nice"
7492,"Cute little ""International Airport"" on Kauai. Nice island feel - open to the air in most sections. Not very many shops, but the Starbucks is nice for early morning flights. No international flights except for the Westjet one to Vancouver, Canada."
7493,"Very pittoresque little airport on the Island of Kauai. Just outside you will see the local free going chickens in different colours. Open air facilities and piers, but built in gates with aircondition. Close to the town of Lihue. Facilities are generally good and staff friendly."
7495,Such a beautiful island!
7496,They have really updated the main terminal and streamlined the TSA process. Very good facility for a small airport
7497,"Lincoln Municipal Airport is quite small, but very comfortable and friendly airport. There is free WiFi, quite well working, high speed. Airport also offers complimentary coffee for passengers waiting for boarding in gate areas, which is not usual (so far I experienced complimentary coffee only once in FRA in 2012)."
7499,a very nice small airport. That has open seating in places so you can smell fresh air while you sit.
7500,"Great little airport! It's almost kind of cute. Only a handful of gates, two bag claims. Rental car locations are a couple hundred feet from the terminal. Would love to fly into here again."
7501,This is the easiest airport to fly in and out of! Simply the best. It’s got that “Catch me if you can” feel. Old school
7502,"Long beach is a very nice and small airport. My tip is, don’t book an early flight because lots of people will all be getting there at the same time due to the close departure times."
7503,"it’s a great airport because of it size, easy to get in and easy to get out. The best way to get there would probably be a lyft, uber, or a bus."
7504,Greatest smallest airport. Convenient and efficient with class. Living in Southern California I will always try to fly in and out of Long Beach.
7505,Great experience. New glass terminal looks sharp. Deplane to ground transportation in less than 5 min.
7506,Easy airport with little to no lines at security. Price for food is a bit high. Easy and laid back atmosphere.
7507,"Small, chic airport. Gives a California feel when you enter the terminal. The outdoor waiting area was a very nice addition."
7508,"Great job with the renovation. Bags a bit slow. Good gate agent, forgot a bag and she got it for me."
7510,"LAX Is enjoyable to fly into in the southwest terminal, a few food options and a few gift shops. Tsa was a bit slow (coming from an australian) Overall lax southwest terminal was a good experience for me!"
7511,Sunday mornings had really busy traffic. 20 minutes from getting to the airport to the terminal for drop off. Terminal 6 has excellent amenities.
7512,"As CK status for American, my experience is not typical. However, from the flagship check in, flagship lounge and individualized transportation to the regional gates, LAX is one of the best airports to hold this status with American."
7514,"I was hoping to see a celebrity, but sadly that didn't happen and I wasn't too disappointed because the probability of actually seeing one is astronomically low. This was my first time at LAX and I was actually surprised at the small amount of people there was. Maybe due to the fact that this was in the evening. I don't know. So for this particular flight, not crowded at all and we got our luggage pretty quickly. :)"
7515,TBIT at the time of our flight the best of the LAX terms. Since the airport is under construction transport of any type is a major hassle
7516,arrived with the crew and the aircraft Wunala made her way to the Qantas hanger at the eastern end of the airport
7517,Tom Bradley terminal had a lot of traffic. Good is they have facial recognition which means they do not have to scan boarding passes at all.
7518,I hate Los Angeles the city but on intl flights I can get from my seat to my car in 25 minutes by using the Mobile Passport Control app and parking at the official economy parking with it's frequent buses.
7519,"As a Delta traveler flying through LAX, the new terminal experience looks very nice, but can be very crowded and a lot of walking from check-in to gate. The Sky Club is spacious and grand, and the views and outdoor area are a nice touch, but it's often crowded and out of the way, far from where your gates will actually be. The gate areas themselves are decently well organized, amenities are easily accessible from just about any gate."
7520,"Louisville is an okay airport. It's close to downtown and nearby to famous sites you would likely visit like Churchill to distilleries. Also the airport itself looks nice, but is shorthanded on choices and so forth. I had a morning flight, and I did my research and ate before I went since the only true breakfast choices past security is Starbucks and Chilis. Rest weren't open yet. Also like any Starbucks in an airport, it was painfully packed for those who needed caffeine to survive the day. The shops are fine. There is a whiskey store, but if you fly out Sunday, they can't start selling until 1pm due to blue laws nonsense that should be off the books. I digress, I wasn't planning on getting anything, but they had some good whiskies as a last minute gift idea. Otherwise your stores are basically the news store with snacks and a magazine. I didn't see a full book store at all, or an electronic store. But the news stores to vending machines sold a good selection of headphones. Finally, the seating is outdated. They don't have outlets at all outside of a random wall spot that I was lucky to find at an empty gate that morning, but no luck at a full gate. Wifi worked on my phone, but not on my PC. It refused to be authorized. Overall it's an okay airport. It's clean, lighting is good, and the facilities work. The only huge issue is the wifi for me at least. But the biggest issue is the lack of outlets in 2022. That is a necessity nowadays for work to entertainment. p.s.: TSA precheck was a little slow for some reason. Not a long or crazy line, but it dragged. Especially compared to other airports like O'Hare to EWR."
7521,"Nice, easy airport to get around and fairly good shopping & food for a small airport. Downsides: VERY slow Wi-Fi, and no airline clubs other than a USO club."
7522,Nice for spotting US Army aircrafts are parked
7525,"Really an easy airport, probably one of the easiest to get through that I've been in. It's a small regional so don't expect lounges or anything like that, but there were a couple decent looking places for food and a drink. Just a really pleasantly quiet quick and easy airport!"
7526,"MSN is one of the easiest airports to navigate. Only operates 13 gates with 4 airlines. Gates 1-2 are airport communal used mostly by Delta. Gate 3 is used by Frontier, gates 4-6 operated by United, gates 7-10 are operated by Delta and gate 12-13 operated by American with gate 11 being the third communal gate usable by all airlines. The airport just renovated all of their dining options with mostly being grab-n-go foods that could be of better quality. There is only one sit down restaurant and one wine bar that are post-security. TSA is super efficient and friendly and ticketing for all airlines is in one central area where wait times are minimal to none! Definitely love traveling this airport."
7535,Very fast through this airport. we touched down at 12.01pm and were loading cases into hire car by 12.35! This airport is normally quick to get through immigration etc. but this time I couldn't believe how fast we were through and off on our way
7536,Melbourne has vastly improved during the pandemic with the new renovations rivaling TPA and FLL as one of the nicest airports in Florida.
7538,"Easiest flight out of an airport I have had in years, 30 seconds at security and no obstructions or delays. Bathrooms were very clean as well."
7539,"Not much to see or do here, but the small size makes traveling here a painless experience. Security is almost always fast, and there's no traffic getting in or out. Don't go expecting great transit connections though."
7540,"Nice and simple airport, no crazy turns and routes to get around the airport. But it could use abit more amenities."
7541,"THIS IS A GREAT AIRPORT , NO CROWDS LOTS OF ROOM IN THE TERMINAL AREA NICE PEOPLE , NOT MUCH ON FOOD . BUT NOT ENOUGH FLIGHTS , I T COULD USE MORE FLIGHTS IN AND OUT, THE ONLY PLACE WHERE THE TSA PEOPLE ARFE HAPPY AND SMILE"
7542,Economy parking is now $10 a day.... Surrounding parking lots are also $10. No longer cheaper to park.
7544,It is a good airport for its size there is an okay seating area but that may change with the new concourse b
7545,MEM's new B concourse is way better than I had imagined! I feeling like I am walking around a European airport.
7546,"It is an outdated airport with barely any shops and good inside. However, there is a new terminal being built and it looks very nice but they will not open it even though it is done. Security was easy with TSA precheck but get there early during covid to get your tickets because it is packed around 6am."
7547,Always park at the economy garage for the best rates ($6 / day) and take the covered walkway to the terminal. TSA may question you about why you're bringing camera equipment through for some reason.
7548,"A great airport, easy to get to. The lines were nice and quick, and I was at my flight 30 minutes earlier than I expected."
7549,I actually don't remember anything much about this airport. I was here for a connecting flight (started in Jacksonville FL and was on the way to Las Vegas).
7550,"Easy access to the ticketing and gates. Had a little hard time with a CSR in Memphis with jumpseat agreements. Upon arriving to Memphis, the car rental was a very long walk. Surprised by the long walk (it was also 27 degrees so it wasn't feeling like a casual stroll either). Easy check in and check out."
7553,"Feels fairly dated and cramped, even in the American areas, which is surprising for a hub. The main concourse areas have a little character but off the main drag it's in desperate need of a facelift. That's all the more true if you're not flying American."
7556,"Immigration and baggage claims are annoying when you are transferring on your flight. They have quite strict security and I had to go through the baggage claim and immigration / customs again because of the security, which is not good if you have a transfer flight in less than 1 hour."
7557,"Poor food options in the H/J Concourses, Security line was over 30 minutes at the H checkpoint as they had Regular & TSApre line combined and verified by enterance. By the time it was my tern to enter the regular line, the lady checking the boarding passes (not a TSA employee) stopped us from entering for 5ish minutes when we could have entered"
7558,"Poor food options in the H/J Concourses, Security line was over 30 minutes at the H checkpoint as they had Regular & TSApre line combined and verified by enterance.

7559,"Poor food options in the H/J Concourses, Security line was over 30 minutes at the H checkpoint as they had Regular & TSApre line combined and verified by enterance. By the time it was my tern to enter the regular line, the lady checking the boarding passes (not a TSA employee) stopped us from entering for 5ish minutes when we could have entered"
7560,"Some traffic entering the terminal on a busy travel day, but not nearly as bad as I've experienced in other US airports. Terminal experience was pretty average in the north terminal, though I still believe that MIA has some of the best dining options in the whole country, simply because they have Latin food (and Cafe Versailles). The Amex lounge is quickly becoming too small for its demand in Miami."
7561,"Hi. I am Nicholas, and I am writing this to let you all hear my enjoyment about MIA int’l airport. Getting into the airport, there wasn’t too much traffic for me, because it was a weekday I think. Check in was great, the reason I love the security check is because I saw a cat in there, and I love cats. Terminal facilities were cool, but I don’t know about their Wi-Fi because I used my cellular data. The Starbucks in there was great and I didn’t visit the Lounge, so I don’t know about it either. Overall, it’s a 4/5 for me."
7562,"Relatively quick check-in and security check, but the E terminal is very dated and very cramped, especially for an A380."
7564,"Perfect. Airport is a good size because it used to be a hub, but since it isn't anymore, there is plenty of space and no overcrowding. Fast, efficient, pleasant TSA, etc. All pros, no cons other than I wish the free wifi was a bit faster."
7565,the airport is clean and its location is convenient because it is so close to downtown and wifi was fast and there was plenty of food options
7566,Milwaukee is a clean airport at least in the concourse I flew into. it has got good food options and the layout Is simple
7567,"I may be biased due to me living in Milwaukee, however I find that as frequent as I fly Southwest, I always love flying out of Concourse C. Yes, D might be bigger and do not get me wrong I loved the days when I could fly Southwest out of D post- Midwest, however the Concourse always seems lively, it has a Starbucks, food, and even a kids play area. Security has never taken more than 5 minutes, and I LOVE the retro vibe you get when walking into the check in area."
7568,"Getting in and out of MKE is a breeze, and it features one of my favourite Delta Sky Clubs. With that said, there aren't many dining or retail options after security, on the D Concourse at least. Also, I have had issues in the past with TSA regarding checking oversized items."
7569,i love ur airport i made a fake flight just to say that i like this airport_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
7570,"Not very many food options on terminal D. It's pretty much just one restaurant. The restaurant is good, but there isn't much else. It's Starbucks, that restaurant, or gift shop sandwiches."
7571,"great airport that had public transportation. Great eateries, a wonderful museum, and very nice facilities."
7572,"C19 has destroyed air travel, no one is out. Twelve pax on flight. You can tell that the employees are stressed."
7573,"Checking into flights at small airports is the way to go. Little traffic, small and quick lines to check in, and relatively short TSA checkpoints. Even without pre-check, we were through pretty quickly. Of course the terminal has fewer amenities than ORD or PHX, but it's sufficient. I didn't need not did I check for wifi or lounges."
7576,Very quick TSA check. Very clean and nice bathrooms. Nice restaurants and cafes. Very friendly gate agent. Recommended.
7577,"One of the best laid-out airports in the country with excellent facilities that keep being improved upon. Even this transfer, from Concourse C to G, was straightforward, by taking the back route and avoiding the main concourse. The 3 Delta lounges are excellent, including the brand-new one in Terminal G, which is one of the best in the US."
7578,"Terminal is clean and modern, and security did not take long. Signs are readable and informative. There is no diplomatic line at passport control. When arriving, getting to the light rail station is a bit tedious, but it’s easy to follow the signs."
7579,"this airport is amazing! the security is super nice, Airport is rarely packed but I did have to wait some time for a car rental other than that it's amazing"
7580,"MSP is not a bad airport. Access, parking, and the screening were all pretty easy and quick. Facilities are clean and maintained."
7581,"I personally enjoy being at the Minneapolis Airport! If you have a long layover I suggest you don’t fly Southwest, JetBlue, or Suncountry, because there’s not a lot of food choices, 3 restaurants, Starbucks and a small shop with snacks."
7582,"Terminal 1 at Minneapolis/St Paul is easily one of the best airport experiences in the US. It has plenty of space to get a quite spot to sit, a lot of food options, plenty of shops, including things that are not the standard hudson news and similar stores. it has a book shop, a couple of outdoor clothing stores, even a store devoted to minnesota icon Prince. just all around excellent. I've never been delayed there, but if I had to be I wouldn't complain."
7583,Quite a few restaurants were closed and whatever was open was fairly busy with long lines. American Airlines E gates are almost always cramped due to the airline having multitude of delays.
7584,"Another great experience departing from MSP. The airport was busy, but I had no issues getting through check-in and security in a very timely fashion."
7590,Nice to return to my hometown. Visit to the Monterey Bay Aquarium with my wife and our young daughter was a real treat!
7591,"The convenience factor cannot be overlooked. It's also fun to ground load. The terminal post-security consists of four walls, some seats, and a bathroom."
7592,"Small, regional airport. Very convenient if you are staying in the Monterey / Carmel area. The have streamlined screening for TSA Pre-check, but no specific pre-check line and no priority access line. This is an airport with no jet bridges - you must use stairs to get on and off the plane"
7596,"The location is excellent, right on the beach, and easy to get to. Just not all airlines serve this airport."
7597,Easy airport. Not too big. Good shops and restaurants. Just right. Can get pretty busy at the right times.
7598,"Always a lovely airport. Clean with friendly staff, a good amount of food options and it looks very modern in and outside."
7599,Absolutely love MYR. Perfect amount of accommodations for the size of the airport. Always clean and friendly staff. Easy check in and TSA line.
7600,As my home airport it was pleasant flying home after two months. It’s not too large but it’s big enough. Very modernized at least in the new terminal. Nacho hippo is great make sure to stop by. Staff is always great.
7602,"Really nice, well kept, small airport. Everyone was friendly, even at 11 PM."
7603,"Once the construction activities are done, it'll probably be less annoying to get around. For now infrastructure improvements while important suck when they're being made but greatly appreciate once they're complete. Just, the pricing of the economy parking nearly makes flying out of my closest airport an attractive choice."
7604,"Nashville airport is easy to navigate and TSA lines are well marked. Did not take but 15 minutes or less to get through. Very expensive parking, especially long-term “economy” lots!"
7605,Nashville is a clean airport with friendly staff and I totally recommend it to anyone flying out of Tennessee
7606,Nashville is a clean airport with friendly staff although a 5 star rating may be biased because I had TSA PRE regular security lines looked short For an airport of this growing magnitude
7607,"Very nice but compact South terminal due to construction at the moment, so arrive early, but otherwise very good"
7608,Pretty nice terminal with good facilities and nice staff. I also think the food and retail services within the terminal.
7609,"One of the best airports I’ve been to. Very fast through security, parking was not difficult and the airport is pretty easy to navigate. They are still doing a lot of renovations and a lot of the stores are closed, but it was still a great experience!"
7611,"A lot of choices to wait out your 3-4 hour Southwest Airlines delay! You can find the normal shops and stores, but there are also ""Music City"" themed restaurants like Gibson's and Tootsies! The terminal area is very nice!"
7612,absolutely zero lines
7614,"It's an airport...better than some, worse than others. Food and stores seemed somewhat limited and - at least getting down the A concourse - the walk is super long, with no train or moving walkway to ease things. Luckily we had a lot of time."
7615,"Good airport. Could do with some more spacious lounge areas, and security can get a bit hectic at times. Otherwise decent."
7616,"Nice brightly lit airport. Access roads/ramps are still being built (12/21), so congestion in and around the airport area/Rental car return is very likely. Give yourself at least 1/2 hour to return a rental car and get back to the Terminal."
7619,"Hard to say how I'd rate it here (bearing in mind an entirely new airport is under construction). On one hand there's not much to speak of as far as amenities, places to eat and shop, etc. Just small and basic. Big plus though for the place not being an absolute zoo. Felt pretty relaxed compared to larger airports I've been through."
7622,"Immigration clearance a bit of bind, As with most USA airports, expect to take one hour to clear this small airport."
7623,"I must admit I was pretty disappointed with parts of MSY. Getting to the airport and check in aren't bad. The security check is rather hectic going into Terminal C, and it is very narrow. The terminal facilities feel older than most airports. The wifi barely worked, and the food options in terminal C were extremely disappointing."
7626,"JFK, especially the international terminal, is more chaotic than ever. The SkyClubs are overrun with people, so the new club opening will hopefully add more of a respite in the chaos for Delta travelers."
7627,"Somewhat of a small terminal considering the massive scale of JFK, but considering the size of terminal selection of shops was respectable. JFK itself was quite far away. Security lines was super long but At least there was a shortcut for Business/First passengers."
7628,"Terminal 4. TSA pre check is a must. Security wait times can be 40+ minutes. Lots of shops and restaurants. Depending on your gate, be prepared for a lot walking."
7629,Obviously because I was in Business class I flew through that airport at the speed of a plane at takeoff and I was straight into that lounge
7630,Super quick and it was super fun to see all the big cargo planes and all of that flying over and taxiing and stuff
7631,"The airport was very big and beautiful, the CBP officer that I went to was really nice and welcoming. The people are friendly and the airport is just lovely."
7634,"Check in personnel was very rude. Complained that bag drop was about to close in ten minutes, why did I not come earlier. Turns out the flight was even delayed so I got scolded for nothing"
7635,"Such a great airport all around, especially terminal B. Maple Leaf lounge was great too, although no view of the runway/taxiway."
7636,"After landing, realized I forgot the camera in the plane. Staff was very nice and I got it back in 10 mins."
7637,"Although there was a huge traffic jam on the way to the airport, the airport was sparkling clean and efficient as always."
7638,"The new Terminal C is a significant improvement over the old Delta terminal. This is a spacious terminal with plenty of light from the floor to ceiling windows giving views of the airport runways/aprons and CitiField and Arthur Ashe Stadium. The walk from gate 75 to gate 97 was rather long. Restrooms are plentiful and clean; however, in some locations they could use more stalls given the number of passengers who traverse this terminal. Dining options are placed conveniently but expensive. Lunch for one cost $45. The airport WiFi is free and very fast."
7640,"Our connection in LGA was from Gate 85B to 85A. Although the area in which my gates were located had not been renovated yet, the area was still pretty well maintained and I was impressed by the recently renovated areas as we taxied to/from the gates."
7641,"I am very impressed with the new LaGuardia airport. I believe you can take public transport there as well as a motorway which goes to the airport. The security was very quick, less than 5 minutes. The terminal was new and clean and looked like it had lots of shops. The AA lounge was pretty good, it had lots of healthy food. It was a balcony looking onto the airport so it lost marks there."
7642,Airport has been improved massively since the renovation. Everything is clean and sleek and works as it should be.
7643,"Solid airport. Busy, but it was neat and efficient which is all I ask for. Only departed out of this airport, never arrived."
7644,This airport has come along way in the last three years. Very open and airy and lots of retail and restaurants. Fantastic new United club as well.
7645,The new Terminal A is nice I guess. Very clean. The bathrooms are nice and the restaurant/store selection is alright. The view is also nice and the seats are too!
7646,Just a quick transfer but nobody told us that we have to pick up our checked in bag and move it by ourselves to the united stand at the luggage retrieval
7647,"The new renovations at EWR terminal C, are amazing. While renovations are minor, the new signage, new seating, and attention to detail and United branding is nice, sleek, and more modern!"
7648,"do not try to make it here from nyc at 12 am without knowing what you are doing, too many curveballs for the next 3 hours of your life"
7649,There was an extremely long line in terminal C for UAL departures but I had TSA Pre-Check so it was fine. I had to transfer terminals for rental car service. The bathrooms were clean and there was a sufficient amount of retail located every few gates.
7650,Terminal A looks great. Nice Premier Access check-in but it's hidden until you really look for it. New security is really just pre-check but you have to take the same old stuff off of you. The concourses go in descending order which make no sense.
7651,"The check in process was smooth, and the security was fast and there weren’t any complications. The transfer from the train station using the Air Train was easy, and wasn’t tedious at all. The airport felt a bit old and outdated, but other than that, I had a great experience!"
7653,"Flying out of Newark's Terminal B was interesting, as it is home to low-cost carriers, international carriers, and domestic carriers. The mix is interesting and therefore makes the terminal experience crowded."
7659,"This is a nice medium sized airport.\, with quick security lines and fast checkin. My only complaint is creature comforts. Hours for amenities are limited."
7660,"Always have a great experience at ORF, as my home airport I only really have problems with security check as it always takes a very long time every-time.. Food options are great for a smaller airport. I have never been to a lounge in the airport. Overall 4.5/5"
7661,Only 1 hour of free WiFi and signs for southwest departure drop-off was a little confusing for someone not from here. Still giving 5 stars for amazing and clean terminal atmosphere and stores
7662,"The best part about flying in or out of Norfolk is how easy it is to get in and out of the airport. It is, however, a small airport and so facilities, particularly in the age of COVID, are rather sparse. There are no lounges, WiFi is spotty, the security checkpoints frequently mix TSA Pre-Chek and regular passengers (ORF was one of the last airports to get Pre-Chek) and the check-in experience can range from one star to five, but is usually quite good."
7666,"At one time, OAK was a great airport. Now, terminal 2 (Southwest) is a piece of crap. There used to be a moving sidewalk to help you get to the far gates (e.g. 29-32). They ripped it out to put in more overpriced restaurants. They also have windows facing the ramp frosted so you can't see the planes."
7667,Compact easy to navigate airport. Much easier and quicker than SFO when flying to the Bay Area. My go to airport in the Bay Area.
7669,Easy Airport. Relatively clean/simple to navigate. Currently there is some construction so concessions/food options are a little more limited. Wifi is decent & free. LOVE the Escape lounge. Main complaint is checked bags always seem slow for an airport of this size.
7670,"Fairly small airport, immigration can be slow. But cheaper to fly to than SFO and takes a similar time to get to the airport."
7671,This was my first time at Oakland International Airport. I would always fly from KSJC or KSFO. My first impression of the airport is really good.
7673,I understand food in airports are expensive but the prices here are too pricey. There was no where for me to sit and wait for the flight.
7674,"Recommend 100% for connection to San Francisco. BART is just $10 to Downtown SF and frequent! I can only speak for security check in Terminal 1, but both times I went through it it was quick and efficient - no hassle. For 32 gates, good food options and handy tech vending machines with headphones etc."
7675,"Oakland, the closest major airport to my home, is great due to it's variety of flights while still being a small and manageable airport. The lines for check-in and security aren't nearly as long as nearby airports like SJC and SFO. The terminal is clean, and the gates are more modern in design, however the ticket counters look quite old. Overall a great airport to fly out of. My one qualm is the lack of retail and food choices available in terminal one. Terminal 2 is completely Southwest, so if you're flying any other airline your food choices will be quite limited unless you trek over to terminal 2 after going through security. There are no food or retail options before security in either terminal"
7676,"Oklahoma city airport is a smaller airport with not many restaurants inside. However, the lines are short in security and the gates are all really close to security. There are not alot of shops here."
7677,Nice airport with very friendly staff. Shame International flights do not fly into here as this hub has a lot to offer.
7678,"Arrival---there is free wifi, its under Boingo Hotspot. Bigger terminal that I had thought. Fast baggage claim. Stopped off at the bathrooom on arrival and suitcase was already on the belt by the time I got there. Many taxis waiting right outside. Departure---fast security. Was at the airport 4:30 AM, the few shops were open at that time, restaurants opened around 5 AM. Once again, free wifi, but for some reason couldn't connect to Facebook... worked well on other sites. Wifi connection probably not as secure as it should be. Taxi from Bricktown to the airport and vice versa costs between $30-$40. Had a 6 AM departure and booked the taxi from the hotel the day before which may have increased the price."
7679,Needs free wifi
7680,New fastback security line is good. But why not free wifi?
7681,Security lines are always to long and no free wifi. Otherwise nice and small
7682,"Acceptable airport that has a decent variety of airlines/destinations. Quick to get to and get through, and easy to get upgraded on flights with any degree of status since the flights are not crowded."
7684,"Very nice airport... plenty of taxis outside with fixed fares to the hotels. Baggage came through quickly. Check-in a breeze and probably the nicest TSA folks at security I've ever dealt with. Great free wifi, but once you get through security check, food options are very limited, atleast in the B Concourse where I arrived and departed."
7685,"The best part about flying out of Omaha is never having to be worried about security lines. You can be through check-in and security after 15 minutes max. Dining options are limited post-security, however."
7686,"The best part about flying out of Omaha is never having to be worried about security lines. You can be through check-in and security after 15 minutes max. Dining options are limited post-security, however."
7687,"Waited over a hour to claim baggage,United have outsourced this airport so service is appalling and contractors shouting at each other on the jet bridge."
7689,Terminal 4 is this bizarre mix of operational efficiency with an appalling lack of selection in retail and restaurant options.
7690,ONT is good alternative option for traveling to the LA area. Its small and there isn't much but it gets the job done. The baggage claim area is a bit to small even for an airport which is small to begin with
7693,"Ontario Airport is nice from the perspective of getting to the airport and going through security (though TSA Precheck was closed when I arrived at 6 pm). Terminal 4, though, is pretty lacking in amenities. At 6:30 pm, all of the restaurants weren't even open."
7694,"ONT is one of the world's most generic airports. ONT is good for flying in and out of due to non-existent security lines, but it only has sub-par food offerings, no-name retail stores, and not much else."
7696,Adequate.
7697,Quick and easy check-in process. Short security lines. Ample seating. Poor food selection.
7698,Orlando Airport is kind of busy airport with long lines to Security. The airport is well Maintenace with several food options. Free WIFI and plenty of Disney stores. Long lines to bathrooms are a pain.
7699,"Avis Car rental is a bit confusing. I saw the name GHATAK, A in display board. But there was no additional info. Finally, got a Chrysler Mini Van."
7701,"As ever, MCO's transit links are terrible so I had to book an external shuttle to get there. The security check is abhorrent and shows no signs of improving, there was an almost 40 minute wait. Sun Country uses the same wing of Terminal B as Air Canada which is decent and the food options are good."
7702,Waited over 3 hours for my bags. I had done pre check and the bags still went to customs and back 5 times.
7703,"Wish they’re was more food offerings and TSA would be modernized. I recommend doing the clear reserve which is free of charge and will save you a ton of time at security. I’m so used to the enhanced TSA machines which are new, efficient, and smooth. These are not and I feel it slows down the process. Plus more physical labor is required having to push the bin down to the metal detector lol."
7704,Terminal A where Spirit has their gates is a lot more crowded and congested than the other terminals.
7705,"Check in was mixed, the staff mainly speak Spanish to each other. So they talk about you in front of you, but won't say anything to you. TSA sucks here, first negative TSA experience."
7706,Super smooth facilities upon arrival but arriving internationally from Terminal C is very tiresome as it involved a very long walk to customs and immigration. You collect your bag before you go to the CBP. The system was completely automated.
7707,Orlando airport is super huge and easy to get lost in me and my family have only been there once and it took us forever just to get to the Disney buses so try not to get lost
7708,"Honestly MCO isn’t a bad airport if you have pre-check, but I only give them 4 stars because they don’t have liquid pour-out stations near/at security, so you have to pour your drink in the atrium plants. ????"
7709,"Check in, security- all need big improvements, terrible slovly miving queues everywhere. Staff is extremely slow and little helpful....frankly speaking, didn't expect like that....downgrade from 2022 is significant....."
7710,"When I got there for my return flight, I got there by Lyft to Terminal C. The lounge is good, but I can't say for immigration/baggage claim as I did a domestic flight with a carry-on."
7711,"I think in my honest opinion that this airport is one of the beast airport to fly out of if possible. although it has some issues with wifi and food services, i think this is a great airport!"
7712,"Orlando-Sanford actually surprised me as it used to be really bad, but with renovations and modernization came a better airport. The new tiles floor looks great and the new exhibit is really cool. I wish there was more color to the airport however and that there were more dining options."
7715,"My flight lands and I deboard the airplane at terminal 3 A, when I got off I was expecting to walk directly into the terminal, but I guess that's not the case at Orlando/Sanford, I walked through 7 doors in order to get to the main terminal, I've been to a ton of airports before and I've never had to do this. When I was walking through the airport waiting for the shuttle to pick me up I went to one of the stores to get something to drink, nothing had price tags on it, and when I asked the lady how much something costs she said ""I don't know"", it was $3.75 for a normal bottle of coke, if I got it on the plane it was $2."
7716,"Getting to the airport was easy enough. Long term parking was close and convenient but expensive ($14 per day with no cap). Terminal was pretty crowded. Food options not great, particularly bad upstairs past security. Wifi exists but not functional with crowds present. Will probably fly through here again given it will be only decent option for a specific flight, but would not choose it if other options were available."
7718,"Overall, what this airport lacks in terminal food options and shopping, it makes up for in convenience. I can get from parking my car to my gate in under 10 minutes on a good day. Check in online and save time at the counter, though. Those lines seem really long every time I come through."
7720,"Orlando Sanford features a lounge, with many facilities. Easy to navigate. However, some boarding screens were inaccurate. The friendly staff were able to help us out, though."
7722,"A very very very nice airport, because most of the airport is outside, which is very different. There isn't that much to do after security, and this airport is barely ever too busy, so security is fine."
7724,This was my first time transiting through PSP and was amazed at the airport's layout. The mostly outdoors layout was nice too.
7725,"Great boutique airport! Grass post-security to stretch out on and catch the last few rays of sun; much of the airport is open-air; modern design with updated restaurants and facilities. Small, but nice!"
7728,"An amazing airport for how small and how much traffic it gets, but getting bags checked is very hectic for a small airport, even EWR was faster with even more people! But still is an amazing airport!"
7729,Easy to get rental cars.
7730,Security is slower that ATL
7731,"Not been on a UK to domestic US transfer for a while, really surprised, 20 mins from disembarking I was happily esconced in the Admirals Club!"
7732,"I may be a little bit biased due to Philly airport, but I do believe it is a very nice airport for domestic travel, especially along the East Coast and I hope more international carriers from Europe start flying here."
7733,Smooth airport. No security. You can just walk out. Taxis are available as soon as you walk out. Bridges connect to the terminal’s parking garage to the terminal itself. Nice airport! Great shop and restaurant selection too.
7734,Let's just say you ain't gonna be hungry ever. Philly Airport is jam packed with services and food places. It's not massive and is easy to traverse.
7735,Leave time for connections.. if you come in Top of terminal A its a long walk just to shuttle.. If you have to walk to Terminal 4 its a HIKE not a walk :-)
7737,"If you think you should be there by whenever, be there an half an hour earlier, less people at check in, open space at gates, time to walk around. Just be early"
7738,"Not too crowded. Shuttle took me from one terminal to the other. Security slightly outdated, had to take all laptops/ipads/drones etc. out of bags. Easy entry with Visa (took about 5-10 minutes in total)."
7740,"The Avis Rental Car Facility was so poorly managed. We waited for two hours in the cold sitting night. Watch out for Karen’s though, because they were also a part cause. Two ladies stood there at the desk demanding a Chrysler minivan. They were offered a Honda minivan, the only type they had at the time (9:00 pm), and threw a tantrum like a toddler."
7741,"Small airport, can make for some longer wait times while going through security, but staff are more friendly and parking is drastically easier than somewhere like EWR or JFK."
7746,Clear understaffed and stuck in the middle of the process to upgrade people's profile ... had to go regular TSA-Pre
7747,"Good airport. Everything is centrally located, making access from the concourses simple. Terminal is clean, and the baggage claim didn’t take long at all. Pre clearance was allowed so I didn’t have to go through customs. Lots of clear windows to spot planes from. However I would suggest adding some more seating to the B gates. Some people were sitting on the floor considering how busy it got, when I deplaned."
7748,"Good airport. Everything is centrally located, making access from the concourses simple. Terminal is clean, and the baggage claim didn’t take long at all.

Some people were sitting on the floor considering how busy it got, when I deplaned."
7749,"Very cool airport, with great and modern architecture. Lots of retail and services, such as a museum. Very clean and efficient."
7750,This flight was done during the mask mandate in sky harbor and was a pain to get through the airport and trying to get food was hard as everything was closed.
7751,"For the time I was there, which wasn't that long, it was fine. Check-in and security was fine, but would have been better if we didn't get dropped off at the wrong place. Getting to the airport is really easy, with all the road options in the Phoenix metro area. The terminals had good food options. I remember there being a Starbucks and some bar restaurants in the terminal I was in. There was good enough Wifi and plenty of lounge space. Baggage claim is nice. Overall, a nice airport."
7752,"Was very spacious and clean. Was a bit of a walk from the end of terminal F. Staff were very helpful, and kind"
7753,"Overall very happy with Phoenix Terminal 3. Everything was very fast, food options are good and wifi is free."
7754,It’s good. The only reason I would give it this rating is because there is nothing special about it.
7755,"Sky harbor most days is an easy and quick airport to get through, TSA is always pretty fast and they are actually surprisingly nice. If you're lucky enough to fly through terminal 3, definitely grab some Shake Shack! Make sure you have plenty of time before your flight though as they are often quite busy."
7756,TSA PreCheck today was so slow. I think the one guy manning the belt entry into the x-ray had a crush on the girl reading the x-ray. He kept talking to her and walking to where she was while folks standing in the snail line were waiting on the little baskets to empty pockets. No biggie though.
7757,"Was in a bit of a rush, but great airport to do so. The tram came frequently and there is little distance to cover"
7758,A bit outdated to be honest but very clean and lots of dining/shopping options and friendly staff. Also worth noting you can go airside to shop/dine without a boarding pass via MyPITPass
7759,"Very easy to navigate, easy to get to the car rentals from baggage claim area. Just curious to see how the airport will be when the new terminal is completed."
7760,Big airport with small volume. Old and needs updating. It is also about 22 miles from Pittsburgh and the people that work there are strange.
7761,"Clean with very friendly staff. My only complaint is being from Pittsburgh, most of the airport is somewhat outdated and could use some modernization."
7762,Great airport and will get better once renovations are completed! It is currently however sad to see the airport in almost abandoned state after its glory days!
7763,Pittsburgh international airport is definitely one of my favorites. Has absolutely anything you need and most of the time security is a breeze
7765,"Amazing airport in my mind, all the times I've flown through it security has been a breeze and an efficient ramp team to get the planes out in time!"
7767,"Portland overall currently is a nice airport. As of December 2023, they are remodeling the airport. It takes a while to get to concourse C, but you get to walk through a cool area. There is also plenty of food options in concourse C, and in E. Getting to the airport takes a while from the western Portland metro area. Check-in is normally not busy during the day, and the last time I was there, security was excellent. There is also plenty of lounge space throughout, with a cool little theater in concourse C."
7768,"The airport is easy to reach, and inside the terminal there are nice restaurants and shops. Overall the airport is clean and not too crowded."
7769,"Smooth check-in and entrance thru security. Good wifi and fairly priced food, water fountains are available."
7770,"The Portland Airport is easy to get to and the traffic, while busy is fairly controlled and orderly. I didn't have to wait in security long due to having Precheck, but the regular line seemed to be short and moving smoothly."
7771,"Portland Airport is usually a nice airport to visit from time to time. However, it is frustrating for that one person that needs to go to another terminal as you will need to go through security again! other than that, It is a pretty nice airport to fly into. Probably stressful for people who arrive for the first time. But Hey! At least it's not SeaTac right? I do not normally do anyhting except for stare out the window onto the apron and watch the airport operations. However Wifi is really good. The airport has nice, clean bathrooms as well. If your in Concourse E you do not have many choices for food and if you would like McDonalds, you have to go through security again. So overall, Good airport, bad setup while construction happens."
7772,"Very nice airport with WiFi kindly stretching out to the parking garages. The same parking garages that overlook the runways quite nicely. The Alaska Airlines Express Lounge at PDX was very, very nice! Happy I got to destress there!"
7773,"Doggone good airport, especially as you can get up on the parking garages to do some plane spotting. Very nice."
7775,PDX is an awesome airport! Some major renovations happening now but no problems moving thru the terminal. Can't wait to go back!
7776,"Nice airport, but it's hard to get from the airport to MAX easily. I cringe at trying to wayfind around PDX."
7777,"The airport is so easy compared to say BOS. The largest downside in my option is the lackluster transit connectivity. There is a shuttle bus to the Train/Bus transit hub near Portland and the airport is connected to the Greater Portland bus network so this is more of a critique of the city's transit than the airport. If you're driving, it is very close to the shopping mall in South Portland and Congress Street in downtown Portland"
7778,"This airport was nice, but it did not have very many plugins for charges, which made being in the airport for long difficult."
7779,Awesome new terminal
7781,"Modern, sleek design. Very quick to get out!"
7783,"This airport is a true travel gem and is consistently name among the best small airports in the USA. Conde Nast Traveler readers named it among the top 10 airports in the world. Shops and eateries that were shuttered because of Covid have now reopened. The airport is in the process of adding more amenities and concessions. The newly renovated bathrooms are amazing. They're brightly lit and significant improvement over the pre-existing bathrooms. The sinks have hand dryers built-in, toilet seats that automatically dispense a fresh plastic cover, longer stall doors, and fresh flowers are part of the new look. Security was a breeze. There was no line and I walked right up to the TSA counter and cleared security in less than 5 minutes. The distances from the security area to either end of the terminal are very manageable. The free WiFi is fast and worked flawlessly."
7784,"Fantastic airport, compact and very easy to navigate. Excellent public transport links and plenty of natural light"
7785,Baggage claim said on the plane and the monitors that baggage claim 1. They ended up dropping it on 2 and not telling anyone. But it was a quick fix
7786,A Better option than Boston Logan if you are lucky enough to have a direct flight. Food Options are weak if you have a late flight. Quiet and simple are the real plus.
7787,"A nice, if somewhat small airport. The check-In Area is surprisingly small and cramped, and the airside and gates are a bit on the small side as well. What's more, it is obvious that the airport was only recently refitted for international travel, with limited duty-free shopping available, and the ""international"" gates added in with copious amounts of drywall. Decent Amount of eateries, although their smell seems to permeate the entire terminal."
7788,"Nice airport for it´s size. Big and bright ddeparture hall, only the arrival hall seems a little small from time to time"
7789,"This airport is a great alternative to Logan, and New York. There is a train station soley dedicated to the Airport, one like that of Londons Heathrow. Connects to major hubs like ChigagoMidway and O'Hare, EWR, CLT, and others. Starting up are international services. In the summer, you can fly to Frankfurt non-stop twice a week on Condor airlines. Year round service to Praia, Cape Verde is available on TACV Cabo Verde Airlines. Thesee are both budget airlines, which would be cheaper then flying our of other aiports. They are currently working on expanding their runways and upgrading safety features on the runway,to accommodate coast to coast, and transatlantic flights. This expansion is scheduled to be completed at the end of 2017. T.F Green is in the tall with Aer Lingus, and having flights to Shannon, for both passengers and cargo. They are looking to secure A once again, as they already have; Delta, Southwest, JetBlue, TACV, Condor, U.S. Airways, Cape Air and United. There are small lines, and one gate dedicated to international flights. There is a full service TGIF, as well as 2 dunking donuts. What a great airport to fly out of. It is really getting great upgrades."
7791,"It was a good flight to Seattle, but I would wish that rdu would add one more flight on delta to Seattle so we have options"
7792,"Pretty easy airport to get around. Decently clean, updated, bathrooms were great. Security took a decent bit of time to get through, but kept moving."
7793,"RDU is my home airport. Great facility and friendly people. They are underway on a major expansion now in 2023. Getting in and out will become more tricky soon. Otherwise, RDU is always a pleasant experience."
7794,"My home airport, cannot give it 1,2,3, or 4 ✨. I think it is very good! IDK 'bout the WiFi though."
7795,"It's a rather quiet, clean and new terminal. It's quieter than Charlotte. The AA lounge disappoints because it does not view the aircraft and is quite small. Leaving the airport public transport is unreliable and Uber doesn't work. Lyft took 30ms."
7796,"Really nice and convenient airport. Didn't get any issue with long lines or anything like that. Maybe it was because of the time, but first impression was very good"
7797,RDU is a great airport to fly out of. Terminal 1 is a little bland in terms of things in there like shops and resources. The waiting area by the gate gets full quickly so I advise to get there early. Otherwise everything was great
7798,The RDU team was nice enough to celebrate the inaugural flight as best they could on their limited covid budget and had a few free items and cookies for all the passengers.
7799,The airport moves quickly and with little hassle. The amenities are clean and the dining options delicious.
7800,"Getting to the airport was not much of a challenge at all. Even though it was very early in the morning, everything was still easy to get to. Check in was quick, security was quick and thorough and the line was fairly short. I recommend traveling in the early morning when airport traffic is to a minimum. WiFi was a bit spotty, but overall, RDU is a great place to fly into and out of."
7807,Reno Tahoe is an amazing airport and it was so cool. Security was easy and the food wasn't overpriced at all.
7808,Reno has a great airport. As it is a small airport I expected it to be bad but the airport was great! It was nice and clean and the signage was good. 5 star airport!
7809,"If you don't have pre-check - be prepared for a LONG wait...looked to be well over an hour on Friday, March 12 at 3:00 PM. Fortunately, we had precheck, but I bet a ton of people missed their flights!"
7810,"The Escape Lounge at Reno/Tahoe Airport is outstanding. Nice service, good food, comfortable. It is small but I've not yet experienced it being crowded."
7816,"For us being a smaller city, our facility is absolutely impressive and really well laid-out and easy to navigate. With multiple options and different airlines, getting around here is very simple."
7817,Security check and check-in was fast and efficient. The lines were not long for anything at all. The waiting area for boarding was a bit crowded but nothing bad about the place.
7818,"I like Rochester's airport. For a city the size of Rochester, their airport is actually kind of impressive. It is very nice and clean and I love the silver metal throughout. It just feels sleek. Transit though is an issue. RTS is awful bus service wise. Get a Lyft or Uber instead. Security is odd to me though as they're like a generic knock off of TSA. It's really really weird."
7819,"Security is very fast, and easy. Tye terminal facilities are also very clean. There, however, aren't many food choices."
7820,Fabulous airport. Security is easy and Dunkin Doughnuts line is always short :) Perfect for an early morning flight!
7821,The airport gates through B4 and B22 are just all in one building and it's not very long so it's a pretty nice airport not a long walk to your next gate.
7822,"SMF is a beautiful, clean, and well-functioning airport. It's exactly what you want in a ""smaller"" airport."
7823,Baggage claim took about 1 hour and 20 minutes for bags to get on the belt with no reasons given by United or SMF.
7824,Very spacious airport and you get through very quickly. Easy to navigate although the food was very expensive.
7825,"TSA Pre at this airport isn't the fastest. At least the time I flew out & used it, it took a long time to get thru."
7826,"KSMF/SMF terminal B is a great, updated airport. From my experience early morning security does seem to be more crowded. But after around 10ish it does seem to be extremely quick. The rest of the terminal is great with plenty of food choices. Most seats have power outlets in them, and both ends of the terminal are great for plane spotting. There is wifi that works fine. In my opinion it is a great airport for the semi busy, mostly domestic flights it serves."
7827,"Not too confusing, pretty empty most of the time actually. The check in desk crew is generally pretty nice and fast for what goes on. Sometimes you get the occasional slow boarding, but it doesn't happen often."
7828,I’m biased because it’s tyne airport closest but it has its flaws while there’s no BK in the terminal B there is some options. Seats are good but nothing to praise about.
7829,The rental car shuttle is horrible. It takes forever to get to your rental cars from the airport. The overall airport is clean and they are working on some renovations. Food selection is slim in terminal A. No lounges.
7830,"There's no traditional lounge in this airport. Security check was awful, super long lane compare to such size airport. Wifi is free but speed and signal strength is really bad."
7834,"SLC is a GREAT airport. Easy to get around, fast baggage claim (even with skis), close to the city and mountains."
7836,Absolutely love this airport! The views and how modern it was was amazing! Only issue I had was how long it takes to walk through terminals.
7842,"Long walk between terminals, be advised! It is true walking but there are walkilators to assist with the commute between those two terminals. Not much for lounges."
7843,"The airport was/is still being further developed, but I liked it a lot, especially the ease of transfer in the same terminal."
7845,"The airport is very far from the city,but the installations are very good and comfy.There are many places to go eating and the security check is fast."
7846,Landed here so it was easy to arrive. I hope it's easy to get gere from the city but never been outside.
7847,"We had a diversion into Dallas due to bad weather. When we got to San Antonio, it wasn’t even wet. Really sunny!!!"
7848,"Getting to the airport was really quick and you just park and get inside and it was really quick. Check in had NO line and depending this was the weekend after 4th of July in 2022… it was amazing. Security was also quick and overall everything was good. Once you pass security into the terminal there was a huge crowd getting on a delayed flight which I cannot complain. The o Lu food is Starbucks and they have retail that have snacks but ok. Anyways, a very good airport."
7849,The terminal was terminal B and I have no complaints at all. :) CHECK IN THOUGH IS A WHOLE NOTHER STORY... the lines were so long...
7850,"This was my first time travelling through SAT. Smaller airport with modern amenities. I was happy to see that SAT had both CLEAR & TSA Pre-Check; this made getting through security a breeze. I was disappointed there was no Delta Sky Club, but there seemed to be plenty of food options inside the A Terminal. Overall, SAT is a nice, clean airport that I would not hesitate to fly through again."
7851,"San Antionio airport is small and easy to find your terminal and food. Getting to the airport there’s two spots, drop off and pickup. There’s always a line to pick up people so I would recommend telling the person picking you up to go to the drop off section since there isn’t that many people. Wifi can be slow at sometimes and fast at sometimes. Personally I don’t like airport wifi’s due to their security. There’s ok food choices to choose from and if your in a rush it would be perfect. TSA checkpoint is small and easy, there can be a line and if there is they normally run slow. Baggage claim I can care less there’s only 3 baggage claim convaour belts."
7852,"San Antonio is a really great airport for beginners, it is small so you can't get lost easily. Everything is spread out, very clean airport! Personally I would pick people up from the drop-off because downstairs (pickup) is way too over crowded. TSA has a small little thing but that doesn't defeat them going fast! Wi-fi is alright, sometimes it can be slow and you have a lot of food options to choose from!"
7853,"Sometimes the stores are not open in the afternoon, probably because the rush is usually in the morning. The only StarBucks in Terminal A was closed down and so if you want StarBucks, you have to leave security and go back in to Terminal B. American Airlines Recently bought some gates on Terminal A, they usually fly out of Terminal B. So make sure to check which Terminal you plane is leaving from before you get to the airport."
7854,Security was pretty good I got through in 5 mins. Bathrooms and airport were very clean. Masks were well enforced and the chairs are pretty comfortable at the terminals
7856,"SAN has improved since 1993 when I first started flying in and out of it on a regular basis. It is still catching up to some of the newer or larger airports around the US, but when the new Terminal 1 is completed, it should be on par with those US airports."
7858,"I had about a couple hours between flights when I connected here, so had a chance to wander around the premises a bit -- Sleek, modern facility with plenty of space and ample food options to choose from"
7859,Terminal 1 is old and run down. They are in the process of building a new terminal 1 so hopefully the experience will be better in the future.
7860,"Very easy and simple to navigate, but can get congested with several flights leaving at the same time."
7862,"Very convenient shuttle to Old Town trolley station. Good landside food & retail choices. (Southwest terminal): Not a pleasant place to wait. Surprisingly limited food / retail options, lack of seating, and crowded. Maybe the Alaska Air terminal is better."
7863,"Getting to the airport was easy however depends on time of day and if you are lucky are not when it comes to the Terminal 1 construction. Checked in at home, security was fairly quick and the new terminal 2 is as always a fantastic airport terminal! Got there at the time of boarding so couldn't try out other things so 5 out of 5!"
7864,Decent airport but room for improvement - such as need for better transit. WiFi OK. Security very fast and good. But the restaurant didn't have milkshakes.
7867,"Getting to the airport is quick and convenient. The G gates have a rail station connected to it, so it was quick and easy to get the the airport."
7868,"San Fransisco..... where do I start Arrivals has metal toilets and is bad condition, departures is a bit better. TSA Was quick smallish terminal no big food companies either."
7869,"If you fly with united and intend to planespot, you should hope that you don't get stuck in the back gates where you can't see the runways or anything else."
7871,"It was bad experience that inspite of UA's Hub Airport, check-in counter has many wating people, but only 3 staffs."
7872,"San Francisco International Airport is a great airport to fly out of and into, with modern facilities and all of the essential items an airport must have. Please note, however, that I am heavily biased due to the fact that it is one of my hometown airports."
7873,"San Francisco is a great airport, the security doesn't take too long and after there is plenty of restaurants to eat at, and there is even a museum.It is very easy to find your way around after security. I recommend you bring a jacket because it gets very cold in there."
7874,Qatar Airways check-in was too long due to their carry on policy. Differs from other airlines and typical carry on bags would have to be checked in
7875,"The signage at the airport is a bit confusing, I thought that flying to Canada you would be dropped off at the international terminal but I was wrong. It was quite the walk from the international terminal to the transborder terminal."
7876,United terminal- Nice restaurant with decent selection and not overpriced. Spacious terminal however many USB charging sockets were inoperable
7877,"The baggage claim area can be confusing because the signage isn’t very good. Make sure you walk around the whole area to ensure your find the right carousel. Also, if you come late, the airline might have taken your baggage off the carousel and put it in their baggage claim office. No one tells you this, so you wont know where your bags are until you check."
7878,"The Club SJC at A15 was phenomenal. Truly a club/lounge experience. Hospitable staff, great food, great customer service, and efficiency with service."
7879,"Overall, San Jose is a pretty great airport (and my home airport that I fly from a lot so theres gonna be bias here), but it's Wi-Fi continues to be a disappointment. The baggage claim also took a while to start sending baggage, and there wasn't anywhere to sit while waiting, and the Baggage Claim wasn't quite organized."
7880,"The security check lines were about normal for this time, around 15-30 minutes in line depending on how fast the people in front were. Since I was not traveling with any luggage, and my only carry-on was a small purse, and I had no pockets in my clothing, the whole check-in and security process was very quick. Overall, San Jose is maintaining its fast service, though the Wi-Fi is, as usual, quite unsatisfactory."
7881,"OVerall service at the airport was great. I did land at about 10pm at night, which means there weren't that many places open nearby. The baggage claim had a short wait, but it was pretty fast overall. However, my suitecase did lose a wheel somewhere during the flight. Leaving the airport was pretty cold because the San Jose weather at night is really cold, but the weather in Hawaii is warm. DO: Prepare extra layers of clothing if you are flying this route at night. Be prepared for temperature differences."
7882,AA Ticket counters were on other side of terminal which required taking escalator past security checkpoint and back down
7883,"The terminal facilities run about 3/4 to 1 mile in length, yet the designers of the terminal did not make it wide enough so that moving walkways could be implemented to speed the process of getting from security at gate 25 to in the far flung reaches of the terminal. There is also no direct mass transit link at the airport. You must take a bus to a light rail station, or take a bus to a train station. The shared ride facilities have improved, but it is still a cluster when the airport is busy."
7884,"Super convenient Hertz drop-off procedure and then took the airport bus to Terminal A. All seamless regarding checked bag, boarding pass, TSA, etc."
7886,"Great airport, very clean, modern and spacious. Much easier to use than Oakland or San Francisco and a lot quieter too. Great selection of shops and restaurants and free wifi throughout airport is good. Close to downtown San Jose and an airport I will continue to use in the future now international flights have been added (e.g from London)"
7890,"Good enough for an airport of it’s size. They have good seats, it’s not too busy, and definitely easy to get through."
7891,"Deplaning you are instructed to walk right to baggage claim, but the claim is in a different terminal to your left1"
7892,"John Wayne Airport is personally my favorite airport. It is a small 21 gate airport in the southern suburbs of Los Angles. The airport has is modern and clean with lots of places to eat that are very delicious. It also does not get too crowded making for an easy, fun experience. The airport also has a small area next to gate 21 that is great for plane spotting. All in all, if you fly into or out of John Wayne International Airport, you will love it."
7893,"Very fast and friendly service. Even TSA. No lines at all, not crowded. Good choice for dining. Plenty of seats and perfect location for OC. Love this airport! Would recommend it to everybody. It is one of the best airports I've seen so far."
7894,My home airport. Easy to get going at this airport. Also I love the 'rocket' take off they do too.
7895,Much easier to use than LAX. Actually used surface streets and took only 15 minutes from my sister's apartment!
7897,"Facilities are better than average, clean and well-staffed. It was SNA rush hour but security line was still efficient."
7905,"Nice, small airport. Quick movement through baggage claim, security and terminal in general. Friendly staff throughout"
7906,"Cool little fish tanks and murals of manatees. Very close to Anna Marie Island, and treasure island, not far from Tampa or siesta keys. Pretty tinyn but immediate beach feel, friendly staff."
7907,convenient airport. a little dated but the convenience makes up for it.
7911,Food is good but it's closed all the time. It angers me that the food choices are closed all the time. Good views though.
7912,"SEA is notorious for long TSA lines if you don't have PreCheck, so plan ahead. Delta had just one SkyClub at the time which luckily is large to accommodate everyone, but adding a second will be an improvement. It doesn't feel like a Delta hub in that the Delta area is cramped and outdated; hopefully they invest more in the Delta experience there going forward."
7914,"The Seattle airport is one of the fastest growing airports around the world so of course it was busy, it was easy getting around the airport but I did not like are two hour delay going to Hawaii."
7915,"I normally don’t experience any issues but the only issue is getting through the security check points at certain times of the day especially during the holidays, the Pre Check lines is normally quicker but it has been longer at times."
7917,preaty good airport the only good thing about SEA is it has parking lot for a litle bit of $$$ and a suttle from them
7920,"Old airport, looking like it needs an update. getting around the airport is fine. Baggage claim is very overcrowded, and takes a long time."
7926,Only 10 minutes from my home - easy in and out via taxi or Uber. Excellent Car Rental - no need for a connecting shuttle or bus. Minimal eats but this is not a hub so most folks don't linger.
7927,"I recommend... but only for English speaking travelers. No service for other languages, except for Spanish."
7928,"Beautiful airport, though rent- a- car is very stressful. Also-- Slava Ukraini! Glory to Ukraine! Who's with me?"
7929,Luggage from international flight on Eurowings Discover from FRA was mistakenly brought to domestic belt
7930,Did not need to take devices and food out at TSA pre check and lots of food options! Very clean and bathroom where also clean!
7931,"Amazing Airport, very open, clean and huge check in area. TSA was very kind and quick. Short walk to the gates. But, make sure you know what concourse your gate is in, because it looks like there is different TSA stations for the concourses. WHile you are there, take a look at the Western Global planes parked on the field."
7932,"Almost drove to the airport for a full hour from Marco Island, but regardless everything there was good except theres a burger king at concorce B, and my flight was at concorce D, why does there have to be TSA's at every concorse?"
7933,"Didnt do anything Airside except walk to the baggage claim, the baggage claim conveyors were huge and big. Takes a person enough time to get their baggage."
7934,A wonderful little Airport
7935,Excellent
7936,So we have a lot of trouble finding a place to fill up our water bottles. It's a pretty nice little airport it had this weird toaster plane I don't know why it had that but that was kind of cool to see the toast and the plane.
7938,"Awesome airport and definitely wish more airports were like GEG. Good views of flight ops, Starbucks right next to the gate, and some quiet areas throughout the airport."
7939,"Prety old airport, some of the same shops and layout as the 1980s . . except for the security lines."
7940,Good regional airport. Well it is quite busy. It is and has everything you'd expect from a airport of this size. Food and amenities are good and it is not very busy. Also only one stars on lounges because well... you should know why.
7941,College town. bars close early . The airport is really nice but small. Don't sit near the windows during the afternoon sun. It gets a little intense
7942,"I love departing and arriving out of Spokane. After living in Los Angeles and traveling out of LAX for 20 years, Spokane is a HUGE relief. It’s small, easy to navigate and the people are all very nice. TSA is a breeze and generally the workers are some of the friendliest and easy going anywhere even at 6:00 AM, when I usually fly out for work."
7943,"This is a great small airport! Easy to get to the airport, there is never (or almost never) a ton of people. The crew that works in the airport is really kind."
7945,"Good little airport with decent service by the major airlines to the hubs. Easy to get to and through. Nice facility with room to spread out, a good coffee shop and restaurant. Three stars overall due to somewhat limited airline service. SGF is an alternative airport for travelling to southwest Missouri and northwest Arkansas, and even for northeast OKlahoma and southeast Kansas. It's similar to XNA (Bentonville) in terms of service mainly to hubs, but XNA has more destinations and a bit more frequency. XNA is harder to get to than SGF is, though. Both facilities are about the same in terms of features and amenities."
7946,"I love Springfield's little airport. It's close to where I live, and they make it easy to park and get into the airport. Super nice facilities, friendly staff, and always on time!"
7947,"Nice little airport. Not too busy. Shops and places to grab snacks and food were open at 6:30 AM. Easy check-in, really nice TSA folks at security. Free wifi. The airport only has 10 gates but it felt very spacious with a lot of seats. Took an airport shuttle to and from airport but there were taxis waiting outside the terminal (front door are for passenger pick up/drop off only), for taxis and shuttles, go out the side door marked taxis, buses & shuttles)"
7949,"Bathrooms were a bit dirty and unkept, and in need of repairs. Could use some more food choices as lines get quite long and seats fill up fast."
7950,Food options are fine in terms of variety. A few places to charge devices. Airport overall is a bit out dated. Windows are tinted which can make planes potting a pain.
7952,The majors are in T1 and WN in T2. Both terminals are served by light rail that takes you to Forest Park and the Gateway Arch. There is free WiFi in the terminals. Food and retail close by 1700 on Saturdays.
7953,"From my experiences with KSTL/STL, I can say that the airport is definitely dated. My main complaint is the horrendous baggage claim area. There are 2 baggage carousels for the E? Terminal for the large amount of flights it is extremely crowded. The place is loud as the ceiling is some metal thing that I’m guessing the baggage belt sits on. The roof looks like it will collapse with all the stains, holes and other oddities it has. The rest of the airport is an average airport in my opinion. It isn’t the best for plane spotting as the seats are not facing the windows, therefor the seat backs are against the windows so it isn’t the most comfortable thing to do. Food is average. I just feel that everything needs to be updated."
7954,"St. Louis lambert intl airport is one of the better airports I’ve been to. No lack of amenities, shops and facilities you may need."
7955,"STL is a small airport, which makes it a great place to check-in and start your trip via a connection through a hub."
7956,"I love this airport. It is easy to navigate though the parking lot, and get a parking spot. Getting checked in is easy, and depending on what terminal you are in it is easy to get to your gate. It took me a little while to get through security. Overall it is a great airport."
7962,"Important note, the main runway is closed as of August 17th so your flight will likely take a different flight path over the southern Syracuse area which add about 5 minutes of air time. The main runway should be open around mid-September"
7963,"This airport is truly the best. not too big, not too small. However the dining options are limited"
7964,"SYR is very easy to drive to/from. Located outside Syracuse. Facilities in terminal are basic, eatery is very pricey. Good wifi in general. Airport is near end of major overhaul in main check-in section."
7966,"Tallahassee airport is a very simple airport to get through. The airport staff is nice and willing to help you. Sadly there are no lounges, but there is good WiFi"
7968,"TLH has been remodeling the terminal. For a small airport, has nice retail both before and after security. Does have fre wifi"
7970,"Getting to the airport - Alright just some traffic. Clear navigation to departure drops, arrival etc. Check-in - Americans Self Check In system was easy and helped us check our bags quickly. Security Check - A little congested in airside F (alot faster in other terminals) but it was alright and clear. Terminal Facilities - Bathrooms are clean and terminal is cool as in temperature. WiFi - Fast WiFi and easy to connect to. Food and Retail services - here was a diverse selection of food options and seating before boarding! Lounge - Cannot rate. I never went into it."
7971,"I might be a little biased because this is my home airport, but truly this is a good air port. The biggest downside in my opinion is the lounges, because there's only two. American and delta. The biggest downside is all business and first international travelers are squeezed into this one AA lounge. If you don't care about lounges this is your airport."
7972,tampa is a clean airport and although i only had a 45 minute layover it looked like a very nice airport
7973,"Honestly an amazing airport. Wifi worked great for passing the time, and the terminal seating was surprisingly comfortable. Really good options for shopping and dining, with seating being just the same. Overall amazing."
7974,"Very good looking and had a very nice atmosphere. Shuttle is fun and fast. Very nice air conditioning, which is a must here. Baggage claim took a long time, but it was still good."
7975,It was a very nice airport but I have to rate it 4 stars due to a interaction with a jet blue employee
7976,"Baggage claim was really fast. Customs was fast. I was refused the Lounge, even though I had the status, but the AA People working there are really nice. Overall very good ."
7978,Not allowed to walk from the C Concourse to the baggage claim anymore; Tram was very busy in between all areas.
7980,Very nice airport and very close to city center. Nice large chair to sit on and relax while waiting for your flight. Very quick security lines and check in procedure.
7981,"overall nice, quaint little airport. only has 6 gates and not many flights today, so security process was quick and easy. agents nice and worked with us well. boarding easy as well and gate agent also nice."
7982,"Fantastic airport, small and very quiet. Excellent internet coverage and a local cafeteria with high quality foods. TSA is also very polite and kind in this airport. Overall this is a great airport if you're into peace and quiet, their addition of an outside garden you can visit if you're behind security is also a great plus in my opinion."
7984,"Traveler-friendly Airport. Not too many big, easy to get in and get out. Mexican Customs quick and friendly."
7985,Terminal needs a renovation and food services that take multiple forms of payment. Also less glare in the windows ruining photos of F-16s taking off and landing on training missions.
7986,OK airport but needs more frequent transit and seems in need of a renovation to my WA ST eyes. But that's me.
7987,"Tucson Airport is a little far for those of us without a car. You have to take a car or Lyft/Uber to get there, since the buses are unreliable/infrequent."
7988,"Live music in baggage claim was cool, the American Bag Service Office quickly was able to address my issue (damaged bag). Uber is very hard to find here, the app says ""past bag claim 7"" but when they don't mention is you have to go upstairs to departures to find your Uber, had to pay extra because it took me more than 2 minutes to find the driver."
7989,"Love flying out of TIA, and it's one of the more modern airports in the country. Check-in and security are pretty quick. Food selection is limited, but that's what you'd expect from a regional airport."
7992,It was fine even though I was in there for an hour. If your flying out commercially stay at the airport hotels and you can walk to plane spot!
7993,Nice small airport. No free WiFi though
7997,"Long journey through the airport for PRMs. Efficient assistance service, but poorly coordinated. Polaris lounge very good for their buffets and the drink/bar offer."
7998,Decent. Love the old architecture in the check-in area but the D & C concourses need some improvement from the present box-yness.
7999,"Very nice airport, good facilities and lots of food choices. They even have a chick-fil-a in the international terminal. Most planes leave on time but sometimes their will be delays. Check-in, security, and customs are usually pretty good but it depends when you are at the airport. The airport also has multiple different forms of transportation for the airport to Washington D.C."
8001,"Amazing, staff was funny, check in and security was quick, even at 10 PM with 2 flight crews and an a380 worth of passengers, lounges were abundent, but all were closed. wifi was fast, and there were many stores, but all were closed at 10."
8002,"Washington Dulles (IAD) Airport Review: CHECK IN: We checked in for our United Airlines flight. It was quick and smooth and there wasn't that much of a crowd. SECURITY: The lines were quite long, even at the TSA PreCheck checkpoint. TERMINAL FACILITIES: I found the terminal to be cramped and not enough natural lighting. In addition, it got crowded very easily. WIFI: The WiFi at the airport was not good. FOOD & RETAIL: The food was overpriced and not that great. LOUNGE: The Luftansa Business Lounge was nice, and had plenty of seating and food."
8003,"Everything was quick and smooth, except for the fact that they had only a handful of CBP officers available for several international arrivals. If you are a US or Canadian citizen, it is best to download the MPC App. If you don’t, just be ready to stand in the immigration line for a while."
8004,"Smooth process throughout. Nice check in, nice selection of shops, and the air train is my favorite! Remains one of the best airports in the world for me."
8005,Clean and modern airport. Lots of food and shopping selections. What else do I have to say? It’s Dulles Airport!
8006,"Dulles isn’t great, but at least it’s architecturally stunning. The worst thing about this airport are the People Movers after you land."
8007,"TSA agents in Terminal 1 are rude, unhelpful, and snappy. Terminal is tight and not designed for the traffic it gets. Gate areas are crammed."
8008,"DCA is definitely in need of more lounges; the SkyClub is fine but always seems stretched to capacity. The Centurion Lounge coming soon should help that. Security is always a breeze, especially with TSA PreCheck, but the terminal is often crowded, especially in the Delta corner."
8009,Hadn't flown Reagan in over 15 years and was pleasantly surprised at the renovations. No more bussing out to the plane away from the terminal. Love being able to park outside of the city and ride the train directly to the airport.
8010,"I prefer the E-Lounge (Admiral's Lounge) at DCA, which I consider my home airport. The airport itself it just the right size, so it's very quick and easy to walk between terminals. There are three main terminals that AA uses; C, D, and E and each one have an Admiral's Lounge in it, with E being the newest and my favorite. The staff here are always friendly and helpful, from the AA Lounge to GA and FA, as well as ramp crews and airport staff. Parking in the garage outside, I can be through TSA and in the lounge within 10 mins of parking!"
8011,"DCA is extremely convenient for DC residents -- from being able to take the metro, drive, or bike (if you're light on bags), it is maybe the most convenient airport I've ever used as a resident of any city. Do yourself a favor and take the Metro (save yourself the stress of traffic). The only possible downside is the lack of larger planes/further destinations, but with IAD now on metro, DCA can specialize in its small+short flights"
8012,"This review applies to Terminal 2 only (American Airlines). Transited through a rather busy Reagan National. There are great views for the airfield from the D concourse, terminal building and E concourse. The walk from the end of D concourse to the end of E concourse is rather long and with only a 40 minutes connection, I made it to the connecting gate in E concourse with 10 minutes to spare. Overall, a good airport and terminal to transit through."
8013,"Another great airport I landed at Reagan and it was such a nice area to be in, plenty of food options"
8014,T2 is clean and spacious and has a lot of food options. T1 on the other hand is not so neat and tidy and does not have good food options and it is REALLY CRAMPED. it is also out of date
8015,"Washington national is an airport that I will fly into again if I'm flying American or any other carriers out of t2 because t1 sucks, it is cramped and extremely out of date and you also hav to leave security just to get to t2. food options in t1 are ok but food in t2 is good"
8016,Small airports are always nicer than big airports. Closer to the city so travel is shorter; fewer passengers checking in and going through security; and more efficient boarding.
8017,"The Waterloo Airport is my home airport and I greatly admire it as it strives to bea nice and thoughtfull airport. TSA is fast and efficient, but the airport does feature some deffects. There is only a vending machine and a common room for visiting. The airport does include a student pilot building, and may be able to see a mall plane at the airport. This airport has room to grow and develope as a reg."

8020,"Arived, got to my terminal, and got out of the airport pretty quickly. Note: The baggage claim isn't the best currently. We got there and waited for our bags. There were multiple baggage claim stations that didn't have an airport assigned to them. However, one of them had Chigogo O'hare airport assigned to it (which wasn't our flight). Apparently, the board has been stuck with this status for over 3 days. Our bags were on the belt under the sign that said Chicogo's airport. This caused confusion."
8021,Very nice and clean small airport. Kinda got lost when retiring the rental car but it wasn't terrible. Check-in for JBU was under construction as well as some other parts of the airport. Very nice experience
8022,Wifi was very poor. Worked in only 1 of 3 locations. I'm not sure what else to say. The food options are pretty limited for an airport with so many people flying in and out? It's not a bad airport though.
8023,"The rental car companies are about 5 minutes away, though you may have to wait a while for a shuttle. We rented from Thrifty and had to wait 10-15 minutes for the bus to arrive. The rental car center is somewhat awkward to find."
8025,Nice Airport Beach
8029,"Smaller than AVL, but looked very similar (carpet, chilling crew, etc.). Pickup by Uber was really fast (3 min)."
8030,"Great airport, although quite small with only 8 gates. Only one food option past security, where I got a simple yogurt parfait. No lounges whatsoever."
8032,"This airpot is amazing for arrivals, but for the number of flights they have departing in the morning it just does not have the capacity to handle it properly. Not enough checkin kiosks, not enough TSA lanes, not enough gates, not enough seating areas and a tiny overcrowded concessions store. It is super convenient if you are visiting Westchester. If not for the amazing arrivals experience, I would have given 3 stars based on departure experience."
8033,Baggage claim was very fast and a very quick trip from the gate. Bathrooms were clean and updated. One small complaint is all landside food options were closed at arrival time.
8034,"The best thing about HPN is the easy drive to the airport, especially if someone can drop you off. Check-in is easy, whether you are doing it online or at the kiosk. Security lines are short and fast. The bathrooms are clean, both on the land and airside. There are escalators to the upper levels on landside. Food options on landside are decent with both stands and a full-service bar upstairs however their hours are limited especially if you have an early departure or late arrival. There is a snack shop with good options on airside."
8035,"Getting to the airport/parking: Getting to the airport is quite easy however parking is quite pricey. Check-in: We arrived before the desks opened however, the kiosks were working and we all checked in fine Security: We got there before TSA so had to wait for them to open. However, we were first on line and it took us less than 5 minutes to get through. Facilities: We got to the airport before most of the building was open. The seating in the waiting area and the departure area is a bit worn out but still quite comfortable. Bathrooms throughout the terminal are clean and updated. Wifi: Not offered Food/Retail: For an airport with many early flights, it was surprising they did not open the market on airside until 5 am. The prices however were fairly reasonable and they offered a wide variety. Take note that the restaurant and bar at the airport are not airside. Once you're through security, you'll only have access to the market."
8036,"Parking is expensive, terminal is crowded and small, baggage claim is cramped. But it beats driving all the way to NYC."
8037,HPN was very crowded as always. Very small and only a small food mart post security. TSA was easy and fast. Parking is $30 a day in the garage!
8038,"HPN is a nice airport but is extremely small that does not have many food and beverage options and has a very cramped departure lounge. The location is excellent and the staff is friendly, but it is very cramped especially on a busy day!"
8043,"This is a small airport which I like and has non stop service to Puerto Rico, Which save me a lot of headaches of I would flight out of New York City or Newark airport, hate those airports always crowded and reaaaalllyyy expensive"
8044,"Very easy airport to get around if you're traveling to the Hartford area, or anywhere else in the northeast."
8046,The Escape Lounge in Terminal A was at capacity when I arrived. I had to wait 20 minutes before I was admitted.
8047,To be honest this airport is the perfect medium airport with lots of non stop service and ease of access. On top of that the terminal is very nice and overall it is a great place.
8048,Free wifi is nice and check in is fast. Security is a little slow and food got me sick on my JetBlue flight down to DCA. Bags were quick and bathrooms are nice. getting to the airport was easy by car.
8049,"You have to take GFK for what it is, small. You aren't going to have the luxuries of the major hubs. What it offers is a fast check in, fast security, and a comfortable terminal with wifi."
8050,"Bradley's amenities are ample with a great selection. Several food vendors are McDonalds, Dunkin Donuts, and a take out place. I think there is also a resturaunt past security. All the services are post security. One curious thing about BDL is that the TSA luggage scanners are in the check in area and not underground or behind the counters."
8051,Very nice airport! I loved the rocking chairs in the waiting hall
8052,Free WiFi!
