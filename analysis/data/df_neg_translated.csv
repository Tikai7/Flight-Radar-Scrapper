0,2,Immigration officials looking for bribes. Too many hustlers in the airport. Bathrooms horrible. A bad experience always. Security personnel are professional for the most part. Security area small and crowded.
1,3,"Merger facilities. Terrible bathrooms, dirty most of the time. Floors always wet. Dirty sinks. Aggressive porters. Long lines to check in. Slow immigration officials. Not much good to say about this airport. Crowed waiting areas, no organization getting to aircraft, lots of pushing and shoving."
2,4,"The worst ""¿International Airport?"" I have ever landed in. Three body searches and four passport checks before even reaching the what may be called boarding gate. And a last passport check at the plane door"
3,6,The old international terminal was the ugliest and dirtiest place I have ever been to. The new one seems to be great...for the moment!
4,9,"Lounge was closed without prior notice neither from the airline (Lufthansa), airport, lounge or PriorityPass. Very chaotic and unorganized airport."
5,13,No on-line check-in for BA services so had to use check-in desk. Security was an absolute nightmare with very long queues and fast track suspended because security was so busy – just when you actually need fast track. Lounge very hot and fairly poor selection of food. Boarding by bus only.
6,15,Passengers on the flight to Kyiv were not allowed into the airport with everyone else; they had to stand on the street.
7,16,"The first international airport where you can not pay with credit card, only with cash. If you do not have albanian lek, you can pay usa dollar as well, just charge more. Terrible airport!"
8,22,"Incredibly there is no internal connection between the International and the Domestic Terminal. Moreover the passengers must collect their luggage at international and chack in again at Domestic terminal, after a half kilometer walk olong the street."
9,23,Inbound flight to ALG on a Saturday so road traffic was light. Immigration is so slow. Arrived at the same time as QR - that was an hour gone. Another 45 minutes for luggage. Could do better! I wonder what the departure process will be like?
10,25,"Whoever, may God bless him, will be allowed to go to Shakobistan International Airport.... .................................................. .................................................. .."
11,40,"Smooth check in, need to triage passengers. Business and First Class passengers to be given the necessary treat. Security check staff unfriendly and hold no respect for passengers. Talk to each other and pay no attention if not 100% focus on serving the passengers."
12,41,"Avoid TAAG and Luanda Airport ! such a mess, rude staff, aircraft in such a bad conditions with cabin not doing safety demo and seat are so hard that it feel like it’s wood, and the wall is falling into pieces. I’ve never been scared of flying before and as an Ex cabin crew this is scary to see."
13,42,"Se por um lado o avião estaciona junto ao aeroporto nacional (uma vantagem), por outro fica-se mais de uma hora a espera das bagagens. On one side there was an improvement because the plane is now stopping near the baggage claim area but the time we wait for the baggage for an hour is not admissible"
14,43,"Poor Airport waiting, poor information. No free wifi and if you want to smoke then most to pay for it. Unconfortable and all drinks cost not normal"
15,44,"horrible... toilets are disgusting... Only reason i was here was for work. Staff are rude, refuse to speak English. esspecialy when they have an issue with your yellow fever stamps. Make sure you have this up to date before getting here and clear. took 2 hours to get through customs, could not be bothered to put more people on to help out... all sat in a corner having a chat about us poor folk standing there like sheep for 2 hours"
16,46,"You are lucky if you are not arrested by the angolan immigration at your arrival acused to have a fake visa, just because they don't have their system updated. If at your arrival your name is not in the immigration service system the conclusion for them is obvious: Your visa is fake and for sure you are trying to enter in Angola to still oil and diamonds. Surreal country..."
17,47,"This is without a doubt the worst airport I have ever been to. The service is terrible, customs is corrupt, and so is the rest of the facilities. No good food available, only bad food. Check inn i horrible. Border control is rude, and way to slow. I have no positive things to say about this airport. Even thought it underwent some modification, the toilets still smell like piss. And that is not a good smell in an heated airport. Do not go there unless really needed."
18,52,"I don't think that the airport is particularly suited to handle wide body jets. The additional covid health checks prior to immigration caused a long queue after disembarking on a relatively quiet flight. The Virgin flight from LHR arrived while I was still queuing in the upper level. Who knows how long those passengers had to wait. I did manage to jump a few places in the queue due to not having all of their paperwork ready. Make things easier for yourself and check the entry requirements and listen to the announcements from the cabin crew. Due to the length of time it took to get to baggage reclaim, my case was there waiting for me. There was little open landside at time and due to work going on, the currency exchange was boarded off. There is an efficient taxi dispatch for onward travel."
19,57,"Whoever is running this airport has absolutely no clue, the smart new terminal has shiny new shops and food outlets but you don't get a chance to use them because after checking in they make you stand in a queue for about an hour to have stupid bits of paper stamped (emigration?), so by the time you are done with that fiasco it is time to got straight to the gate. Wake up idiot! your concessionaires should have you fired, they must be losing millions!"
20,58,"Got stuck in ANU departures when BA G-VIIP broke down and couldn't continue to PUJ. Missed lounge access card (MAKE SURE YOU GET LOUNGE ACCESS CARD ON CHECK IN) so couldn't get in lounge even with BA gold card. One cafe with non-enthusiastic staff meant getting food took well over an hour. When I got to the front of the queue they had run out of food so I had to wait even longer. AC was very cold, which for the Caribbean is nice, but we had come straight from London in November and hadn't felt any sunshine yet. We got very cold very quickly and weren't allowed outside just to warm up. All staff bossy and unhelpful. Not a pleasent experience. There is free WiFi though. The lounge is a must; nice small lounge where they keep serving you booze and have limited but tasty food."
21,69,Dirty terminal aucune luggage carrier information drl flight 20 minutes after arrival on a flight 1 hour late I had to find out and the malts were in the search 2
22,75,Longest queues ever. Be ready to spend at least two hours to simply stand in the line to passport control. It's just sad that you first (and last) memories about beautiful Argentina will be so miserable.
23,76,"Domestic departures lounge was extremely crowded. Due to electric storm, many flights got delayed, so the tiny terminal got full of people. There was no space even for sitting in the floor. Options for getting food or coffee are just a couple, really not enough. Security check line was eternal, took almost 90 minutes."
24,77,I traveled with a fibula fracture in my left leg. The service to transfer me from the plane to the terminal took almost 1 hour. A shame.
25,78,"If you are getting a local flight, C terminal is pretty ugly. Only one place where you can get something to eat, and with not a lot of options. The place is not modernized, people stays in the bathroom in order to get a plug for the phone."
26,80,"No meat for burgers at Burger King? This is Argentina where meat is king. getting to the airport was easy enough but since the counters don't open up until 3 hours before departure, it makes it impossible to access the lounges; and the checkin process was slow."
27,81,Terminal C station for domestic flights does not have the capacity to accommodate large numbers of people. It also does not have available and sufficient service areas. It does not have a number of seats and food places.
28,101,Small domestic airport with a lovely view on Lago Argentino. Special Airpot Tax must be payed before the flight.
29,106,"Very small airport where the flights of low cost airlines Flybondi and JetSmart are operated. The concept of low cost airport has been taken to the last consequences here, where food services are non-existent and rely on only one snack machine, seats are lacking for passenger demand, most are standing waiting for their flight and queues in Airline counters are endless. Anyway I didn't have a good impression of this airport when I used it."
30,108,"Pre-boarding area is so small, it only needs two simultaneous departures to become a complete mess, long lines, not enough space for people to line up for boarding, lounge is small too, so try to make a reservation since it might be full."
31,112,"At this airport activity has increase in the last few years, more destinations from there shows it as a good option to enter Argentina from SCL. There are plans for the Mendoza Tram to reach the airport from city in 2014/15."
32,113,Very small for the number of flights it operates. Very abandoned.
33,117,"a very good airport, new and confortable services"
34,121,"Very bad airport. Slow, no efficiency! Long lines for everything, check-in, security screening. One entrance serving as exit as well. Easily THE worst airport we ever flew through. And we've been through a lot of airports in Africa, Asia, Europe, and North and South America!"
35,122,Deorganization toyal delayed flights without presence of airport staff psra organize and report terrible experience
36,127,"An airport that is embarrassing, the lack of infrastructure is alarming. The baggage claim is too small and when a flight arrives with many people, massive crowding occurs. The entrance to the international departure lounge is through a common door and they make you take off your shoes and everything you have on you and they only put 3 chairs (YES THREE) so you can put your shoes back on and all while people are gathering. There is a lack of staff, the stores are always closed, more than an international airport it looks like an aeroclub."
37,128,"Old airport, without infrastructure according to the traffic it currently has. It doesn't have good services. The only positive thing, it is close to the city."
38,129,A very basic and limited airport for a city of one and a half million inhabitants. A shame.
39,146,"A small airport, one terminal for four gates. You can go to and from the airport by taxi or a shuttle service provided by your hotel. The check-in was not too long (but no self check-in available). You can find sandwiches and basic beverages both on landside and airside. Wi-Fi is a nightmare."
40,151,"The options for meals and beverages after the security check are limited at best, with horrendously inflated prices."
41,153,"No announcements in English. WiFi did not Work. Behind the security check no restaurants. One bar was was closed, the other one had only bad quality but expensive snacks."
42,158,"No airports, typically BARACK))) bad people, evil, unresponsive, the food is not good overdue NOT ADVISE !!!(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((( Terrible!!! .............................................................................................."
43,159,"In fact, 26b swapped with the guys at the aisle"
44,160,I was billed $50 for liquor I purchased in the duty free shop. There is a 1L maximum for liquor per adult. You will be charged $20 a bottle by customs if you are over 1L
45,161,Terrible!! 40 minutes after landing waiting for a gate. While flights which arrived later got a gate first. Terrible long lines. Worst experience at an airport!
46,162,"Very chaotic boarding proces. Pax had to go via an emergency door to go to the apron. Our already delayed flight had to wait for a Jet Blue flight to board to keep them on time, while the most pax on my flight had connecting flights at Houston,’and missed them. Strange policy. Very very annoying intercom at the gate that started to transmit announcements for other gates and after two seconds was cutted off. And why do people have to SHOUT through that mic?"
47,163,This airport utterly failed in handling today's crowds. 90 minutes total in security lines before reaching my gate - worst ever in the Caribbean.
48,176,Adelaide airport built without regard for including toilets. What toilets there are at the extreme ends of the terminal and one set in the middle.
49,183,Fabulous airport. Would fly to/from here again in a heartbeat. Brand new terminal with comfortable furniture throughout and nice interiors. Good cafe and friendly staff everywhere . Would be nice if a premium lounge was opened up though a fab airport
50,193,Extremly long waiting time for luggage (50 minutes). Strange taking into account there was one plane only
51,194,"Ice Tea costs $9.50!!! At least $5.00 for a drink!! Uncomfortable, crowded terminal. Not much that you can do about it though, only way to get in and out of Ayers Rock."
52,198,"nothing much happen here, a few small flights, and helicompters for the tourists too see kings canyon and ayers rock"
53,203,"A mediocre regional airport that really feels like it's been done on the cheap. Needs a bigger departure lounge, as it has serious issues coping when Jetstar or Virgin fly in. Acceptable for its purposes."
54,206,Airport line is long and bad and takes for ever to get through unless you do the machine check in before going through customs
55,212,Arriving late we found that the first exit to baggage claim was closed and an alarm sounded that was so loud i'm sure it would be illegal. This meant walking to the exit at the Qantas end then all the way back to the Virgin carousel. I only have a bung knee but felt sorry for the much more elderly
56,216,Very small airport and can get overcrowded easily if large aircraft e.g B738 or A320 arrive or depart. Amenities are limited in the departures area. Only one arrivals belt and takes so long to get your belongings after arrival. The airport is also very hot but it is quite well ventilated.
57,220,So the baggage carousel isn't air conditioned... a rather unpleasant arrival into BME! Baggage services doesn't exist... any problems you need to run around to departures.
58,221,"Third world country airport, just like Perth. If you arrive 2 hours early you have to wait outside as the airport remains closed until just before boarding time. No access to a cafe or shop or anything. No check in. Then you are through and find the Qantas Club locked until 30 minutes before boarding, which makes this much trumpeted about facility utterely useless. What a hole Broome airport is."
59,222,No under cover departure from plane walk down the steps out into the tarmac heat or rain to the terminal. When you get there no seats no refreshments just stand and wait for the baggage. .one point in its favour it's close to town centre. Lots of character if you like 1960's
60,223,"The flight delayed by over an hour. it arrived late and and left late. The airport facilities are simple. It should not be classes as ""International Airport"". Wifi only works intermittently and only allows e-mail, web browsing is almost impossible."
61,224,"After Perth, Broome must be the most horrible airport in this world and I have seen about 200. If you arrive a bit early for your flight, the terminal is closed with a gate and you sit around on wooden banks, if there is still one left, opposite the empty checkin counters. To get a coffee you need to take a taxi back to town. It is a so-called international airport, but no international flight is going from there anymore. Spent some horrible time waiting there with many other passengers who had hoped to buy some water in the heat but ended up drink tap water bin the toilets as there is nothing on site. Traveller beware !"
62,250,"Only stopped during transit, on the last flight out of Canberra for the night. Terminal is compact to say the least for international flights with not enough seating for a full plane load, let alone a number of international flights."
63,251,After bad weather took ground crew an hour to load our aircraft even though we were first scheduled to depart
64,261,International transfer area had no facilites whatsoever. Extremely boring place to spend the night.
65,262,This is a provincial airport that likes to think its better. However it is plagued by slow international arrival clearing of immigration and luggage. Also most international flights depart and arrive in the middle of the night making it an inconvenient place to start stop or transit
66,266,"Arriving in Darwin was hot and humid, and the tiny duty free store which was open for a few minutes while the passengers disembarked was very limited in range. The only cafe in the domestic terminal while waiting for our connection was hugely busy and it"
67,278,"Excessively busy, terminal way too small, security line was halfway down the terminal, boarding gates were jammed full of people, no aerobridges, toilets too small. Airport bus apparently on a 15 min frequency but actually running on a non-advertised reduced covid timetable of one per hour."
68,291,no airbridges. not even a covered walkway along the front of the terminal building. bleak and windswept. inadequate cover everywhere.
69,293,"miserable facilities. no tarmac cover whatsoever once you leave the terminal in the sleet, sun, rain and wind."
70,299,Walk over tarmac instead of aero-bridge
71,330,"Qantas business lounge full, lots of noisy infants, person sleeping on one of the settees. Went and used the adjacent AMEX lounge, 1000% better."
72,339,Didn't go there. just stoped to refuel then back to melton mini
73,357,"Security were rude - instead of asking me politely to go through the scanner some ape just grabbed my arm and physically pulled me. A smallish airport, so not many facilities, and I’m really not interested in duty free or shopping. This was in 2014, much improved following this first visit."
74,366,"not very many options to choose from, terminal is small and can be crowded when multiple flights are arriving and departing in short timeframes"
75,367,"Jetstar Gate Agents are rude and unhelpful, Check-in is as easy as normal, Security Point is all over the shop with it not being properly set up. Overpriced Food, Minimum Restaurants, Overcrowded Lounge and waiting area, not enough seats at (hopefully) temporary gates, Wi-Fi is a pain, Bathrooms are lacking any cleanliness, I hope to fly in again once it's finished its upgrade, the viewing area is blocked by Gates 1/2."
76,374,"Embarrassed to have this as our arrival airport for most international visitors. Transport is appalling, staff are rude and unprofessional, it’s difficult to find any information on services like hotel transfers etc, getting between domestic and international is a pain, and you can’t even check a bag in for a next day domestic flight after arriving on an evening international flight because “the airport closes overnight”. Don’t know why that means they couldn’t hold on to a damn bag for that time…"
77,387,Townsville Airport is way overdue a world class upgrade. The lounge is a hazard to try and walk thru to the toilets. Townsville Airport is an embarrassment to all travellers that have to use the poorly planned and run airport
78,388,"Loved it, nice to see F18's when we landed there, it's cool!!!"
79,399,"Much weather delayed flight held on apron for stand and then a wait for bus to take 30m to terminal. Cramped customs and worse baggage reclaim, not suitable for number of passengers coming in. Departures and external the same. Stunning approach though."
80,404,B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L!!!!
81,410,Had to stand in bitter cold queuing up to get into the arrivals section. Only one immigration officer on duty to check passports.
82,412,Small airport. Ideal if flight is on time but limited facilities to cope with delays. LT car park expensive.
83,416,"Fast processing, friendly staff, wide range of options - nice airport"
84,418,"Very small airport, seems very deserted, staff in the cafe unfriendly, no possibility to buy cigarettes."
85,421,"Deplaning in small groups due to local restrictions but then the whole plane getting packed into one bus. So stupid... We were waiting long to get our COVID-documents checked. There was a big crowd waiting in the queues without distances. At same time flight of Turkish Airlines arrived. So many people not wearing their masks, but no one cares. Silly silly"
86,424,"Airport is completely out of its depth dealing with ski flights during the season. Place is manic with no space, organisation or coordination. Will try to avoid airport in future."
87,429,Lousy airport. Thight crammed check in area with long ques. Very long security lines. Took almost an hour to get through. Poor food and retail services in a small and crowded departure area. It also has bus gates.
88,430,International Airport closed after 10pm. Everything is closed in the evenig and only limited train service to the city. Cheap Airport
89,431,"The airport is pretty basic. The duty free is just alcohol and perfumes. And the lounge was closed, the other lounge was overcrowded"
90,432,There is no proper queue for security check and people are crowded. Ground staffs has no clue how to manage the crowd and their wrong decisions make things worse. Took around 30 minutes to cross the security check.
91,433,"Terminal 1 is quite far from the airports trains station. Check-in desk opened awfully late, resulting in huge bagdrop queues. Vienna lounge is ok."
92,434,"When transferring from Shanghai to Berlin, you unexpectedly had to go through security again."
93,436,Absolute mismanagement of the crowd during security check. No wonder this is the country where Hitler is from
94,441,"Weak transfer experience. Rude imigration officers, misleading info in transfer desk, rude security. I will not transfer in Baku again!"
95,442,"Transfer desk employees gave bad informations: 1. That Ii need paper boarding pass to enter LH flight (not true) 2. I will not enter lounge with electronic boarding pass ( also not true) So made me to wait in transit zone till 3 hrs before flight, then took my passport and went to public zone to checkin to print boarding passes. Weak transfer experience. Than when sitting on bench in transit zone some imigration officer came and said I cannot sit here. Asked why? Because thay see me in CCTV.. what a rude behavouir. Never ever transit ib Baku, new building.. but personel stayed in comunism."
96,448,Why crew of International airport in Baku cant communicate with passengers in english??? Its ridiculous...
97,452,"Do not allow people outside the airport grab your luggage to help you put it inside, they will ask for a tip of $10.00. Becareful and do it yourself."
98,455,Wifi was horrible in terms of connection and backend software. Hard to find a power outlet No tables
99,456,Back in the 70th we wer welcomed by a steel band right at the airplane at the apron.
100,458,They were renovating the US departures area but the rest of the airport was indeed horrible. Then again infrastructure is not that fantastic in Nassau anyways.
101,459,"Like a shed, it was horrible!"
102,466,"Tables in pearl lounge filthy. Definitely not covid friendly. Check in staff unhelpful and rude - declared multiple times that I had the wrong visa despite it being stamped in my passport. Immigration staff even ruder - ‘your passport is too full, you need to keep it cleaner’ when he couldn’t find my entry stamp. Security staff watched me remove laptop and electronics, then told me no need and to repack immediately. They’d watched me take a few minutes to do this and didn’t think to stop me. Would not fly back via here again through choice. Both arrival and departure experiences unnecessarily stressful with rude staff."
103,467,"Clean airport, but poorly signposted for taxis ans rude immigration staff - he said card payment was fine, but did not tell me debit card would not work for visa payment. When he tried it twice he very loudly announced that ‘I had no money’. When I used a different card he then told me that debit card wouldn’t work and only credit card, but only after both embarrassing me and making me stress that my card was not working. Not acceptable."
104,469,"Chaos; airplane ready for boarding, people waiting in a queue in front of a gate, just the boarding staff missing..."
105,472,dhaka is porbably the worst airport ive ever been to its dirty baggage waits are long the airport is just outadated especally for how good of a flag carrier bd has
106,473,Crowded very crowded from outside and inside car took like 30 minutes to even enter the airport large group of military personnel which I assume were coming from training idk I really liked looking at the q400s and atrs although my flight was delayed almost an hour for some reason food I got some pizza thing was kinda bad slice was like 2 inches thick
107,476,"A absolutely horrible airport, from arrival till departure, a nightmare to use. Outdated and so overcrowded with literally no service at all.. arrive here at least 4 hours before departure for international flights. Hope the new airport will open soon. Bangladesh deserves a better airport!"
108,479,"The visa on arrival (VOA) process is a shambles. You have to queue to get a form, complete that and then queue to pay the VOA fee, which must be in foreign currency equivalent to USD51 and then queue present all these forms to immigration. This took over 1 hour."
109,484,"Help this airport. Unfriendly staff at security, complex process for Transit passengers. We were traveling GND-BGI-FRA, thus transit in Barbados. Leaving plane, got a paper that we’re transit passengers. After we must enter a hall and do security inspection, we just did in GND. One security belt, three unfriendly people for around 100 passengers. We were one of first but it took ages per person. After security we were in departure hall at gate waiting to enter our plane again which got delayed cause last transit passengers were still in security to transit. Unbelievable!"

111,486,"It is a poor Airport-Experience for an ""International"" Airport. Dirty, to find the Gates is confusing."
112,496,"Small airport and very slow Passport/border control officers. They always find something to complain about upon entering Minsk, they are rude and very slow. Worst airport i ever been to."
113,500,The security check was so slow that I forgot I had been told to take out my laptop!!! Nobody warned me when I left without it. I only realized when I was about to take the bus to the plane. Kudos to the staff who helped me get it back and of course to Belavia for waiting and sending an extra bus for me (wouldn't it be more efficient to have the business class minibus wait for me?)
114,501,"Not recommended for transfer. For some, unknown and ununderstandable reason, passengers have to wait on an empty transit counter in a uncosy and warm hall after leaving a plane. After 20 Minutes, a single staff had to look at passports and bording passes to be let to the connecting flights gate. Avoid Minsk Airport at all costs!"
115,507,"Well, it's a really small airport with bad connections to the city... Atleast the customs were fast and friendly, also the walking from my plane (ATR72) to the terminal was kinda nice, ah well, that's because I was surrounded by maybe 5 fokker 50's! XD But, from what I saw, it's just another small airport, nothing special."
116,508,This is a great little airport and if you have the time they have a super aircraft museum right next door.
117,510,Encountered a very rude immigration agent due to my UK passport. The routing for UK passport holders is very confusing and not clear when connecting through this airport
118,512,AWFUL immigrations/customs process. NEVER EVER will I transfer through Brussels. I’ve never seen so many passengers miss their flights due to their inability to process in an organized and timely manner.
119,518,"Most things are good, but I don't like it at all, why? I WAITED FOR 4 HOURS DURING PASSPORT AND CHECK, WHAT IS THIS?"
120,519,The only one airport I was with toilets for money only... It is kind a joke... really bad experience!
121,522,The price of the official car parks has been raised again this month (July 2023). Where I used to pay 27 € I now have to pay 35 € : a 25 % raise !
122,523,Even toilettes (upon arrival) are paid! Despite each passenger pays airport fees within the ticket price. outrageous
123,524,"Very unsexy Airport. Chaotig facilities and parking situation. Food court available but extremely narrow and crowded. Much to less seats at the gates. Leaving the flight within rain is a mess, complete foodway hasnt a roof. Signs for parking quite rare. Even if booked a parking f.e. at P2 you have to circle and circle to find a parking lot or wait until someone leaves. Trashy."
124,525,"A bus stop in the middle of nowhere has more to offer than this excuse of an airport. I guess there must be worse, but for a European airport, this is scraping the bottom."
125,530,"nice airport , nice planes ! :)"
126,531,"Nice airport , nice planes"
127,536,Great airport!
128,544,"Hopefully, the new terminal is going to provide better service after it opens in 2020. You can expect a lot of waiting at the current one for immigration, as only a couple of the kiosks are staffed by the Immigration & Border Control."
129,545,"Hopefully, the new terminal is going to provide better service after it opens in 2020. You can expect a lot of waiting at the current one for immigration, as only a couple of the kiosks are staffed by the Immigration & Border Control."
130,556,"This airport is at 4,061 meters of altitude of the sea level, perhaps this and a huge photo of the Bolivian president Evo Morales in the landing sector are what draws attention in this airport."
131,559,Overpriced with little to offer for a nations capital airport.
132,564,"VVI is the major international airport in Bolivia and has all that is required to function as suc, yet much is left for it to be a desirable connecting airport hub."
133,571,"As long as there are no foreigners coming to Mostar, it will be fine! :D"
134,572,"This is an airport void of facilities. The only option for food is a small café with overpriced dry sandwiches and tiny bottles of drinks. There are practically no sockets for charging your cellphone etc., and the available WiFi is terribly slow. If there is more than one or two flights leaving at the same time, the number of seats available is also insufficient. The only public transportation from the airport is a bus that only leaves about every two hours. The taxi drivers refuse to use the taximeter, and charge outrageous prices for the short trip into town."
135,575,"The worst airport I've ever seen. No direct bus/tram to the city center. Free wifi for 15 minutes, no water in only one duty-free shop (!), security control is a joke. Even the main clock says wrong time..."
136,580,WORST AIRPORT IN EUROPE...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
137,582,I don't know if it can get any worse. I understand that you have to expand and that it can create problems but that employees are so melancholy and almost angry cannot be explained. Improvement is needed on all points
138,583,the good thing about tuzla airport is that there is an airport...nothing else... catastrophical apocalyptical place...
139,584,I had to wait 30 minutes outside under the rain because of the slow passport control. But the worst is that the flight from Sweden that landed only a few minutes after us had to wait until we have finished with the passport control to leave the plane. My flight from Vienna to Tuzla took 40 minutes but passport control took my about 55 minutes at Tuzla airport itself! This is getting worst from year to year...
140,585,"Airport is being renovated but as the works are being done, it is now overcrowded and it is desastruous! I hope that the new terminal will be better."
141,587,"Very small airport. Wizz Air is the only operating airline here. There are plenty car rental desks, and shuttle services. Only 2 check-in desks operating, but they handle 1-2 flight at a time only as well. There is a bar upstairs, with view to the apron. They serve food, drinks and coffee :) No Wi-Fi. Very friendly, welcoming staff. Passport controll is only 2 desks, and terribly slow. Welcome to BH :)"
142,593,"Ridiculous small airport! To give you an idea, the rental company has a counter with just 1 employee who does everything, swipes your card, you wait at the front, another employee comes with your car. On the way back, stop at the door and call the counter and the employee will come and take the car back..."
143,596,"Airport undergoing renovations, on this day it rained heavily"
144,600,Aircraft stopped outside the terminal. There was only 1 bus available which had to make several trips to transport all the passengers. Lack of planning and organization
145,602,Very bad experience with delays at immigration and customs and extreme delays in baggage delivery.

149,607,"Upon arrival in Belém, coming from an international flight, you notice the delay in immigration. Other points add up negatively in BEL today, food options, bathrooms, transport to the city."
150,608,"Belém Airport needs to improve a lot in terms of customer service. When boarding the flight from Paramaribo, there weren't many food options available, it was hot at the airport, and it took a long time at security."
151,635,"Terrible. Delays for off board, travel to the airport and even departing again. More than an hour of waiting."
152,637,Really slow service for connections. Our flight was delayed around 40m because of poor taxi service.
153,647,Small local airport. Very old building. Not much more to say about it. New terminal currently being built.

164,677,"Very small airport, after going through the x-ray there are not many options for places to eat. We almost missed the flight."
165,693,"This airport urgently needs to undergo expansion. It is undersized, has no fingers and the entire structure is precarious."

As bad weather is not unusual in Joinville, 20% of the flights in the morning get cancelled or redirected to Curitiba, which entitles you to an additional travel time of 5h (2h organizing, 3h bus ride to Joinville). Seems to have no landing aid or ILS... Road to the airport looks like a minefield."

There are no jetways, no air conditioning inside the passenger terminal, the cleanness is terrible. Only one small baggage claim area. The boarding room is, for sure, the worst in my opinion. Only 3 gates, and there’s no plenty of space to accommodate the passengers inside. Only one Xray machine working, which makes the queue huge for the boarding process."

204,888,"Unfortunately Congonhas airport is at its limits. Bad traffic to get to and from the airport; Departure lounges without space and comfort for passengers; WiFi impossible to use; Food in the departure / arrival hall with very high prices and low quality; Boarding gate is changed several times. It happened to me, the gate initially announced to be 12 (main departure hall), and it was changed to gate 20 (for remote boarding on the lower floor) If your flight arrives or departs from Congonhas, be patient and prepared."

206,897,"Bathrooms in terrible condition, I even experienced embarrassment, where a cleaning person practically broke down the door thinking it was locked, but I was doing my business.

207,898,Transferred through GRU from a flight from EXE to YYZ. Had to de-plane and re-do a security check which makes no sense. Crowded terminal with poor layout with large walls in the middle of the terminal making the other areas crowded.

210,922,Aeroporto não conta com pontes de conexão com aeronaves. Todos os embarques são remotos e feitos dentro da apertada sala de embarque. Em dias de chuva com atrasos é comum a sala de embarque tornar-se desconfortável já que normalmente não comporta o número de voos nos horários de pico. Apesar do calor tradicional de Vitória o salão de check-in não conta com ar condicionado e o calor pode ser perto do insuportável. O aeroporto conta apenas com algumas lanchonetes e não oferece opções recomendáveis de alimentação. O aeroporto já não apresenta estrutura para o tamanho da operação. Continua sobre administração da Infraero e fora dos editais de privatização. Existe um plano de construção de um novo e moderno terminal mas sem data de conclusão prevista.
211,924,Difícil...!
212,925,"Precisa de reforma urgente, necessidade de reforma da area publica do aeroporto com melhores facilidades aos passageiros"
213,927,Getting better with time but the lay overs can be very long & there is not much to do. It does help when flying Business as you have access to the business class lounge. Other than that there is not a lot to see. The good thing is you can go outside & see the planes arrive & take off. It’s very Hot & very Smokey. It is the smokers cage after all.
214,941,My flight was cancelled and next flight was delayed but the staff at the airport did not give any information about what was going on. They were completely incompetent and this should not happen at the international airport.
215,942,Badly managed airport. They had 8 flights on that day and their managers decided to make 4 of them at the same time.So when you land prepare yourself to wait at least 20-30 mins to clear the immigration.Also their duty free is not duty free as most of the items are 2 times more expensive from every normal high street shop.
216,943,"This airport is shame for Fraport. Only junk food restaurant's,the air conditioner been turned off and the on that day was only 4-5 flights but the security check's takes ages as their staff is unexperienced."
217,945,JThis airport in 1991 was the worst airport imaginable. Food and drink was very scarce. The airport was filthy and I was grabbed by security and taken into a room to be searched. I was manhandled and treated like a criminal. I had nothing I was not supposed to have. The whole experience was a nightmare. I guess things have relaxed nowadays with Communism long gone. But at the time it had only just ended.
218,946,"Don't have ATM, Dont work any shop, don't have fud Court, .... If you coming in this airport take with you Food and water."
219,948,"No public transport to the airport at all, only taxi. No wifi, one cafe that had sold out of food. Not a very good experience here."
220,951,Terrible facilities. However take note this was 2006 so things may (hopefully) have improved here!
221,961,Very poor lounge. Only cold side dishes. No fast track on security control. No fast track on boarding. Business class paxes must wait in queue with all of People.
222,962,IT WAS SAD TO BE IN ALL THE AIR PORT EVERONE IS POOR AND ASK FOR MONEY IN 2017 AND THE TERMINAL IS NOT GOOD AT ALL
223,968,"terrible service: long-awaited ramp to the plane, then the apron waiting for a bus, three officers at passport control and at the same time, still had to wait for luggage and a pram longer. Airport service to send to the client-course! ужасный сервис: долго ждали трап к самолету, потом ждали перронный автобус, три сотрудника на паспортном контроле, и при этом, еще пришлось ждать багаж, а детскую коляску еще дольше. службы аэропорта отправить на курсы клиентоориентированности!"
224,969,appalling service: ruthless examination to be asleep in the stroller infants and baby food in hand luggage; confusion at the gate; not enough seats in the styryl zone; Paid baggage carts. Airport staff aggressively tuned - this was not even on the inspection to Dubai
225,981,"I had to get an entry Visa on site, which i knew about. The currency bills you get out of the ATM are quite large, so it was hard to get change to pay for the visa. Also, the customs agent bribed me. My passport pages were quite full, so he was going to send me back to Singapore on site... but instead accepted tip money and placed the visa in my passport. I was so shocked and uneasy that I'd be turned away and was just trying to do the right thing (and also stay)."
226,982,"Was full on mosquitos: hundred of them biting everyone, everywhere in the airport, even on the plane. Worst experience waiting in an airport, even if the rest was ok."
227,1018,We were the last flight in and got parked at the furthest gate. Plenty of empty gates that we walked right past... Then the bags took over an hour to come out. Not cool.
228,1042,"This airport is an embarrassment. It looks like it was an old hangar they tried to convert. It’s awful. Wouldn’t use again in any winter month, you walk outside from terminal to plane and back when you return."
229,1051,Not a big airport but weird boarding gates. Doesn't matter which gate plane is on. The counter can be down the hall. 2 flights boarding and crossing in the hallway. Strange Taps didn't work in washroom. Pretty dirty floor.
230,1052,"The oversized luggage area is ridiculous. For an airport in this area they should expect lots of skis, but here they have a small area in the corner where dozens of people have to crows around trying to get their skis. Poor planning!"
231,1061,Security personal the rudest I've ever witnessed. Insulted me. They think they stand above the passengers. Record the interaction when your luggage is being checked.
232,1065,"The airport security is prolonged, I highly recommend getting to the airport 2 hours before your flight to ensure that you make it, especially for international transfers which do not happen frequently and they cannot rebook your flight."
233,1081,"I rarely fly through Ottawa Airport. When you leave on a later flight, most everything has closed up. There is little before security and when you get past security, there is more, but for a 24 hour airport, there is little open."
234,1082,"Terrible experience for trans-border, in the US pre-clearance area. While the domestic / international terminal is great, there are no lounges and very limited selections in the transborder area... especially if you're delayed."
235,1092,Delay due to Ice fog... Original Dep time should have been 0930
236,1105,"Awful airport that is too small for all of porters flights and connections. no where to eat, no where to sit, just pitiful."
237,1114,Love this airport. Wish they could fly jets out of here
238,1116,"Sorry used to be one of my faves but escalators were not working, flight was not posted to the FIDS for baggage claim, and ride-app area was a chaotic mess on Ground level of T1."
239,1141,"Go fly in a float plane , my one and so far only float plane flight thanks to Harbour Air , unforgettable . The city and island are worth the ferry trip too ."
240,1165,Tiny airport for the area it serves
241,1169,"Very nice design. Slow check-in, only one security checkpoint available for passengers for 4 flights...One international gate without further info (Ok, I cannot count shouting lady from local handling company :D) And don´t forger local slogan: No Stress! :-)"
242,1172,"Extremely slow staff. There was only one plane on whole airport and we waited almost 2 hours for check-in, safety control and boarder check. Never more."
243,1176,Nice basic airport :D
244,1177,"5x 737 was nothing, every Wednesday I count 13x 737 in just half a day..."
245,1189,"Terrible airport overall. Poor service offering, speccialy food-wise. Very far from town and taxi the only way to get on and off. Small and old. Unbelivable is Chile's second biggest transportation hub."
246,1190,was this really an airport?
247,1198,"Aeropuerto pequeño, con sólo un café en el área de embarque, caro y malo. Cuenta con buen wifi actualmente, gratuito y una oficina de turismo."
248,1205,Muy lento el proceso de ingreso al aeropuerto. El control COVID mas lento de lo esperado. Tomen su tiempo. En gran parte problema de la gente que no lleva su documentación y la busca estando en la puerta.
249,1209,"Small airport, very slow check-in. You can wait in open air for boarding."
250,1210,so small it's difficult to rate
251,1215,"There's no public transport to the city. Uber is ilegal, but it's twice cheaper than taxi (takes 20 mins until the city center). In PUQ it's obligated to bring a fresh PCR test, so everyone should wait on the street/cold entrance while airport stuff is checking all the PCRs (yes, it's really windy and cold, flu guaranteed). Inside the airport there's almost nothing, only one cafe (with coffee from an automatic machine!) and a souvenir shop. 2 bathrooms and that's all."
252,1216,"Easy to go to the airport, 10000CLP by taxi. Self check-in available for LAN flights. Wi-Fi is a nightmare. The lounge is a joke, the area is clearly not enough large for all the passengers it çust welcome. Only beverages and newspapers... The landside restaurant is very long to serve. I set - 5 min later I take a card BY MYSELF - 5 çim later I left. No one came to take my order. But airside is worth. It closed 30min before the departure of my flight... at 13h20!! I just found a cake on an automatic machine. That is a DISASTER!!"
253,1217,"Wrong finger hit, new finger required for international arrival"
254,1223,"There's not very many good connections from the city to the airport. A metro or subway would make it better. The domestic and international terminals are not connected, and they are quite a hike. Security is pretty lax, with X-RAY operators letting most stuff pass that other airports around the world don't. No Premium access for security. Terminal is ancient itself."
255,1224,"Incredibly bad airport. There are no clear signs for hotel shuttles. Approaching the information desk for assistance, they also do not know where that location is. I went to 2 separate help desks, and both suggested to use a taxi, even though my hotel provides a shuttle. The layout of the check in area is also very chaotic. There is no organization going on."
256,1235,"Most of the shops closed during the night, Wi-Fi not working, Air China transfer lounge is disappointment - there are only drinks and a few snacks, no Wi-Fi (only non-working airport Wi-Fi). Long queue for immigration."
257,1236,extremely slow processing for customs and security. Airport is colder than any other place. Not much food options.
258,1237,After covid recovery of the airport is terrible. The international terminal sucks and there's almost nothing open and working properly. It is very cold in winter inside - wear too many layers of clothes and cover up yourself if you don't want to get sick in winter.
259,1240,"Don't like this airport, it is very busy. Transition between terminal 1 and 2 is really long, shuttle busses run every 30min. . Very hard to connect to Wi-Fi, it asks to type in your chinese telephone number to connect to the internet (as of Feb 2020), and what should I do if i don't have it? This airport is one of the worst I have ever been to."
260,1258,Terrible ground crew at the airport that basically violates the rules and guidelines set by the airline.
261,1259,This is still one of the most inefficient airports that I know. Check-in took a long time and emigration as well as security check was so slow as they only opened 3 counters in total at the international departure part
262,1261,Lounge was disgusting. Dirty and no hot food options. Also couldn't check-in until 2 hrs before the flight.
263,1262,"Airport is fairly new, but immigration/customs took forever. They need to have more lines to accommodate the amount of travelers. Also landing at a remote station and being bused to the terminal is annoying."
264,1263,"Lack of retail and food options. Until the metro line is up, quite difficult to get to on the express buses. Only two immigration counters opened for international terminal. Airside only one starbucks and a handful of random duty free and local food shops."
265,1264,I had traveled from Chengdu to Lhasa. This flight is international Chengdu - Lhasa - Katmandu. To check-in for Katmandu destination you should go in T1 terminal. To check-in for domestic flight to Lhasa i had to pass to T2 terminal. I wasted my time and money to meet check-in in time! WiFi is very very bad!
266,1270,"International terminal is quite small, maybe five or six jetways. 30-50 minutes is enough for transfering between international flights. Two shops and one restaurant after customs on departure side."
267,1276,"Too small. Airport security locked us in because the lower floor (where immigration, baggage claim was) was completely congested, and you had to log in with some Chinese app to use the Wi-Fi. Baggage claim was too small and it was nearly impossible to get a place in the crowd."
268,1278,"It's lacking. Yea, it has a McDonald's, but I was at gate 15 for a layover and it was 5 gates away; this airport isn't like US Airports where 5 gates is nothing, here, 5 gates is like half a kilometer"
269,1279,The ground crew give poor service and is extremely slow. Got 50 people in a line but the crew was very reluctant to open another counter. At last we waited for 1 hour to get into gate in this small airport! While we were waiting the crew even typed my friend’s name wrong on the flight ticket but she didn’t even feel sorry by saying ‘I can’t hold it anymore.’ And then when we got into the gate people were jumping the queue but the crew did nothing to stop them and even let them jump in line after us. OMG.
270,1287,"Such a nice new airport. But when a light pulls up on arrival terminal and then you still get picked up in a bus and brought over to Customs, that just plain ""cheap"". not sure if I need to blame the carrier (MU) or the airport (CAN) for it."
271,1294,"Guilin airport has the potential to be a good airport, but they need to correct two things : -The airport speaker has to understand that she does not have to continuously announce the same 6 flights for 2 hours, very loudly and without taking a breath -The toilets could be clean and offer toilet paper to the passengers"
272,1296,"a very small airport (at least for Chinese dimensions), with open gate seating and thus quite noisy"
273,1302,"Because PEK TSRA, we are waiting in a no food and cold terminal...hopefully one guy know a local people and she help me to buy KFC and let the Immigration bring to us.....It is the best food in that time."
274,1307,"I HATE LIVING IN HZ..TOO FAR TO GO ON THE PLANE NOT MANY FOOD CHOICE IF IT ARRIVES AFTER 9PM, MAYBE ONLY THE STAIRS ARE AVAILABLE CUSTOMS OVER PACKED"
275,1310,"Actually Quzhou, not in the list"
276,1321,"The airport is very small, there are NO ATMs (so get your USD ready well in advance if you're thinking of getting a visa on arrival should you be heading somewhere in Southeast Asia), and the only money exchange bureau past customs was not open according to schedule and charged 120 CNY per exchange, which is ridiculous!!!"
277,1330,Awful NanJing airport. Immigration was slow need to wait in line. Officials were loud and rude. Real name authentication required to connect to WiFi. Airport has few stores and restaurants. It's a slum.
278,1331,The disgusting NJ airport. Awful cumbersome form of security check. Overly rigid. Not much in the way of places to eat. Internet access requires real name authentication. Extremely poor experience.
279,1332,It's bad. The security check was tedious and lengthy. Not enough restaurants and supermarkets. It's desolate.
280,1337,No subway
281,1342,"For domestic flights at least, I thought that the facilities were lacking. Before check in it looked promising, a KFC and a few shops. After check-in you are in a holding pen with no good shops or eateries, and are barred from the international terminal area. The only reprieve is there is a mass of seating available"
282,1357,"Unfortunately, in my point of view, Hongqiao itself should be called as CHINA EASTERN AIRLINES airport, the airport which only serves for passengers and planes of this company and all others are outside the check islands. If you take a CZ flight to go to Beijing, Chengdu or Shenzhen, go to counter B11+ of island B And at the same time it was a burst of 20th century industry, a power outlet is equipped every 4 rows of seats. Super annoying."
283,1358,Middle of winter and they deboard A350 by bus which took over 10 minutes in sub 0 temperatures. Ridiculous airport as always!! Economy baggage arrived before the priority.
284,1359,"Transfer from airport building to the aircraft at the other side of the airport in a fully crowded bus during pandemic is not desirable... The flight was to Beijing, a city with very strict pandemic rules."
285,1366,"It always amazes me how 2 airport in the same have such a different service level. Hongqiao, a great airport, thinks work. Pudong an absolute disaster, especially internationally. Immigration is slow, (unless you can use the e-channel), but even then you wait roughly 1h or more for your luggage. Plan with 1,5h to leave the airport after touchdown."
286,1367,"The worst airport I have ever been to. No facilities in terminal 1. No restaurants, duty free, cafe."
287,1372,"Shanghai was one of the worst Airports I have been to. It got better since the satellite opened, but was annoys me most is the fact, that Air traffic control can't sort planes to the most convenient runway to avoid too much ground movement. One 2 hour flight took 3 hours 30 due to 1h 30 minutes rolling to the position. Therefore 2 stars."
288,1373,"It is during the 2022 lockdown, but everything was closed and the things you had to do were all ""right now"" and extreme. For example, at departure you have to scan two separate codes and fill in all your details. One is to get into the terminal (wasn't too bad, basic information) but you have to do it at the entrance. There is seemingly no opportunity to fill it in at home, you have to do it while standing in the front of the terminal door. Of course for me it didn't work because it insists on sending you an SMS code to your WeChat phone number - which I don't have. However, they managed to work around that. At customs, you have to fill in another App, again, seemingly no opportunity to do it in advance. This is very intrusive as it asks for all sorts of information - including other than China where have you been before - we were two years in China - so this seemed fairly redundant. And, you can't say not applicable - you have to give it something, we just made up some BS and put that in. It also asked alot of irrelevant questions for departure (relevant for arrival, but didn't seem so for departure). All in all this was took ages to fill in, you do it inside the ""lining up"" area and as a result there was lots of congestion. Finally, the security check was over the top. The signs and first security guy says the standard ""laptops and liquids"" need to be taken out. But post X-Ray, everything - including USB cables, Power cables, phone chargers, even my house keys - had to be taken out, visually inspected and rescanned through the XRay machine. This was happening to everybody. Finally it was all very random. My wife had a 50ml Hand sanitiser attached to her bag, they confiscated that, but they let me take a 100ml spray bottle of lens cleaner, and they didn't find (despite the rigorous scanning and visual inspection) her replacement bottle of hand sanitiser (the confiscated one was almost empty). The whole experience of getting into the airport was very draining - but we didn't have much choice. Also, it took about 4 hours to complete the checkin and entry. Once we finally got past all that, we arrived at the gate lounge, sat down, started eating a steamed bun that we brought with us (no shops were open) and they gave a ""final boarding call""."
289,1382,under construction
290,1384,Under construction
291,1389,No English speaking personnel. And their is no restaurant where you can pay with foreign credit cards.
292,1394,a mess of an airport
293,1399,a very simple and crude airport very few restaurants and shops in the lounge no matter in restricted area or the departure hall check-in spent a lot of time lots of red tape in security checking wifi is unstable
294,1406,Pretty bad airport. It is a small airport with a large number flights. The checking port is not enough. There is not automatic boarding machine. The staffs are so cold.
295,1411,"Very slow baggage claim and immigration when more than one international flights arrive. Though there is more than adequate facilities, the officers/staffs were in severe shortage. It took me more than an hour from landing till getting out the customs."
296,1413,It is an extremely small airport. There is nothing you can do except going to the bathroom if you are transferring at Wuhan airport. Don't expect WiFi there.
297,1414,"Pretty bad airport.The service there is very RUDE.Int'l terminal hasn't boarding bridge. Service here is very slack, wireless network can not connect.The Lobby is full of chinese t tourists."
298,1418,"This airport is no longer used. Instead, a new airport called ""Wuhan Tianhe Airport"" is currently the only airport in Wuhan."
299,1421,"Maybe it's a weapons airfield, so it's forbidden to photograph here. But so there is nothing to see."
300,1422,"One of the worst airports I've experienced. It's miles away from downtown. Check-in started nearly an hour later than stated. Security wasn't prepared for passengers to start going thru, the public WiFi isn't available to foreigners, and the lounge is a box with some chairs."
301,1423,"In the case of Xi'an International Airport, it was ranked first as an airport that could not be given a high score at all. The interior of the airport reflects communist ideology, and the threatening attitude of customs officials and public security upon entry is the biggest factor that makes people reluctant to visit China. Security screening at the time of flight departure is the same as the security screening system implemented in most countries, and you must pass through the metal detector if the alarm does not sound. However, all airports in China have a blatant and offensive security screening system regardless of whether there is a metal detector or not. That's why I can't give it a good score. The food in Chinese airports is not very tasty and the Wi-Fi service is also located in China, so we cannot give it a good score due to restrictions on the use of services such as Line and KakaoTalk."
302,1424,"very very slow check-in(MU) it took 30 minutes for 6 peoples and their face is very bad. Also the security check took me 40 minutes, I talk to the officer my flight is already final call, but they don't care about it. final call at 1240 but when i finish my Security check is already 1300,luckily MU is wait for me because it still have some passages even later. I almost miss my flight!!!"
303,1426,"Bad experience Worst first class lounge I have tried Even seat at the check in area is ""limited"", can't find one to sit"
304,1427,"No convenient public transpot available at T3, staff not friendly, not helpful, not able to understand simple English word."
305,1430,"relatively cold/unfriendly ground staff. WiFi didn't work. Domestic lounge is basic, but at least it's clean."
306,1431,"Pretty confusing int'l to domestic transit scheme. There's a long walk from the gate to immigration, followed by a confusing situation where you have to leave the secure airside and recheck into your domestic flight as if you just arrived at the airport. The domestic lounge is pretty basic. I couldn't get the lounge WiFi to work."
307,1433,Airport infrastructure is not catching up with high demand of international flights. Prepare for 1 hr cue for custom immigration and security screening. my flight was departing in the late afternoon
308,1439,Small Airport and VIP lounge stuff is totally unfriendly
309,1441,Very poor airport
310,1456,"At the time, the airport is passing through major remodelation, for that reason the check.in and baggage claim zones are tents."
311,1457,Departure Gate 7
312,1470,"Full ""routine"" check as always, felt like a criminal. Why does that ""random"" check happens 100% of my international flights from Cali."
313,1472,Most people only speak spanish at the airport and signs are mostly also in spanish... But if one was on an airport before you can find what you need...
314,1473,"The airport does not have electrical connectors in the counter area, only close to the boarding gates."
315,1476,"Airport is a disaster, poor coordination of Gate staff, terrible facilities, no possibility of eating something in peace. In short, this beautiful city is not prepared for tourism."
316,1477,Small airport with very few amenities past security. Congested and crowded with all planeside boarding.
317,1494,For the 4th time. Over 500 people and Immigration had only 6 agents. It took over 1 hour 25 minutes to get through. I'm thinking about flying into Bogota and transferring to a domestic Medellin flight in future.
318,1506,"A fairly old airport, basic services, they are building a new one, I hope it is up to par with the city"
319,1516,"It's always hot in San Andres and there is NO air conditioning, except inside the boarding area (the international boarding area opens 1h30 before the scheduled time of departure). Security check is a joke. First you must have something stamped at the check-in area. Then, when you're allowed to enter the boarding area, there is a person who gets your documents and types something in a computer. Then, 20 feet ahead, there is another person with another computer who checks your passport. After that you pass through a small duty free and you think it's over. Wrong! Right at the entrance of the boarding zone there's another person behind a big table who requests you to open your hand luggage to be inspected. After some time, when you're waiting to be called to the gate, a lady approaches you and asks you your passport number. I have been to many international airports, big and small, in developed and undeveloped countries, including paranoid countries, and I've never seen anything like I did in San Andres."
320,1530,"Not the best airport in the world, its extremely hot when you arrive in RAR, and the fans don't help much"
321,1531,great small airport in the Pacific
322,1532,Customs confiscated my fudge!!
323,1538,"Slow staff, slow immigration process, panhandlers and scammers outside the terminal, and no transit to get there."
324,1547,"In lounge terms, probably the worst lounges I've ever stayed in around the world. Even neighboring Santo Domingo has a way better lounge than here and that says a lot. In the airport, WiFi is really slow and food services leave much to be desired. Otherwise, check-in and security check was fairly easy and straightforward."
325,1550,"Getting to the airport was easy, with a shuttle bus. The airport doesn't accept mobile boarding passes (but they accept regular boarding pass shown on a phone). Security check was disorganised, it took us 40 minutes to pass security, the queue was super long and 2 queues merged together in chaos. The terminal facilities are OK, but there are almost none food options. there were only two cafés selling cold salads and baguettes (they didn't even heat it - they have no ovens). Lounge is open to only business class flyers and does not accept any lounge passes. Besides, boarding was disorganised as well - it seemed like the airport didn't communicate properly with the airline."
326,1551,Dubrovnik airport was a very disappointed experience! What an expensive airport for anything and the services are equivalent to low cost airport.
327,1554,The airprot was very tiny and crowded. Long queues and lots of noise everywhere. Did not really enjoy the design or how the airprot is built.
328,1556,"Most shops closed in winter. Wifi only free for 30 min. If passengers checked in online, they cannot print boarding pass at automatic machine."
329,1561,3 flights checking in at once all leaving around the same time. Airport too small to handle that many people at once at check in and through security.
330,1562,Domestic departure gate is without A/C and during the summer that is not normal! Nothing to buy at departure gate as well.
331,1564,They didn't announce the delay of our flight in the gate displays nor there was any staff member to inform. We just sat there waiting for the plane to arrive.
332,1570,Деревенский аэропорт.
333,1574,"Like in the Sowjet Union in the 1950/60s... Duty free closed during the season, coffee shop with one slow girl behind the bar and an open terrace to look after the planes (and to announcements about boarding or something like this)... It's not 2013!"
334,1575,Really bad airport. check-in and security control lasted approximately 1h even though only 40 people were travelling. NOBODY SPEAK ENGLISH THERE!
335,1586,"Small airport, especially the lounge was the smallest I've ever experienced. Hardly any food or drink selection, mostly nuts, and some drinks in small glass bottles. Keep in mind there's only seats for 10 guests total."
336,1590,Free Wifi available and works really good when not so crowded. As more people arrive it just got really slow and almost unusable. There is only one restaurant to eat. The food was okay but price was too high for canteen food. Otherwise a nice tiny airport.
337,1594,"Empty airport, 10 min till gate, no need to hurry. No water bottle refill, no non alcoholic drinks in dutty free. Little coca colla bottle in restaurants costs like beer or wine."
338,1595,"As usual in Zagreb, custom check is slow, only few people working without will to live, dont mention working"
339,1601,"No jet bridge, you walk into a small cube basically and go through customs. You don't really find the 'friendly' staff until you pass the customs booth. No services available on the arrivals side. Bathrooms were.. worthy of skipping and waiting until you were on the bus taking you to your resort. Best thing about the airport was the baggage claim. (other than being bit by bugs waiting); no other plane was there so you quickly got your luggage without hassle. Transfers from the airport were neatly organized as well. Your resort shuttle will most likely also have cold beer for purchase."
340,1604,"Even though the baggs were marked and tagged PRIORITY, there definately nothing prioritized about the baggage delivery."
341,1607,Long wait.. but everyone else is waiting with you so your not going anywhere
342,1609,"Horrible airport and very rude staff since from the arrival, passing throught the Immigration, security, baggage claims. In my experience it was the worst airport I've ever been."
343,1610,Old fashioned airport. Terminal 2 is very old and has hardly no facilities. Your cuban money (CUC) isn't worth nothing anymore. Just US dollars you need to buy a drink.
344,1611,"Genuinely dreadful airport that feels like it's straight from the 60's. It feels very unsafe, you are nearly forced to get a taxi there, the check-in is slow and the security/baggage handing is the slowest I have ever seen. But hey, you're in Cuba, can't expect too much - but the comparison is not a good one compared to other places!"
345,1612,"Jose Marti is an airport in a socialist country, so understandably it is far from Western standards. The only acceptable way to get there would be by taxi, which can be pretty pricy. Inside the international security zone only USD, CAD, and CUP are accepted, so spend the CUCs you have before the screening. Baggage claim is super slow, WiFi is not available. Staff is friendly and helpful."
346,1613,"Really poor airport but it's Cuba so it was expected. Long queues for everything, no wifi, terrible food and drink options. Nice views of the runway while waiting for my flight though which was nice."
347,1614,"If you want to use WiFi, make sure you buy Esteca card in advance. Security check is a mess. Shopping and bars are messy, no cards, as everywhere else in Cuba. They accept euro cash, though, at a relatively decent rate (1:1)."
348,1615,"There is really nothing to do. Nothing to shop. Dirty toilets. No public transport from/to airport, only overpriced taxi. Staff is unfriendly."
349,1616,Immigration and Baggage claim are pretty good. Arrival lounge are mostly full of people. It's better to get Cuban currency at the bureau there at the airport instead of the city centre.
350,1617,"There's no too many options by getting into Jose Martí International Airport.Taxi costs around 25 CUC.(If your trip after midnight some hotels charged you around 5 CUC for the night shifts). Bars and coffe shops are sometimes ""closed"" with the staff checking the stock of beverages and food they have in front of you. Air conditioner is really strong,even during early morning. Security and Immigration process are pretty fast.But during the X- ray control, officers doesn't look very professional at all. Wi-fi is only available at the departure lounge (You have to buy the ETECSA card in advance).It's hard to get it ,but if you give it a try, you can go at the offices in La Habana Vieja.Where you have to queue about 3 hours. Terminal facilities are basic and a lot of souverins stores surrounding the lobby area. The departure lounge has an small Duty Free shop where you can pay in CUC or Credit card .It's one of the only places you can use electronic paying methods. You can also find a lot of products from other Central - american countries. Mostly candies and cookies."
351,1618,"Dreadful airport. Over an hour and a half to check in, duty free shop (only one) had massive queue as not enough staff. Queue for ""fast food"" place (again, only one) was halfway along the airport, the urinals in the men's toilets were all broken. Over an hour sitting on the 'plane waiting for bags to be loaded."
352,1622,Our end of the terminal was very hot. Wifi is only 30 mins and tied to your passport number so use it sparingly.
353,1623,"awful airport, extremely long queues everywhere. Only 1 flight at a time, but it takes hours to pass registration, border and security check."
354,1624,"Cut lock off my bag and stole phone charger, toothpaste, and deodrant. Staff are scammers trying to sell yo back your currency at a reduced exchange rate."
355,1625,"Terrible Sunwing subcontractor check-in experience. Asked for 3 seats together, was told there weren't any available, yet our friends who were far behind us in line got 3 seats together, even though their seats were not pre-booked. Overcrowded, stuffy, old lounge. Seriously overpriced goods at shops."
356,1626,This is a very small airport that is a ghost town the one moment and get's overcrowded the moment the A330s land.
357,1627,"Small basic airport. This airport basically caters to tourists, so naturally the duty free shops are filled with rum and cigars. Airbridge was broken the day we went, gave bus to go to terminal. Bit crowded."
358,1628,I want to fly to Cuba!
359,1637,"Overcrowded - spent more than 2 hours standing in huge queues for check-in, security control, passport control. Too much stress. I found i it totally unavailable for elderly or passengers with minor (but still) problems to stand for so much time."
360,1638,"Horribe Toilets, horriblen and confusing gate. You really don´t know which gate. wifi is also weak. But at least shops and security check is nice."
361,1639,Incompetent ground staff that are not trained in Airlines Pre-check systems. Result- slow boarding progress. The security staff is far below industry standard and does not fulfill IATA standards. Luggage is not checked thoroughly.
362,1650,Despite Covid they have made people to crowed within very small area with no chance to keep the right disctance.
363,1656,"WIFI hasn't been working for more than 4 years. The smoking place is not sealed and half of the terminal smells by cigarettes. After passport control, you can't buy anything and finally, the air condition is not working even when it's 30C outisde (the glass roof doesn't help at all)."
364,1658,"Normally a nice little airport but there were only 6 flights all day and the airport seemed manic, only 2 immigration officers for 200 people, no accurate queuing system to buy food from the only cafe past security, half the staff don't speak English....the same person doing the security machine was inspecting individual bags, meaning that a queues were being built up, people flying out of non-schepgen don't have enough seats after passport control....."
365,1659,Unlike the airline Brno airport is a shambles!!! The airport is completly crowded with no were to seat. Yes its modern but its tiny!!! There are only 3 places to shops. Two Reasturants and one duty free. Than you need to make your way to one of the 7 gates (which they never use). If your travelling with Ryanair to London Stansted than your most likely to board via gate no.5 this is because you need to go thourgh additional security and a passport check. In addition there are only one set of toilets and that is after security. And dont get me started on security!!!
366,1662,Flight from Kunovice
367,1663,Clean but uncomfortable. Rude & impolite staff. after Sec. very limited chance to buy some drinks or food. Just one girl is staff in refreshments store (if is not closed...) Just one possitive: WiFi without restrictions and for free...
368,1668,"I thought that there's nothing worse than Charleoroi Airport, but is. It looks like a big train station, almost impossible to get there (train that goes three times a day doesnt even match the time of the flights - weird, when there are like 2 flight per day)"
369,1675,"Someone calling this airport? Poor terminal facilities, not possible to get to Ostrava from there at 10pm apart from taking a taxi. On departures gates have been overcrowded with drunk czech holidaymakers. Ufff, next time I will think twice to book my flight here."
370,1678,"Public transport is the cheapest way to get there, but an hour from city center is a joke. Seriously, a joke. The prices at the airport - seriously? If you absolutely need to buy anything, go to Billa before security check. Everything behind security check is a ""theft."" Security check in itself... Compared to airports like Frankfurt or Helsinki, they demand you to remove your laptop from your backpack etc."
371,1682,"They loaded us into a bus for more than half an hour, to avoid paying delay fees (which thanks to the wind was more than likely)."
372,1688,"It is not an airport really, it looks like a small Greyhound station from the 60’s but without the amenities ... even back then (!) It’s just a large extremely dirty loud room with 2 counters to check in... and 200 packed passengers shouting. A few military guards to check your ID and flight ticket, no metallic portal, no computer, no seat, no toilet. I went once only to pick up someone. I was astonished. I flew to other airports in third-world countries, this is the worst I’ve seen so far. It is also extremely dangerous if you are not familiar with the area - in times of war as well as peace. Update: just saw travelers’ pictures, the airport now has seats and sells drinks (2020)"
373,1691,Departure from Ndjili is a headache !! Very bad organisation of check-in and departure formalities !
374,1692,Stop in Douala
375,1711,"Very small airport. Seems odd when it serves the 2nd largest city in Denmark. Only way to get to the airport is by car, taxi or bus from Aarhus. Don't expect extravaganza terminal boutiques or food places. I think they have 15 flight, pr. day! Friendly staff though"
376,1713,"Nice local airport, but with very small taxfree shopping and you have to walk out to the airplane (Short walk)"
377,1717,"Very bad airport location. It takes forever to come back home. If you land after 23:00, forget about the bus and pay fortunes in taxi because te airport is located in the middle of nowhere. 160€ of taxi to reach Esbjerg (70 km), 240€ of taxi to Reach Aarhus (100 km). Airlines should have a look at maps before serving a 11,000 people town."
378,1718,Ground access time is too long. The airport is badly situated. Airlines should serve Aarhus and Esbjerg instead of this airport.
379,1719,"Worst location ever for an airport, fare from any city. I would prefer airlines to serve Aarhus or Esbjerg, rather than this ultra low cost location. It looks like reaching Beauvais or Bergamo, but with very expensive tickets. This is not a good experience."
380,1720,The airport is too far from any big city. I am waisting my time just to reach this location in the middle of nowhere. Airlines should better serve Aarhus and Esbjerg instead of this ultra low-cost location.
381,1723,"First airport where you can’t get your baby stroller to the plane door. Also they start the embarking but the plane is not ready, we stayed just in cold in the airbridge, but people that boarded trough back door of the plane also needed to wait in rain."
382,1737,I've spend there 3h waiting for the plane. Chairs are extremely uncomfortable - no facilities on terminal - no shop no food etc.
383,1750,"No SIM card agency inside and as we really need to have internet, we got scammed for buying SIM card from some private dude (1000 pesos for 5GB for 5 days which is too lot). Crowds of different guys looking for bussiness (taxi, trips). Uber has some extra fee for geting to and back from airport. Recommend using inDrive (which we did not know then)."
384,1751,Extremely inefficient. Took forever to taxi and get bags. Inside of airport was fine. Very limited food/retail
385,1754,"The airport decided to separate arrivals and departures in diferent buildings, with no connection between them. When we arrived and passed through the fast and organized immigration and customs, we go to a room with no A/C even in a 40°C heat, surrounding by travel agents and taxi drivers (Uber is just allowed in the external perimeter of the airport) with the usual harassment, charging extremely higher fees to tourists. Don't be scared to be rude to them and don't show signs of weakness."
386,1756,How many times do I need to show my passport to get off this island? Security area too small post screening. Crappy and expensive eating options. Does the air conditioning work? How does the tip begging band get past security?
387,1762,JetBlue check-in was terrible. Forced to wait for over one hour for some ESTA check which was completely unnecessary as ESTA was accepted and already used in JFK on the way to Dom. Rep.
388,1763,"The worst arrival process I have experienced in Latin America along with Guatemala City. Their customs staff and infrastructure is inefficient, terrible. And it's always the same."
389,1769,It needs to be expanded and a longer runway. dangerous for the city.
390,1782,"Beautiful, very modern."
391,1783,Why isn't the new airport on the map?
392,1791,"Lack of good signage so I stod in the wrong queue, there was really no organization here. Turmoil to say the least."
393,1792,Landed in the middle of the night and there were long queues which didn’t move. There were also some communication problems between the officers in the immigration Beyond the lack of knowing the English language. I ended up being sent back and forth between different lines.
394,1793,"EgyptAir lost my luggage and gave me contact information and promised to reply in time. After waiting for four days, there was no reply at all, which is really incomprehensible"
395,1794,"Cairo Terminal 3 seems run down at best even if it's the newest. A few food outlet, horrendously overpriced. Bring your own drinks and food, you can board with them! There are charging stations with safes for the phones, not one works. Only one lounge for StarAlliance Gold members. Toilets have the annoying attendants. Security check personnel rude and numerous times. Why do they scan your luggage if then you have to let them open it and run their dirty hands through it?"
396,1797,"As mentioned before: the airport borders on chaos, just like the city of Cairo. Confusing and with poor signage."
397,1802,"AVOID THIS AIRPORT BY ALL COST. The worst part is the staff. Refusing to board a flight because of some ancient retarded charter flight ""rules"", ok. But the amount of BS they tell you after asking which rule this is based on and who defines this rule. They don't know it themselves but can't admit that, so they invent any amount of BS they want. They say ""we want to help you"" while in fact all they do is the opposite, they obstruct your legal right to leave the country with a valid passport, valid visa, valid airline ticket, all documents valid and on time for check in. AVOID THIS AIRPORT BY ALL COST."
398,1805,"15min of WIFI, 7 (!!!) different passport control, zero organization, toilet with payments (or with people asking for money, just cause they can), a lot of weird request for money from random people, really exhausting experience"
399,1806,"Upon arrival, we got our visa pretty quick and the facilities were actually pretty clean. But as we were heading back to Düsseldorf - the tour guide couldn't speak proper German and the division between the terminals was confusing. At the first baggage check, the staff was really rude and kept yelling at us. The rest was pretty chill"
400,1807,"Horrible! The staff treat the passengers like cattle. They shout incomprehensible orders, they shout at you if you don't understand. They are rude, aggressive, arrogant, contemptuous and discriminating."
401,1808,"This was, by far, the worst airport experience we've ever had. The security people were very unkind and downright rude. They did not want to let the less than 4 year old boy together through the security with his mother, because he's MALE. HE WAS LESS THAN A 4 YEARS OLD BOY!! So, thanks for nothing, Hurghada. Will not see you again."
402,1809,"terrible airport ever. Toilets 2 euros, food overpriced up to 30 euros for fries + burgers and the shops are all outdated. too few staff for too many passengers.."
403,1812,"Long security (two checks). A pleasant shopping area but before the second security checks. On the other hand, absolutely no commerce in the departure lounge (only for international flights) which is really disappointing."
404,1819,Duty free area needs increasing in size and selection of goods
405,1821,"After the baggage carousel, the luggage has to go through a security check, of which there is only one, so several hundred people can only drop off their bags at one carousel, which leads to long waiting times. The terminal is very disorganized and it takes a while to figure out what to do."
406,1825,"Very awful airport. Dirty toilets, no wifi, noisy staff. Security check is terrible! Three Duty free shops, two are EgyptAir Duty free. But vacation in Marsa Alam area is so perfect."
407,1826,POOR SERVICES
408,1827,"airport adapted only for charter flights. Dirty, bad service and focused only on making money off tourists."
409,1829,"toilets were horrible and messy, the queues were so slow it took 2 hours to get through 2 security checks and bag drop"
410,1830,Incompetent staff - fight was delayed because they were laughing around not properly boarding people. No info offered during thus time. WiFi didn't work
411,1835,Russophobes are fucking and roosters. At check-in they ask strange questions and threaten to not let you on the flight. Border guards don’t know what Montenegro is
412,1836,The worst airport staff in the world? I am amazed how terrible the behavior of the staff was at this airport...
413,1837,"They check too meticulously, but more for show than for real purpose. The fast line is simply implemented through a person who, for money, takes you to the beginning of the same line where everyone else is standing (people in the line snort, of course). Wi-Fi connects for only 15 minutes."
414,1838,"17.10.2020 - обычная проверка на входе - обыск босиком, бахилы не предлагают. Через 10 метров 5 человек роются в наших чемоданах постоянно говоря что это в салон нельзя, хотя я им 5 раз сказал что это багаж. Перерыли чемодан полностью, уложить обратно не дают - идите отсюда. После сдачи багажа ещё обыск ручной клади. 15! минут босиком у рамки в ожидании когда закончится перерыв у того кто обыскивает. После ещё 2 обыска. Один охранник забрал хорошую ручку, второй шоколадку. От кондиционера пар изо рта идёт. А перекладывая постоянно вещи и стоя босиком потеешь. После пришлось на борту горячий час за 5 евро покупать. Пятый раз в Египте, третий раз в этом аэропорту. Они одичали. Больше ни ногой в Египет. 10/17/2020 - the usual check at the entrance - a search with bare feet, shoe covers are not offered. After 10 meters, 5 people rummage in our suitcases, constantly saying that this is not allowed in the salon, although I told them 5 times that this is luggage. They ransacked the suitcase completely, they do not allow to put it back - get out of here. After checking in your baggage, you will still search your hand luggage fifteen! minutes barefoot at the frame, waiting for the end of the break for the one who searches. After 2 more searches. One guard took a good pen, the other a chocolate bar. Steam from the mouth comes from the air conditioner. And constantly shifting things and standing barefoot sweat. After that I had to buy a hot hour on board for 5 euros. Fifth time in Egypt, third time at this airport. They went wild. No more foot to Egypt. Sorry my english."
415,1842,Gad an extra day because of snow back home.
416,1843,the location of Taba Airport is not correct. Please correct it. The real coordinates are 29°35′16″N 34°46′41″E
417,1855,Friendly service / friendly service
418,1869,"Given it's an airport with only one daily flight, you can't expect a lot. You get luggage quickly as there are no other flights. Two counters for check-in, one security control line which may have some queue but there's really no need to rush to the gate as there are no shops or bars there. There's also a good airport shuttle service. A minibus is waiting in front of the terminal and takes you to any address in Tartu you want for €5. For the departing flight, you can pre-order the shuttle to your address in Tartu and there are some stops where you don't need a pre-order."
419,1872,"You have to wait at least an hour at the passport control. I had a priority tag on my luggage, they ripped it off not to send it via Priority belt. (everytime I fly to Addis their ground services does the same thing) So DONT WAIT FOR YOUR LUGGAGE ON THE PRIORITY BELT. Once you get your luggage, their is another xray scan before you leave the building, you have to wait at least half an hour on the queue. WORST ARRIVAL EXPERIENCE IN THE WORLD"
420,1873,They took my lighter both times when I was transferring. I made like hundred flights in past years but only here they took the lighter.
421,1875,Chaotic boarding procedure and very little flight information. Travelled through as a transfer passenger.
422,1876,"Fair enough, we arrived very early and we were the only plane on the mass of tarmac in front of the terminal. The part of the terminal we were in looked and felt very old. There were no shops open, the Business Lounge was closed, nothing. It wasn't until we had sat out in the walkway for a couple of hours that someone came and opened the lounge. Wasn't impressed."
423,1880,"We came from an international flight and had to get to the next international flight and the completely unnecessary security check just annoyed everyone. Waiting time around 1.5 hours, sometimes with hundreds of people in rows in a room with a ceiling height of around 2.20 m. The worst thing I've experienced in a long time."
424,1882,"It is a military airport, so you feel like a prisoner of war there. Photos cannot be taken. and everything is guarded."
425,1883,"I fought in the Argentina v UK War of the Falkland Islands for UK but now I am a member of staff at Mount Pleasant Airport I have to say, it has very good facilities and the shop is great, nice to pop in the shop if you are going on a holiday there."
426,1884,The airfield is on the military base so access is restricted. It has three check-in desks and a small souvenir shop. All the handling is by the military
427,1885,Taken to check in way too early
428,1886,Basically MPA is a military airfield linking the Falkland Islands with the UK. It also handles a weekly Lan Chile flight to Santiago as well as some FIGAS inter island flights.
429,1896,Took forever to clear border control before we arrived I had heard of Fiji time certainly happened here
430,1902,TRANSIT
431,1907,Extremely long walk to the baggage claim nowadays compared to the time before the latest renovation. Finding your way to the parking garage P3 is rather difficult and confusing because of the ongoing renovation and missing signage.
432,1908,Baggage claim very slow - waited 30 mins at carousel. Taxi ripoff - got charged €54 instead of normal €27. Now know to always ask the price beforehand.
433,1909,Took over an hour to get through security. Only 3 out of 20 or so security lanes operational. Check in zone crazy.
434,1917,"Lost luggage, poor service in this case. No personal after arrival. Airport open from 05:00, not earlier !"
435,1923,"If you go during finish winter holidays it's awful, but other times it's okay. Not enough seats etc. for the big number of passengers during Easter and Christmas..."
436,1928,The only thing to do is a cafe.
437,1934,ok
438,1935,"Home airport, but not most frequently flown out/in. Small terminal must be fully packed when Ryan Air's 737 departs or arrives. Can watch the approaches and departures from my living room."
439,1936,Really really really tiny airport. Only two toilets and no shop/food service after covid. Customs are really friendly and WIFI works fine for working. Difficult to get to the airport since it's pretty far from Mariehamn (No walkway for the first 10 min until you get closer to Mariehamn City but the airport is on a quiet street so it works if needed about 40 min walk to town)
440,1950,Airport should not allow that many passenger flights since there is no capacity in the terminal. Standing in the queue for the security check for more than 45mins.
441,1951,Where were all Taxis? No free ones in sight despite a full flight arriving. It is still winter in Lapland after all. On the plus side of things: the baggage claim was quick!
442,1955,"The airport is way too small. Whole airport was very crowded, espacially the check-in. Rovaniemi needs an expansion!"
443,1958,raining
444,1963,"Most days 3 fights land around 0:30 in Tampere (From Helsinki, Stockholm and Riga). Getting a taxi can take up to one hour. If you go to city center, take the local TKL bus and if you are going somewhere else, pre-order your taxi online to avoid waiting 1 hour outside."
445,1964,"It really matters are you travelling via terminal 1 or 2. Because terminal 1 is the proper new one, although small - but the size has its advantages. Terminal 2 is the old terminal which is renovated for Ryanair and it is like an old bus terminal. It does not feel like an airport at all, very bizarre experience. This review is for this trip which was from terminal 2 with Ryanair."
446,1965,"The airport is really small, the personnel is kind and check-in and security checks are usually fast. There is one urban bus line connecting the airport to city center (approx. 40 mins) and some shuttle services (approx 15mins) few times per day. Shuttles are just a little more expensive than the urban lines. Taxies are fairly expensive but it's possible to reserve (or call directly for the aiport) an airport taxi for around 20 euros pp. Terminal facilities, food and retail services are really inadequate and fairly expensive. Moreover, there is no smoking free area even though there are outside spaces. The latters really decrease the overall value of this airport."
447,1967,"Very small airport with no real services. But it is convenient to me, I'd rather leave from TMP than driving to HEL"
448,1970,No cafeteria outside the security and inside I think everything sold is made of gold dust if U look at the prices...
449,1973,"Horrible - without services - no duty free - just paper control, no scanner of passport or bordingpass."
450,1974,"Only one security control! Very, very slow! No food services or shops after security control. And not too much space, but quite nice new terminal."
451,1976,"Really small and old terminal. Passenger have to put his luggage on his own on the conveyor. Check-in is very slow. The staff write many things on a sheet of paper what takes time. Not enough places to have a seat. Bording priority pass and ""normal"" pass without visible difference, as if it was one queue."
452,1979,+ small o cheap _ far from terminal 2
453,1983,"Very small airport but all the flights seem to leave at the same time (around noon) so there is a 1-hour wait for the security check! Also: chaos at the gates, difficult to know what queue to join for one's flight... One positive note: arrival was good and quick."
454,1985,"Airport completely overwhelmed on this Saturday evening back. From check-in to the boarding lounge, the whole thing was difficult because it was crowded with people and waiting."
455,1987,small but very convenient when staff is not on strike
456,1990,Horrid doesn't begin to describe this airport. One step ahead of meeting your plane at a private airport with a grass runway.
457,1991,"I was directed to British passport holders queue ( nothing wrong with that ), after several minutes other British passport holders were waved to the European passport holders only queue to join the front of the British passport holders queue so instead of being around 5 minutes of queuing it took 45 minutes to get throigh passport control"
458,1995,"Terrible border control, one single policeman to control hundreds of passengers is a joke. It took at least an hour to check everyone from our flight."
459,2004,"Traveled on 05/27/2019 and really very disappointed. The flight went very well but Bastia airport surprised me by its size which is tiny, by its organization which seems really chaotic. This is not at all practical."
460,2005,"A really tiny airport with no services. The luggage didn't take long to arrive, the only positive point."
461,2009,"The only thing we know here is Cyrano de Bergerac, the airport only offers Ryanair lines which according to studies is more expensive than Air France and offers much less things on board, well done local companies"
462,2011,"mmmm.. not quite what I excpected, security check is awful. the worst thing is when you arrive. the bags are put on a rolling rack not like Manchester,Glasgow EG. the worst bit is passport control. normally there is only one person checking passports so it can take ages and ages to get out. im used to it because I come here 3 times a year because my granddad lives here."
463,2012,"Bergerac Airport is very small. Has about 4 basic check-in desks with no luggage belt and poor security. In terms of food there is a cafe outside the terminal building but it doesn't look appealing. Inside the boarding lounge which is very small there are a few vending machines with all the usual snacks and drinks. When you arrive at the airport the passport control is inside a little hut. There is usually only one person checking the passports so it could take you a while to get through. When you go through passport control your luggage will be on a table round the corner from the passport control. Opposite this there is the toilets and the exit. Word of advice: If you don't have someone picking you up or you haven't got a hire car then you're stuffed, the airport is in the middle of nowhere!"
464,2013,"mmm, bergerac airport. i think that money is a problem here. they dont have basic things like a luggage belt. there is one small restaurant who seems a little bit dirty. there are only 2 or 3 busses going to the airport. so it's quite of difficult to get there. the employees are friendly and you can ask them for help where needed."
465,2014,The worst airport
466,2015,small
467,2017,"""Billi terminal"" is a hangar with 2 shops + the dutyfree, offering you a still bottle of water for 4.50 euros"
468,2018,Worst airport in France. Rude people and approximate cleanliness. It's always longer than needed to clear security check
469,2019,As a part of a disabled group we found that the special assistance at Bournemouth Bordeaux Airport was the worst I have come up against. They were so rude to someone of us. I have travelled a lot over the years and this experience at Bordeaux Airport has been the worst. Ordering us not asking us and would advise people in wheelchair's to avoid this airport if possible.
470,2020,"Pax guidance poor, crowded and hustle security feeling unsafe about your belongings. Just one bakery after the security. Wifi disconnected frequently."
471,2021,"The worst airport I have ever been: passengers have to wait on the street in 35 degrees celsius, without any roof, or protection. Than, the terminal buildung is very small, a joke, with no climate or ventillation. You can't sit down, because there are only a very limited number of chairs, eg. 100 for a lot of thousands. Facilities are also poor, as well as the wifi. The english knowledge is nearly non-existent in this airport, they only speak french. Security check is long and stupid, if you have your liquid in a transparent holder, they will throw it out, to put in the airport's """"dedicated"""" transparent holder, which is nearly the same, as yours. It's a shame, that this airport could exist in 2022 in the European Union."
472,2022,"A very small, and cramped airport. No services that I noticed past the security, except the duty free and vending machines. No lounges available, except 1 or 2 airline lounges. Horribly executed security lines."
473,2023,"Dirty, dirty, dirty..... Unfriendly people... Old facilities One of the worst french regional airports."
474,2024,"A terrible airport that has to be avoided! Only one toilet, only 2 places where you buy a sandwich or coffee; crowds of people waiting in queues, nervous staff, not enough seats for all at the gates, people sitting at the floor.I wonder how can France has such an airport?"
475,2025,"The Billi terminal is quite low-end... We were told that we were going to board at one gate then we were lied to, another gate was opened. As the first passengers, we found ourselves among the last... fucked up!"
476,2026,"I flew with easyJet so I had to sue the low cost terminal and it's really poor. Feels sheap with only the basic of facilities, a cafe with bland over priced food but the staff were nice at least. Waiting area is rubbish and the boarding process at the gate is poorly designed."
477,2030,"I find that they have overstated the size of this airport compared to a town of 115,000 inhabitants, moreover the journey to the other end of Brittany is not very pleasant, this airport welcomes too many low cost like ryanair"
478,2039,"Very poor airport. No facilities other than a small cafe before security. After security is just a small waiting area, a vending machine and one toilet with a queue the length of the departure lounge."
479,2040,"Nothing at all airside, just a vending machine. All car rental is now on the other side of a busy dual carriageway road, with an underpass and lifts that are out of action."
480,2045,"This airport is not great, the runway is 100 times too big for a town of only 44,000 inhabitants and what's more the local companies are really not great; Air France does not even offer a line to Chateauroux, plus the airport services are really bad"
481,2049,"This airport is not great, the runway is 100 times too big for a town of only 130,000 inhabitants and what's more the local companies are really not great. moreover clermont is not touristy at all"
482,2055,tiny tiny tiny airport.
483,2056,No public transport. The only SIX taxis in Dinard are a rip-off.
484,2060,"One of the worst airport experiences I've had. Far too many ski flights on a Saturday for the limited facilities. No queuing system, just carnage. Line for security through the centre of the main terminal, security could only be accessed after gate was called for flight, with only 4 lanes. Mens toilets were part way through replacing, leaving just a couple of cubicles for many thousands of customers."
485,2061,"Grenoble airport - perfect for weekday operations of 1 flight per day. Unfortunately, on a Saturday in winter, it receives closer to 20. Massive queues, large crowds, and a French ATC strike - what more could you want? Would recommend flying to GVA or Lyon instead."
486,2063,"If you are flying out from Grenoble airport during weekend in winter season and you expect departure to be hassle-free, think again! Grenoble airport is located close to French Alps so many people want to get to French Alps ASAP after landing. Arrival is relatively smooth but there will be always delay to departure as Grenoble airport is small airport and cannot handle huge number of passengers quickly. It took me 1 hour and 20 minutes to get to airside area from entry to check in area! Security area is small and only 3 lanes available for use with 2 other lanes under construction during busy time!!! Although I managed to get to airside area before boarding however all ten flights including mine that are scheduled to depart between 9 and 11:30am were delayed at least 30 minutes due to lots of missing passengers and it is because of over 1 hour and half long queue at check in and security area! I hope there will be big improvement to Grenoble airport so it can handle huge number of passengers during busy weekend for next winter season."
487,2064,"Small seasonal airport, would be really great if the staff was efficient : our flight had 40mins delay (it was 1/3 full...) due to the incompetence of the ground staff. The security was also so long with many trainees..."
488,2066,"it's a shame because the runway is big but there is barely one flight per day except in winter when the companies are present, but then the airport services are not there, I have one thing in conclusion, why do airports this big for one flight per day it's like chateauroux"
489,2068,"if you plan to fly to or from grenoble on a saturday be prepared for complete overcrowding and long waits. the airport is far to busy on winter saturdays due to all the ski flights, if at all possible avoid grenoble on saturdays."
490,2071,No cash withdrawal at the airport or around !!! Maybe time for some development there ;(
491,2074,"It's high time for an upgrade, it gets too crowded when all departures happen at the same time. The seating is not enough to accommodate everybody... Looking forward to expansion"
492,2075,"Dirty Crowded 15 minuts wifi (hey it is no more 1997 !) no lounge Saying ""it's africa!"" would be an insult for my african friends!"
493,2085,"Careful when leaving for a non schengen country. They have only 2 passports check points with 2 speeds, very slow and slug. And if there are 2 flights you will stay over on hour at the passport que. Horible experience"
494,2100,"Horrible airport, not even sure what positive aspect can even be mentioned. Chaotic, old, overcrowded, unfriendly staff in all areas, unorganized boarding, tiny and overcrowded lounge without windows and way to less bathrooms (that are dirty on top). In already was my 3rd time there, absolutely not recommendable."
495,2101,"Airport equivalent to an aerodrome, unworthy of the 2nd city of France: site to be razed and rebuilt."
496,2103,French border police sat there looking at the growing queue for a long time before letting anyone through. No sense of efficiency at all
497,2104,"I don’t know if the baggage staff was on strike or something, but I waited for an hour to get my luggage out, and all the passengers on the plane got angry."
498,2105,"Airport really not very busy, far from everything, not practical for access if you don't have your car there. Why don't we choose instead to develop flights to other French cities from Luxembourg? What is the point of having a loss-making airport in Lorraine?"
499,2106,"This airport is at least for strangers difficult to find, because of bad indicated directions and few street signs. The airport itself is not interesting, due to very limited flights. The destination and frequency network is inconvenient. In general, there are just few domestic destinations in France served. The infrastructure looks outdated and boring in many ways. The ticket prices for Hop by Air France, are by far to expensive. Jetairfly offers only some flights, for local Moroccan people living in Lorraine/Moselle to Morocco. Watch out: These are no tourist or holiday destinations. This is also the case for some seasonal flights to Algeria by air Algerie. Finally, you must be extremely flexible to find a flight from the middle of nowhere to almost nowhere. The location is far away from everything and everywhere. The region maybe needs the airport, but many passengers simply don´t need this poor airport."
500,2107,"To bad there are so few flights and it is poorly connected. Wanting to be close to Metz AND Nancy, it ended up in the middle of nowhere."
501,2108,"Airport essential to the economic development of the Lorraine region, accessible and on a human scale: to be preferred for your travels in mainland France."
502,2111,Bus from airport only once an hour? C'mon you french lazy suckers! Otherwise cozy and modern airport. Adding more toilets would be a great idea thou.
503,2115,"The airport overall is not bad, it's easy to reach it by public transportation, whilst by taxi is a little bit expensive. They have a really nice open lounge for smockers, not great food and retail service but more than acceptable. Actually, the prices inside the airport are not even that high as usual. The big problem, which really affects the overall grade, is that the free WiFi is for only 10 minutes! yes, 10 minutes, freaking unbelievable...but it just traces the french society. They are French and not German, nice people but still they tend to drown in an inch of water...it is not acceptable that an international airpot just gives you 10 minutes to surf the net. Just a little comparison: in Munich you have 24 hours..."
504,2116,Small and quite. A good airport for both small and large airlines.
505,2118,"Small airport with even smaller mentality. Not equipped for the current volumes and whilst easy to navigate, you can be caught in slow queues going through security. Airport needs more than just an upgrade!"
506,2119,"One of the worst airport in Europe. Facilities are old, always packed with people, no sitting space, it's always hot, no way to entertain kids, the food offer is very poor, security check pretty intense."
507,2120,"Too busy, not built to accommodate premium travelers and dated facilities including bathrooms that would probably not even be tolerated in prison!!!"
508,2121,"No lounge at the airport! Also, not that many options for food and you can't go through security before knowing the gate, which is displayed about 2h before the flight."
509,2122,"Luggage lost in Nantes on the way out: my suitcase did not even leave the airport. On return, wait 20 minutes before the first luggage appears on the conveyor belt. Always very long at this airport. Luggage service to be reviewed. Larger airports with more traffic have less trouble with suitcases. Waiting rooms not big enough"
510,2123,"Really small airport. Lounges are accessed before security. If you are flying in a smaller aircraft you will be boarded by bus, then you need to use the old hall which is poorly serviced"
511,2124,"Small airport, poorly designed. Baggage delivery can take a long time even if the number of passengers is not large. Rude security and immigration officers… Toilets not cleaned. No staff to guide you (or you risk running into an unpleasant agent…)! Looking forward to the redevelopment of this airport!"
512,2125,"Small and not very functional airport. People wait and queue in the middle of the hall. No staff is present to inform travelers. Toilets not cleaned, see “disgusting”. Friendly security staff but cold and disrespectful immigration officer."
513,2127,"Horrible service, all shops and restaurants were closed at 21:30 which is horrble, also the baggage drops was delayed by an HOUR because of the french"
514,2130,"This airport is the worst in Europe. Even though security was smooth, the boarding experience was the worst I have seen on any flight. Four flights, including ours were boarding from two gates in the small rest-stop like area. There were no buses, which we had to wait for 30min to get after which roughly 150 people were crammed onto. Staff were unhelpful, unfriendly and any concerns will not be handled very well."
515,2138,"The absolute worst airport I’ve ever been in (I’ve been in 30). There is so much useless staff they can’t even justify their purpose. They check the ticket 5 times before getting to the gate - not an exaggeration, literally I counted 5 times. Most of the staff doesn’t speak more than 2 words in English. Only 2 working border control desks for the whole terminal. Not to mention the whole airport is one cheap hangar with minimal improvements. Though they claim it’s a Paris airport, it’s very far away and it is very poorly connected to the city, even to the Beauvais train station."
516,2139,"Please, do not buy coffee in only bistro located after security-check - if you do not want stomach issues during flight :) - they do not clean cafe machine at all (when you ask them when they cleaned it last time - staff pretends they do not speak English :D )"
517,2140,"What is this airport without a waiting room, you wait standing and not a crazy choice for a drink or a bite to eat"
518,2141,This airport had one cafe and a shop. We take a bus from paris that goes directly to the airport. 1and half hour.
519,2143,"Dirty toilets, rude security staff, overall the airport is too small to handle the growth. Definitely wouldn’t be flying there again"
520,2144,"Very small and basic airport, far away from the city. On arrival we had wait essentially in a tent and on the return flight the border control held up basically all the flights and it was a chaos, the flights were delayed, and people had to stand in the que for hours. My worst airport experience, ever."
521,2145,"The worst airport I have ever been to. Very small, non-existent services and very dated structure. The staff at the controls are not at all courteous."
522,2146,The passport control area is optional on flights to Bulgaria; they've also forgot to stamp my passport until I reminded it
523,2147,"It's just a large garage or hall. Inside a few benches and a cafe. It's hard to call it an airport, even Walmart has better halls than those barracks at Beauvious. Ticket control is a pain in the a*s, they have a problem with everything, what passanger have"
524,2153,"If this is the airport for the Olympics they are in bad shape. Check-in is slow and there are no drop-off desks. At security checks you still have to take everything out, having to use a minimum of 3 baskets. Very few screens spelling out the gates. A disabled person had to go to the aircraft unaccompanied. And 45' for boarding, blocking everything to make 4 luggage labels to send to the hold. If I return to Paris it will be in 2025"
525,2179,Awful rundown airport with disinterested staff who work at a Glacial pace. Check in was an utter joke as desks did not send problem passengers to one side.
526,2184,This airport has a new terminal. Really beautiful and welcoming !!!
527,2185,"Airport has few facilities, and no bus service, and rip-off prices from the few taxis in the town (Rodez Town itself is nice)."
528,2189,"No problem getting to the airport from Strasbourg. 8min trip on the train then a short walk from the station to the terminal building. Checking was no issue (no hold luggage so no need to check in) Security was a bit of a hassle as they wanted to spend extra time looking at the cameras we had. Only a very small handful of toilets, but maintained well. No wifi at all. Only 1 eatery post-security, very expensive. Not enough seating! Especially as all passengers on the flight were rushed to the gate only to have to wait an extra half hour as the aircraft was running late (departed late from Stansted) and hand't even arrived by the time we were called to the gate. Staff didn't inform us of the delay, passengers had to ask."
529,2190,"Very friendly airport, which deserves to be known: low cost (Ryanair, Volotea and Vueling rub shoulders with Air France, Hop! to allow all travelers to choose their company for diverse and varied destinations."
530,2192,Good Airport in progress
531,2193,very dirty Airport
532,2204,"Arriving to the new part of the airport, which is bad designed. After desembarquing the aircraft, an then entering to the airport 'building' in fact it is an open area. It was a windy rainny day, therefore it was not pleasant, and furthermore, it was dangerous due to the water on the floor."
533,2206,"Toulouse's airport is a good airport but the staffs are quickly overwhelmed by the events. A road had been built up to drop the passengers close to the check in boxes. After the ouverture of te road, it has been closed a few days later. It cost a lot of money for nothing. And inside the airport, it always smells badly. I DO not know why."
534,2217,A tregedy. Worst intercon airport ever visited. No early check in. No AC Worst toilettes ever found Boarding process managed without any logic
535,2218,"Terrible airport, 30 minutes of free Wi-Fi per month. They do not answer the email for queries, French Polynesia is expensive in itself but this airport is an abuse. We had damaged luggage and the solution was to pack it, but the business was closed (even though there were 3 international flights being checked + domestic ones). Unfortunately “you have to think” that you are on vacation to avoid stress."
536,2219,"Mostly expected for a small airport, but needs air conditioning in the international departures area."
537,2227,"About as basic as they come. Getting to the airport is great as its so close to the town centre. Every flight requires you to check in normally rather than use mobile boarding passes, so this just wastes unnecessary time. Security just as slow, and there isn't much to offer in terms of food and drink at the airport."
538,2228,nice airport for a small city.
539,2229,Cute little cozy airport with nice service. Grazie Batumi!
540,2230,"Cool, but very long queues. Hopefully with more flights more staff will be engaged. Had to stand 90 minutes in queues."
541,2242,Don't have an idea about security check regulations and even when You showed them their own rules - don't react.
542,2245,"No drinking water taps, no self check-in and no online check-in possibility. Many places to charge phones. Expensive food, poor choice of shops."
543,2252,World's slowest airbridge operators by far hired by BER ... wondering how that is different as this just rightly suck ...
544,2254,"The security check messed up my entire departure procedure. I planned plenty of time (2hrs earlier to departure time) and I barely made it to my gate in time. For much of the delay, the airport cannot be held responsible as many fellow passengers didn't pack their hand luggage the right way (e.g. way too many liquids, liquids not in a transparent bag...). But the overall management of those cases was horrible. Each and every container was discussed separately. This is why it took me more than 1.5hrs to get through security. That's a no-go. During the time from bag drop to boarding, the gate changed a total of three times. Even when all passengers were lined up at the gate, they changed it one more time to a gate on another level. No good visit this time at BER..."
545,2255,"This airport is a joke. Queue to check in, even though we had done online check in and had boarding cards. Security is so slow it is unbelievible (we arrived 2 hours early and only just made our flight). Only 1 gate check in agent who was taking cabin bags off people to check them into the hold (we had been warned this would happen, but still people turn up with cabin bags that need to be then processed, thus slowing down loading time). Needless to say we missed our departure slot and had to wait on the ground for 30 minutes, so all those people who thought they were saving themselves time at Heathrow, got the double whammy of a delayed departure and still having to go to baggage reclaim."
546,2256,"So much for German efficiency, this airport is the principle airport of a major European city, however it feels more likes a regional airport that is grossly understaffed."
547,2264,"Waiting for the checkin was a pain. Very crowded even if you are on the counter soon. They told us NOT to wait in line until a certain time because they are processing another flight first. But that led to chaos with newcomers for our flight, standing in line before us even if we where there sooner. Security check was taking a long time, because a lot of flights are taking place during a specific time. Very crowded for a small airport like that."
548,2271,"There were only two passport officers on duty at BRE, which made things VERY slow exiting the airport."
549,2272,"Was there during snow storm, horribly mismanaged place. Our flight was delayed over 7 hours. They boarded us at one point onto buses, then left us waiting on them for over an hour in the freezing cold, only to drop us off back at the terminal with no explanation. There was no staff to help. We left at 3 am, they did not offer any help during this whole time."
550,2273,"There are no water fountains at this airport. Cafes refuse to serve tap water. Some flight announcements are only made in English. Rubbish food services is certain parts, which also close at 20:00 or earlier. Not functional playing areas. Very slow security control."
551,2274,Passport control over an hour to get through. Was in the queue for longer than we were in the air for a flight from London!
552,2275,Waiting time at the baggage claim was 90 minutes after landing. That is really too much for an airport with that size.
553,2278,"I had an unpleasant experience with this airport in May. The plan was to have a 1.5-hour layover in my travel from LHR to a city in Schengen area. The airport does not seem to be designed for connecting flights. The path to my departure gate was through arrivals/baggage claim and then I had to join a horrendous queue to security check (the same queue also for those who start their journey at CGN). I tried to find out if I there was a fast track, but it turned out that you had to book it online 12 hours in advance… People who managed the flow of the line to security were either extremely rude or pretended not to speak a word in English. I am just happy that Eurowings waited almost 20 minutes post declared gate closing time and I still managed to catch my connecting flight."
554,2279,"Hard to find directions for connecting flights, so this might lead to people wandering around without finding where to go"
555,2280,"Worst airport ever, staff shortage in summer, 5h queue to go through the security check. At least half of the passagers couldn’t make it to the aircraft due to a poor organisation. The only thing I can hope for is a group action to make the airport pay for all the holidays they ruined. They are 100% responsible for this absolute chaos due to their lack of anticipation and organisation."
556,2281,"Huge queues for check in, security and passports due to staff shortages on a large scale. It took us two and a half hours just to get through check ins and security, then a further 20 odd minutes at passports. This all being (allegedly) due to staff shortages through gross inefficiency on the part of the airport authorities. This is endemic throughout the German aviation industry, so I won't be going back there anytime soon...."
557,2283,"The worst airport I've ever been. Very small, cramped, no air condition (very hot inside). Only one small shop and bar. There's no to do here. I was very bored. Staff delays flights in an empty airport. Ground handling takes over an hour"
558,2284,"The airport has almost no retail after (or even before security) whatsoever. Just one Heinemann (which was closed), one shop outside of security and one bistro inside. No seating - for 1 gate 9 seats in total - like WTF?"
559,2285,"Parking is way too expensive for this airport, even shuttles from parking lot to terminal have to be paid. The Shuttle Bus to Dortmund Main Railway Staion can not be used with regular local tickets and also needs to be paid extra... Foot courts are closed in the evening, no drinking water fountains available."
560,2288,Utter crap. Parking expensive. Charging for a 1 minute bus transfer to the terminal. Poor a facilites.
561,2293,unfortunately was my luggage still in Frankfurt but it was fast delivered to my home the same evening
562,2294,"Most shops were closed, refreshments close at 4 p.m. After check-in, there are already two vending machines that were both broken."
563,2301,Nice and small airport! But very slow at luggage.
564,2302,Not enough seating space at the gates. Our gate had 20 seats for a full A320... Washrooms were simply the most dirty ones I've seen in years.
565,2303,As usual airport understaffed. Security lines take forever not because there is too much people but because they open only 1 or 2 in places when they can open up to 5. Bathrooms dirty and smelly.
566,2304,First waiting on the plane because the bus to take us to the terminal wasn´t there. Then waiting for the luggage because there are not enough workers to do that timely even if there were only the last few flights arriving at that time. Overall almost 2hs delay after arriving. This airport always shows such a big lack of manpower. Bathrooms dirty and smelly.
567,2313,"Not much flies from Erfurt-Weimar airport anymore. Since Lufthansa began offering ExpressRai connections from Erfurt main station (XIU), Erfurt has once again become part of the international scheduled flight network. Very comfortable and very useful."
568,2318,Absolute Chaos as always. This airport grew and was never generally reconstructed. Just added here an there a few stuff. Baggage claim took ages (around 45 minutes) until they started service.
569,2319,Absolute Chaos as always. This airport grew and was never generally reconstructed. Just added here an there.
570,2321,"Don't like the Siko in front of the gates. Super slow.. Lounge JAL isn't great either. No buffet, must be ordered and very small portions. At least with toilet/shower"
571,2324,big airport too big. Nothing to do. Wi-fi sucks has horrible range. The only good thing is the good food
572,2325,you have to walk a lot to get to a flight and nothing there to do. Wi-Fi had horrible range. Food was good though
573,2328,"The security check took an extremely long time, the line almost went all the way to the Ryanair check-in counter. In total, we stood in line for well over an hour, and in the end the passengers on our flight were brought forward."
574,2329,"One of the worst German airports - no public transport, horrible organisation and no further services."
575,2330,"The worst airport in the world. The most common warehouse that has 0 content, 0 good restaurants or shops. Huge crowds, long queues, lack of employees... in one word, DISASTER"
576,2333,"duty-free before passport control, inspection is specific, queues, the airport is small"
577,2343,The security checkpoint at Hamburg Airport is still clearly number 1 as the unfriendly security checkpoint in the world. Sometimes you barely speak German (you can live with it if necessary); then sometimes completely disinterested because they are engrossed in conversation or have to read their cell phone; Then you get yelled at because something should be done or nothing should be done. School grade 6 / Set
578,2344,"The area of gate A39 at Hamburg Airport, along with the adjacent gates, was a disaster. The walking distance there is long and unattractive, the gate area is extremely crowded, and the signage contradicts itself both manually and digitally. The path to the aircraft was across the apron, which is exciting, but there was a line on the gangway, so we had to wait in the rain."
579,2345,"Horrible airport, very unorganised, almost missed my flight the security people don't care honestly hate this airport"
580,2351,"We arrived and there was no ground handling equipment ready for us (stairs and bus as we had a remote position). Also in my opinion the S1 should leave at least each 10 minutes, I think it was each 20 minutes that Sunday..."
581,2354,"Security Check was extremely slow and annoying. The rest of the airport is very nice, small, comfortable."
582,2355,Dramatic organisation with check-in as well with security - long waiting time. Worst european airport in my opinion
583,2357,"Absolutely horrible airport management. The queue for the check in and security control was all in all more than 4h long, and the staff was disrespectful."
584,2358,"Truly a lousy airport, check in was very slow end had an attitude. Due to travelling to a non schengen country, we went through security, but on the other side was nothing open unless you wanted to buy dutyfree. The cafe was closed, the vending machines was not working. It was 8 o´clock in the evening and there was four planes departing non schengen, so lots of people and no seats in the gate. Dissaster!!"
585,2359,Hardly any facilities. Literally nothing once you have moved to the gate. Very confusing layout (separate security scanners for each set of gates)
586,2372,GAT
587,2374,"One of the worst airports in Germany. Understaffed (especially on passport control - 1 open counter for 200+ flight from Russia, that just arrived, is a complete joke and disaster), no wi-fi, no restaurants, 1 working ATM that doesn't really work, shops that don't allow you to pay by card if you buy something cheaper than 5 euro, bus ticket machine that accepts only cash... The list continues."

590,2382,"Theres no Rail station, no ""Autobahn"" only normal streets!!! You must travel about 1 hour throu Kassel. A lot of traffic and always red traffic-lights. That's no fun!! No WIFI on this small new airport. Incredible GSM and so on. Bad Airport."
591,2390,"Badly structured airport, relativly long walking distances for such a small airport and unfriendly staff. This airport does not even have wifi...."
592,2400,"small airport, short ways, friendly staff - like it!"
593,2401,to small...the Gate are a tent!
594,2402,terminal is just a tent and is unprofessional in service
595,2403,Way too small for the amount of flights/traffic it has. You constantly feel cramped and the air inside the terminal/lounge is barely breathable. Food services are also very disappointing.
596,2405,"A small, third world airport, lines at the security gate. Dirty bathrooms smell disgusting."
597,2408,AVOID at all costs - This Airport is a disaster. They schedule 9 flights at similar times so the queue will extend out the door as well as your chance of catching your flight if you arrive less than 2 hours before. The airport says that the airlines advise 3 hours! They park the aircraft remotely as there isn't enough space and board passengers by bus. The bus leaves the gate at 20 minutes before scheduled departure even if people are waiting to board. If you get down the stairs 19 minutes before the flight they threaten to call the police if you don't leave!
598,2409,"An airport that open between 4:20-5 am(LOCAL TIME), really small, have a good free wifi, have no lounges. only few check in station that leads to huge queues. On flights to Israel, the duty-free closed for flying to Israel, as well as there is only 2 booths of passport control, 1 coffee shop, 1 toilets, and really small place to a lot of people, approximately 150-200 people in such a small place. there are only few scan system for flying to Israel, so there are big queues. There isn't a bus to get to the airport, your only option is rent a car or order taxi."
599,2410,It is a little airport but you need a lot more time than on any of the big ones. It took me over 1 hour to drop of my luggage.
600,2417,"Coordination during snow times or rail strike was --- catastrophe. E.g.: After a 50 minutes flight i had to wait 80 minutes for luggage ... Deicing capacity too low - we sat for 3 hours in plane before we could roll to de-icing ... MUC, your good times are gone ..."
601,2418,"Unfortunately, due to snowfall, the onward flight to Paderborn was canceled. Total chaos at the airport. 150 flights were canceled. There was only one runway available."
602,2420,"Absolutely SHIT!!! Arrived at T2 K,L,M and had to go to G. Pointless security check. FOR WHAT REASON !!!! No lounge visit, pure stress, just one minute to catch our plane to FRA. THAT WAS A CRAP!!!"
603,2422,"The baggage loading workers decided it's the end of their shift and zero luggage was loaded into the airplane, which resulted in 200 passengers landing without their clothes, medicine and valuables."
604,2428,"Constantly crowded and long queues at security and Check-In. No online check-in supported, no wate refill facilities, no structured boarding. Boarding started even before the aircraft was ready, leading to a long waiting time standing in the air bridge."
605,2434,"I missed my flight, which is obviously my fault, but there were several factors that didn't help: - I needed to check in a child seat at Customer Service desk, this took an awful lot of time (~5-10 min?) - all airports I had previously flown from allowed a child pram to be taken all the way to the plane door. This was not the case here, I had to leave it at the oversize luggage desk - people at the security saw my boarding pass and didn't say anything about the gate closing in a few minutes, they didn't offer a fast track - normally departure screens show ""LAST CALL"" or similar when the gate is closing. In Nurnberg, this was a green ""BOARDING"" even 10 minutes after the gate was closed - apparently I was called, but this was not clear/loud enough Overall, a very negative experience."
606,2443,"Flights are constantly canceled due to fog!!! The choice to build an airport on the crest of a hill that seems to almost magically attract clouds and to only fly there by sight, on a shortened runway, seems like a prank to me, at least in the winter months. There are also only daily flights to Hamburg and Betlin. This is not an airport, but a subsidy business. As a regular commuter to Berlin, I am happy for every day that Air Berlin still flies!"
607,2451,"Poor experience, flight was moved from T3 to T4. Very long lines in T4 and absolutely NO shops or restaurants, neither before or after security."
608,2452,"Disastrous airport with no lounges, overcrowded, poorly organized, not recommended, should be avoided if possible!"
609,2463,"The airport is perfectly suited to people from the local area as it gives them links to holiday destinations and other cities without the need to travel to one of the major airports in the area. However, most non-Germans flying in to Weeze are unlikely to have Weeze or its local surrounding areas as their final destination. Beware that, despite the excellent rail network in Germany, travel to any of the major cities in the area will take some time. Don't forget to add this on to the flights costs as it may make the low Ryanair costs seem less attractive."
610,2464,Terrible airport with terrible transportation. It has been the worst airport I have been in my entire life.
611,2472,Best in the country by far. I’m really looking forward to better services. We’re in the modern world we need more digitizations.
612,2474,"Well, very slow airport. Check-in procedure is quite eaay and normal speed but then security, boarding, lugguage claim, passport control is not at all easy. Specially in evrning flights, there are a lot of queu. Do not forget to bring your yellow fever vaccination card with you as it may be requiered"
613,2477,Very fast luggage handling
614,2484,"Nice new airport...cost dont know how much....kind of white elephant. Good job its not busy as immigration (passport control) not capable f handling more than one flight at a time ..... ""International Airport"" only flies to U.K."
615,2487,Nice new terminal. Old one is horrid.
616,2488,Runway crossed by a motorway.... Small but nice hub
617,2495,"When I was there, we departed at night about 11 pm. It was opened only one duty free shop with food. Food was very expensive. (one packet of biscuits - 10 EURO). Facilities was very clean. Crew at the check-in have problems with my surname. They can't wrote it."
618,2499,"We waited for 90 mins for our baggage, all the flights from Aegean, while in the same belt baggages from international flights were receiving upon arrival....."
619,2500,A modern airport that asks people to get out of arrivals and go up into departures and re-checkin in order to travel from intra to extra schengen. Additional passport gates are required so you can go directly to the gate without having to get outside.
620,2507,"Although everything was going quite efficiently, the staff at the airport had some racist behaviour. Being a platinum member of Air France KLM I am awarde skypriority privilege. For some unknown reason (I was dressed in jeans + pullover, so nothing out of the ordinary), yet I was asked a dozen times if I was shure that I had SkyPriority. I was even told once that my status would be checked later on so I better be shure I am indeed awarded SkyPriority. At the gate the gateagent takes my passport, takes my boarding pass to then ask me again if I am zone 1 or 2... 1 star for the efficient process then nothing extra because of this behaviour. Furthermore the Golden Air Lounge was way too crowded and the crew was quite rude and impolite"
621,2508,Check-in person was missing about 15 minutes while all other lines were ok. Airport personnel let us out to the airfield while other plane B737 was taxiing in front of us. Dangerous situation and VERY loud!
622,2514,"Really rude staff on the airport, when checking in does not listen. Posters about social distancing everywhere, but the terminal building was full with passengers and social distancing was impossible. When boarding the flight the staff of the airport were really unprofessional and rude, with no greetings and really unhelpful."
623,2521,"You need a lot of imagination in order to imagine an airport that is worse. Absolutely overcrowded, not ventilated, no lounge, old and pregnant people standing around as sitting is limited, no drinking water - only in the limited amount of stores. The entire place is dirty. Well, it is an airport and the only one on Corfu - so no matter how shitty it is, we are coming back - and the management clearly understands this."
624,2524,Terrible airport. Such long queues in security that airport personnel have to call out for people on imminent flights to move to the front which annoys everyone else. Same situation at passport control.
625,2525,Horrible airport like other in Greece. Very small and weird. Flight to Prague was operated on national check in. The shops are very overpriced (like on every airport). Hope that the reconstruction will be done soon :)
626,2526,"More or less the worst airport ever. We came to the airport 2h10m before our departure, and it was just one person handling the check-in for a full a321. They are building a new terminal, which I sincerely hope will cope with the capacity during peak season."
627,2527,"Nightmare. 2 h waiting for check-in, then 200m queue for security. When we heard final call they allowed us to go to security immediatelly."
628,2528,Very crowded during summer season.Terminal was built in the seventies and it seems as if nothing was modernized till today. Fast baggage claim.
629,2529,"The worst airport I have ever been. Too(extremely) crouded in peak season. Women on checkin laziest person I have ever seen too. After check in, we had to carry baggage elsewhere for rentgen check. Ater that, we had to overtake security check line, if we didnt wana miss flight. A lot of complains from other ppl, who were waiting in that line, while we overtaking them."
630,2531,Very dated airport with limited facilities and terribly small duty free. Border control very efficient yet baggage claim was lacking with fellow passengers waiting an hour for their luggage to be deboarded
631,2532,"The baggage claim is a joke. Multiple flights go together to same belt, the luggages are being thrown on top of each other. There is way to many people and flights and not enough belts. Looks hectic."
632,2533,"Very small airport, WiFi is non-existent, too much flights, too much chaos at the airport. You can't find any seats there, because they are full, so you need to stand! This is the worst airport in Europe I've ever seen!"
633,2534,"Airport is too small to accommodate the amount of flights. Not all area had Aircon and if it had, it was not sufficient. There are no self-service facilities and all checked-in luggage had to be manually submitted at the counters. Security was fine, equipped with your standard x-ray and metal detector. The queue for the security check depends on the time of your arrival. At the gates, there were too little chairs for the amount of waiting passengers. There is another waiting room at the 1st floor which was less crowded and much cooler than in the main floor where all the gates are."
634,2537,"This is the worst airport in Europe I've ever seen! Chaos, chaos and more chaos. The main problem is that the terminal building is too small for the volume of people they are processing and there is a minimal organisation (like quing lines). Difficult to move, minimal amount of seats, pregnant women sitting on the floor etc."
635,2538,"Catastrophic & overcrowded airport. ""Millions"" of people in a tiny small departure hall, announcments introduced by a massiv beep every couple of seconds, gate changes, etc. Never experienced such an unorganiced an overcrowded airport in africa, asia or elsewhere in the world...."
636,2545,"the security check is a joke (one person, I didn't take out any liquids, for example) although it was super fast; check-in began at the time of scheduled departure; bus ride 50m; check-in at the AMS counter (departed a moment earlier)"
637,2548,"It is a small airport with no flights during a day at all. When you go through security check, you only have 2 shops over there, so it can be a bit boring. Toilets were clean. WiFi didn't work."
638,2549,very small and you have a feeling of getting away from this airport. also very big latency
639,2552,Lovely island but the airport is very small. Security checks are usually very quick once you're at the desk but the queues take a while as there are only 2 of them. Security officers can also come across as very cold/rude (much like Greek police). Don't except to find any food or duty-free either as that is only for departures. Luckily baggage claim is very quick due to the small airport size.
640,2553,Lovely island but the airport is very small. Security checks are usually very quick once you're at the desk but the queues take a while as there are only 2 of them.

Luckily baggage claim is very quick due to the small airport size.
641,2554,Lovely island but the airport is very small. Not very efficient check-in so expect to be waiting a while. Security check tends to be very quick however. It's not usually super busy as there aren't many flights there daily but the departure hall can get crowded quickly since all 4 gates use the same hall. Very limited food options and only one small duty free gift shop; I hope you like sandwiches.
642,2558,"The worst airport in Greece, i think. Only one security check and very small departure hall for 4 gates. People were sitting on the floor, because there werent many bench. And also only two shops."
643,2559,"Firstly I will say. The staff were excellent. FRAport clearly know they have a space problem so throw staff at it to direct people and ease flow through the building. They were incredibly polite and friendly. Kefalonia is a very small airport. If you can help it, stay landside as long as possible. Only head through security when you have to. The departure lounge is incredibly small. The size of one gate at a larger airport. It is incredibly cramped. Seating all full. A lot of people standing up against the wall and even in open space. There is a coffee/bar counter and a duty free shop. The boarding of the flights is a bit chaotic too. One ramp down to the apron. Two flights of pax actually got queued down either side of this small ramp. The upside is that a terminal extension appears to be in progress. This beautiful island will only see growth so hopefully the currently stretched airport can cope in future high seasons. Lounge 1 star - It's tiny, cramped and uncomfortable. Food & retail services 2 star - Only one counter on either side but food & drink selection was good. Security 3 stars - staff were helpful, process was easy but again too cramped. Terminal facilities 1 star - Not a lot going on in terms of facilities. Getting to the airport 3 stars - Bus & taxis available but it is at the end of a small road."
644,2565,Extremely outdated airport at this time. The airport is undergoing a major reconstruction to be finished in 2020.
645,2566,"Very small airport, all flights go through the same custom area. Not very much to do and very crowded and hot inside"
646,2568,"The airport's crowded, queues everywhere. Incomprehensible messages (too loud or too quiet). There is no place to sit. The worst of all airports so far."
647,2569,"Chaotic airport! Currently under renovation. Long lines everywhere. Even if employees try to bring order out of chaos, you're happy when you're finally on the plane."
648,2572,"Kos Airport is a horrible airport to fly through. The lack of space, uncleanliness and lack of facilities is terrible. It’s packed full of holidaymakers, and there is no where that you can get proper food. Would definitely reccommend that anyone going through the airport is prepared for an awful experience."
649,2576,"Basic airport, definitely requiring some upgrades, especially if you count the profile of the island and the number of the travelers."
650,2577,"Tiny, crowded airport. Incredible that at check-in they do not have a luggage belt and we, the passengers, have to carry them to the control"
651,2578,"Small and chaotic airport with inadequate facilities for so many flights during the summer season. Long queues everywhere (check-in, x-ray control of the luggage, security check, boarding, ...). Very late and slow luggage loading into the plane."
652,2579,Very small airport with very few facilities. We had to wait 20 minutes after check-in to leave the baggages. Boarding very smooth but with no priority procedures for families. Car-rental available. Duty free shop on the first floor with traditional greek products and fair prices. Snack bar inside the terminal is very expensive.
653,2580,Outdated
654,2586,"A very small airport with basic facilities. It is old but clean! For me it was fun during November, but I imagine there are problems during the summer with many people there."
655,2587,land in the side of the sea
656,2588,small but cool
657,2591,"Very little airport, with basically nowhere to eat. Few bus schedules to/from downtown Paroikia. Definitely in need of an expansion."
658,2594,"a nice ""family"" airport"
659,2598,Overcrowded and understaffed airport with enormous queues in duty free shops. It was very hot while waiting in line for security check. Probably during high season it`s like that every day.
660,2600,"Passport control was a long queue and not very fast, took about 40 minutes to get to bag claim then onto the transfer."
661,2605,"Very crowded, had to wait for 1h+ due to morning jam. Staff was not friendly. Outside the terminal, a lot of busses were driving around, a total mess."
662,2607,"Very small airport, but good"
663,2610,One of the worst organised airports. Staff friendly but that's about it. Too small for the number of flights and capacity.
664,2611,"I love the island, however the airport is pretty bad (to say it nicely). Over crowded, no lockers, bad connections (bus once an hour, but the price is good) .. at least there is free wifi"
665,2616,"It is a significant small airport. It cannot serve even a smaller plane like 737/320 well. The lounge is simply too small, all the toilets are broken or not in service, extremely limited food and retail services, no WiFi. Things went even worse with the Ryanair, passport check and cabin baggage check halfed the insufficient space, made it more crowded."
666,2617,"This is by far the worst airport I've ever visited. Avoid at all cost. Not one thing actually worked here. The staff was rude and the airport has like 100 times the number of passengers per day that the airport staff and facilities can handle. We got delayed on the way there by roughly 2h, and when we we went back from there, the delay was up to 3h."
667,2618,"Greece, the birthplace of Mathematics ;) Lets think now, we have over 1,000,000 visitors to Santorini each year, how big an airport will we need? I don't know, maybe a small building with no air con and no wifi or 4G even though you can get it everywhere else on the island. Hey that sounds like a plan. If we have too many planes at once or delays, people can always queue up outside the building. Yeah sounds great :) What about baggage? I know we'll check people in and then get them to carry their own bag to the X-Ray machine. No point spending money an a conveyor system. Ha ha what, other airports have them? Losers!! We'll need to get the passengers from the building to the aircraft - how many buses do you think we'll need? I don't know do you think one will be enough? Nah lets push the boat out and buy two - job done. With all these passengers do you think we'll need seats for them to sit on and toilets and stuff like that? Yeah, but don't blow the budget. Maybe two toilets and a couple of hundred seats, tops."
668,2619,"The airport is just horrible. The check in is really slow and there's no space. They don't even take your checked baggage! They weigh it, and you have to take it to the security check personally. Then you pass through safety, and you find yourself in a really crowded mini terminal. You won't find a place to sit, there are only a few benches, always busy. There are absolutely no facilities. The toilets stink really bad. They delay flights because they just can't make it on time, they're really inefficient. There's no wifi in the airport."
669,2623,"As expected in the Greek islands, this tiny airport doesn't have much to offer. It's a bare bones airport. The only note about getting to/from the airport is you may need to plan to take a ferry the day before you depart from Skiathos if you are staying on a different island, like Skopelos. You can easily get a taxi at the airport that goes to/from the port."
670,2641,"Everything is taking so long in this airport. The staff at the check in desk was moving very slow. Queue at the check in, queue at the security control, where everything was chaotic. Poor organisation from the staff in this airport. Be sure to arrive in time for all the procedures cause otherwise you’ll miss your flight. The bathrooms were also dirty and the floor was slippery. Not to mention that the check in area stinks. Stinks so bad that you can feel it even through the mask!"
671,2653,"In a pandemic situation all operations are kinda different from usual time. The airport could have been much more friendly with some natural flowers and a better organization, lack of food area. ( very limited), toilets not always clean. But overall ok."
672,2661,"Cozy airport, took ages to clear immigration. Airport access was easy, hotel buses were right outside."
673,2663,if you rent with toyota/ace make sure to drop your car 2h before departure. they take forever to process you and their shuttle bus only rides every half hour
674,2666,"This airport could not be more of a PITA. I love latin america, but this is too much. There's 10 family members for every 1 person departing or arriving. Making a connection was impossible because the transit area was closed. So I spent an hour in customs just to finally be spit out into baggage claim, I had no bags, but had to wait in line another 20 minutes to exit the baggage hall. Then you gotta pass through the hoards of people waiting for family outside. It's sweet, but also pretty ridiculous. There's no way to get back upstairs for departures, except to go through the parkade...where neither elevator was in service. Back up there to check in, only to go BACK through exit immigration and filling out the same paper form for the second time in 2 hours. Hot as hell in there for the most part too. There's wifi in the terminal and it's not terrible, I'll give them that, but the rest of the terminal is pretty dreadful. At midnight, you'd expect the place to be dead, except that's when ALL the US flights depart. So despite the fact that there were flights to IAH/JFK/LAX/EWR/MIA all within about the span of about 3 hours, most of the places were closed."
675,2673,Impossible to get to the airport by public transport if your flight is late or early in the morning. There is a passport control as soon as you enter. Nobody can fire you. At dawn it is dark and closed
676,2699,"The next day's flight was changed to one without lounge access the day before. Luckily, the connecting flight was canceled and I received another endos, so I ignored it and they sent it to me just this once."
677,2716,"One of the worst airport experiences I had was right here. The personnel is so rude, it's disappointing. Airport itself is decent, but the people working here make it disgusting. Getting here was quite straightforward, a taxi from the city center to the airport was around 25 euros and a 30-40 minute drive depending on the time of day."
678,2717,"Visited quite a few airports in Europe, but the only worse experience than in the Budapest airport is the one in Vienna. The airport looks nice, and is pretty modern, however, the staff working here are one of the most unpleasant people I have came across. While I do understand policies and procedures, they go above and beyond to make your day miserable and stress you out without any reason. Namely, I had bought a Hungarian palinka that I wanted to bring home, and upon security check they labeled my bag as suspicious and one woman rudely and with force started opening my backpack. Made me feel like a criminal while yelling at me how it is forbidden to bring more than 1000 ml of fluids. I, at no point had more than 1000ml of fluids, and the Palinka bottle itself was 100ml. Also, I had a type of thick yoghurt that in no way is a fluid, and that also was an issue for her. She demanded that I either eat the yoghurt and DRINK THE PALINKA on spot, or throw them away. Of course, I ate my yoghurt and threw away the Palinka. I couldn't even believe she suggested for me to down an alcoholic drink right before a flight. As mentioned, I do understand the rules and why they are in place, but forcing people to throw away stuff that is in no way against these policies is just wrong. I have travelled by plane many, many times and most of the times I had the same yoghurt with me and no one said anything against it. Many times I bought drinks from other countries, not exceeding the limit for fluids, and no one found any issue with it. This only casts a long shadow on the Hungarians. They do not appreciate their local products, and apparently do not support tourists doing them a free promotion by bringing their culture into their own countries."
679,2720,"Teeny-tiny airport. Even if you don't have checked-in luggage we had to queue at the check-in desk. Very few flights/day so very limited facilities, one food shop. No water fountains. Google maps takes one to the wrong airport entrance."
680,2721,"Seemingly excessive security checks. A member of the family in front of us was asked to take off his slippers (normal cross-threaded slippers) and go through the X-ray. I've experienced something similar before. A slightly humiliating and hygienically not very safe procedure. Note that this is not LAX or Heathrow! It is understandable that there are safety regulations and rules that serve the safety of the passengers and the flight, but in my opinion, they are either overthinking them or making their own rules, I can't decide. With a few of these tricks, you can pretty much ruin the first day of your vacation."
681,2722,"Seemingly unjustified check on arrival. During Covid, they gathered the passengers of the plane before the passport check, not even paying attention to the social distancing rules. Behind the photocell door 2 meters away, 2 police officers asked for the documents of each passenger (including any vaccination certificate, but the social distancing rules were ignored. ), and 3 meters away they again asked for the documents of each passenger to enter the country. I can't understand why passengers on typical ""holiday"" flights have to be vetted."
682,2723,"Very basic regional airport. Check-in opens 2 hours before departure. With only a handful of flights per day, the terminal has minimal staffing which means that when a flight does depart there is little space for anyone to queue or sit down, especially when a flight is delayed which results in two flights leaving at the same time as in our case. The only pre-security seating is outside and there is only vending machines. Post-security there are two tiny cafes which are very expensive and have limited food. Would recommend eating before you arrive at the airport to depart or on the plane."
683,2724,"Just a slightly large family house with no pedestrian access. Only has two gates. There are no screens at the airport, everything printed on a piece of paper. Hostile security staff."
684,2725,"The bus from the center runs infrequently (interval of 2 or more hours). So far my most thorough check (checking the hem of the pants, wiping and socks, the need to turn on the laptop,...). The waiting room before boarding is small (for about 120 people) and there is one shop with alcohol and cigarettes. One shop with drinks, small snacks and cookies. Prices are twice as expensive as in the center of Debrecen."
685,2726,This is the small but very good and clean airport in my city which better and better!:)
686,2727,"My favourit airport.Small, but nice and cleane"
687,2729,"I know this is small regional airport, but the attitude of the employees who think we do not understand Hungarian is ridiculous, chatting about the travelers that they are bothering them flying here and they have to be on the airport and working on Saturday etc. etc. etc. Btw., taxi is pure robbery (30EUR for transfer to Hévíz?!), I recommend to purchase it by mail days before arrival for price max. 6000 HUF. No bistro, no cafe (was closed). And do not buy anything after security, those prices in the bar in waiting area above gate are ridiculously expensive (on Heathrow you can get better and cheaper..)"

691,2733,"It's small, but clean and equipped (i think) airport."
692,2738,"A very small airport! No WIFI. No security at all. No buses to and from the airport, only taxis (and remember that there are only 17 taxis in whole Akureri) A kiosk where you could buy coffee and a sandwich."
693,2740,"I had two problems traveling through KEF. First the food selection is poor and the food is so expensive, the second was the security controls, the personnel asked if i had any liquids with us and I told them I hadn't, then they found out I had a toothpaste in the luggage and were very rude telling me I didn't signaled it when I was asked for liquids. This is the first time I had to declare the toothpaste! After they emptied out all my luggage, with a bad tone the guy told me they were doing the best security checks compared to other airports.."
694,2750,This is the worst airport I've seen so far in Europe. No space between duty free and baggage claim results in people getting stuck. Once outside there are no instructions on how to get to either Keflavik or to the city centre. No money exchanges. Ended up taking the most expensive cab of my life to the hotel.
695,2755,Small airport and quite boring but a plus for their space between the streets!
696,2758,You can not sleep at the airport!
697,2765,0
698,2770,"No good lounges to chill, and not restaurants in the airport domestic terminal, and not-so-interested shop workers."
699,2771,"Securtiy was some of the worst ever. Long lines, AC wasn't properly working, and our flight was delayed."
700,2774,"Let's be honest, Ahmedabad Airport is on the side of the worst airports I have seen. Although the departure section is just alright, the arrival is too bad. The baggage comes too late and the immigration and customs part is too slow and weird. In addition the customs check requires you to take up your baggage and get it checked thrice, which makes it only worse."
701,2778,"By far the worst airport I have ever been to. Airline staff were nice. Airport staff were rude but also not properly equipped to do their job. There was an employee standing in the only working washroom in the whole terminal. His job was to splash water on your hands from a bucket (using the splash scoop from the toilet stall) because the sink is not working. Concessions do not allow any bottled drinks to be taken for meal coupons, only allowing drinks made with local water."
702,2788,Businesslounge is a desaster! Never enough seats and very small. Also noisy TV's everywhere which won't allow any rest.
703,2789,"Very Nice airport. Good management, very clean. Liked the view around the airport."
704,2790,Was a terrible airport then.
705,2791,Apparently it is one of the busiest airports in the world but there isnt much going on there. Its very clean though and heaps of restaurants and shops. Very easy arrival and you will find yourself in a taxi in no time.
706,2792,The airport was not impressive.
707,2797,TEST
708,2801,Small airport but it's way too much expensive for meals Try bringing your own meals Also there's no WiFi service It needs ton of improvements
709,2803,good airport according to its needs..
710,2804,much better than before but pigeons are inside the terminal.
711,2805,Pigeon inside terminal!
712,2806,Very plain
713,2807,Security Check for Transit passengers is a bottle neck as there is only a single counter & screening machine.
714,2810,"Terible airport, if you want go inside you already shoud have ticket, if you have only booking number nobady let in, planty security check( only in coridor to airplane you have 4 checks..."
715,2811,Really awful to be honest and the staff aint friendly. If u travel by economy make sure that u have to wait for an hr to get your luggage as they really slow at what they do. awful experience in my opinion.
716,2812,What else can go wrong. Be it the rudest service professionals anywhere in the world; or hours of waiting time in a closed space with no AC turned on; or security with little clue of what they were searching (apparently the mobile charging cable) or the passengers with no understanding of courtesy or personal space.
717,2830,"""Silent Airport"" rule is terrible. Flights and boarding info are not announced at the gate, boarding is chaotic and confusing. Restrooms were dirty and in poor condition"
718,2831,"""Silent Airport"" rule is terrible. Flights and boarding info are not announced at the gate, boarding is chaotic and confusing."
719,2834,Nice Airport - Smart with No Fuss - Straight through and out in three minutes - Wish all airports were this fast.
720,2836,Avoid taking a flight in the peak time as the terminal gets overcrowded and there is no place to sit or stand. Literally. Due to so many people in one hall its tends to get hot even in the winters. Purchase food from the city or outside the airprt premises as it is very expensive inside the airport
721,2839,a) nightmare for an international/domestic transfer. b) No airline staff. c) No one is bothered.
722,2840,God forbid if you have a connecting flight. a) The airline staff pass the buck to the security personnel. b) The security staff are reluctant to help. c) The immigration staff ... well.
723,2841,"1. Slow security check. 2. Slow immigration. 3. Airline officials nowhere to be seen. In short, a disaster if you have a connecting flight."
724,2842,"We had a connecting flight to Bali. And the stopover was 1.30 hours. In any other airport in the world, it is more than adequate. Not so at Delhi airport. 1. The security staff work at an ant's pace. 2. The immigration officials seem busy about nothing. 3. God forbid if your gates are far away. You'll just have to pray and run. 4. Don't even depend on Vistara officials. They are sleepwalking their way at the airport. 5. Oh, our luggage was broken. 6. Food sucked."
725,2851,"AVOID TRAVELLING INTERNATIONAL FROM THIS AIRPORT! or atleast don’t arrive very early. I had to wait at security for the security to arrive and once throught, there is chairs which are damaged and only 3 food options ( a wrap shop, a coffee shop and a bar). There was a glass wall which seperates the better domestic area with restaurants such as KFC, Subway and Chaipoin, which you can see signs for across the glass. Also there are these huge scary-looking fans which gives an uncomfortable breeze. Tip: fly domestic from this airport and try getting a connecting flight at Mumbai or Delhi."
726,2852,Long queue to enter the airport terminal & no proper signage’s near the checkin area. Terminal needs a definite upgrade the way travel industry is booming
727,2858,The coldest airport I have ever used with the fans. And the prices are extortionate. And there are so many annoying flight calls some times one over the other.
728,2859,"Terrible service, terrible airport, terrible long customs, everything is very slow, queues everywhere. No Business lounge. little food and everything is expensive. They constantly ask for boarding and printed tickets. For what? They don’t ask at any airport, even a military man stands at the entrance and checks for the presence of a printed ticket. Nonsense and stupidity."
729,2862,"Crowded airport. No restaurant after you get past security, only food shops. Restaurant is good enough but food is expensive."
730,2864,Landed on Runway 02
731,2871,"This was an awful experience. The terminal is undergoing complete refurbishment which means cement, tile dust everywhere and the noise! Avoid for now if you can - or suggest you get to airport at last minute for your flight to minimise time at terminal."
732,2872,"I also request, please update the database of the new airport in Hyderabad, Hyderabad / Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (HYD/VOHS)!! New airport is good!"
733,2881,"Novwifi, unless you have indian phone number (well, you dont have indian nulber, if you are tourist and jaipur is your first indian point at the map)"
734,2886,Fucking Airport only 2 gates which goes directly to Plane
735,2894,"Make sure you will pack any navigation system, e.g. Garmin, into your Check-in baggage. The security staff insists that such devices are eligible to some rules that won't allow such ""GPS""-devices, even if obviously not 2-way communication, into onboard luggage. They don't get the point and insist on check in luggage stubbornly."
736,2897,"the standards have really fallen. Ola taxi drivers refused to take me and wanted to know what the cost was on the app. Basis that, he'll decide whether to take me or not. The baggage took forever to come. The bright side was, the airport was clean. Even the loos were clean."
737,2900,"Calcutta Airport is a nightmare especially if you are taking a connecting flight. The seats are uncomfortable and you are unable to stretch out. The lounges are inside AFTER the check in counters. Which means, if you have landed up early through another flight, you cannot use the lounge UNLESS the check in counters open. What bizarre planning. Shows how if you give the planning of an airport to an office babu, disaster happens."
738,2905,"Very basic airport with few processes (other than security), little organization and shopping opportunities, no WIFI, no lounges"
739,2906,"Since there's high military presence and tensions, security is high. Infrastructure are not good. Small and unorganized. Boarding and security check is not up to satisfaction. Check-in was good. They did us a favour by check in us for the whole journey at once"
740,2908,"Air India application boarding pass was not accepted by security, so I was not allow to go security check. When I downloaded the web generated boarding pass then I could go."
741,2925,Very long walk from the gate to immigration. Long queues at immigration. Great offers at Duty Free. Poor experience to catch connecting flights.
742,2926,"Relatively new terminal. But rather archaic transfer procedures. Insufficient air-conditioning, passenger hogging multiple seats to sleep, park their baggage etc. The priority lounge in departure is a crowded mess with insufficient seating. Quality of food was great though. But access to the lounge is not possible until after checking into the connecting flight. Long distances to walk from check-in to boarding gates."
743,2930,Coming out of the aerobridge into the terminal building was a surprise small area neat and clean and nicely done up. Besides one washroom there is no lounge or stall or food / tea counter where a passenger can grab a bite. No airline personnel is present at the carousel area to help a passenger. The bags arrive at their own sweet will and are just tossed on to the belt. The ground staff is least bothered about what damage could happen to the stuff in the bag or the bag itself
744,2931,The check-in counters for Qatar Airways are very strict and unhelpful. The Airport lacks good Wi-Fi facilities. No lounges.
745,2939,"Very poor airport , terrible facilities , no one believes in quoue keeps bumping into you . At the check in counter seems like a old shack where again bunch of jokers stand behind the counters to issue you boarding passes . Don't be surprised if your baggage gets lost . Terrible air conditioner, very bad can't write much"
746,2942,This Airport doesn't have Food Court or Food Options at all. Only thing you can get it either Tea or Coffee.
747,2944,"When walking to the plane you are at the tarmac sharing the area with people, planes and tractors. The sound at the terminal is not very good, so put attention or you could miss your flight."
748,2945,"Very poor airport. Driving to PNQ is a wild ride. Terminal facilities are very poor. Looks like a bus terminal. No decent food is offered, I was not able to find a lounge. Going through immigration is a nightmare. Boarding is not an organized process."
749,2947,"One of the most horrible airport's I've been to. While the other airport's get revamped and upgrades, Pune Airport still remains the same. Untouched !!!! Why ? Dont you want to progress in life ? With the increase in domestic traffic and Pune becoming a secondary western export/import hub after Mumbai. It is high time they start expanding. This expansion should have started a long time ago. International flight have been stopped !! Why ? Because VAPO is not equipped with the facilities. It is high time they realize the opportunity benefits from Intl flights."
750,2956,The Bagdogra Airport will take you back to the dark ages. It's chaotic. The loos are dirty. There are no places to sit. And the flights are always delayed. The lounge is a nightmare. Just 40-50 chairs kept in such basic settings that they'd have the Spartans jumping with joy. I find it bizarre. Bagdogra is touted as an international airport with flights leaving for BKK and Paro from here. Its also the gateway to the NE. Why would they have such an appalling airport?
751,2957,"Small airport, overcrowded, very limited food options inside airport. Go early. you would need to scan beg before dropping them according to airline"
752,2959,"Very crowded and fairly under resourced airport , please keep sufficient buffer for check in as only limited slots are available being a military airbase hence limited flying as result most of the airlines have the back to back departures"
753,2960,The airport looks very ordinary despite catering to six carriers from India and Bhutan. There are only two gates and no aero bridges at the airport. The bathrooms and other facilities are very very ordinary. WiFi connection was a bare minimum.
754,2962,"Horrible, horrible place."
755,2963,"India's worst airport. Even before entering the airport, you will be treated with extreme security which involves screening all bags. The airport is very congested and overly crowded. It also lacks shops and a food court. They do not even have an operating WiFi system. The bathrooms are dirty with inoperative flushes while some bins are overflowing with garbage. This airport is a shame for such a beautiful place. Would like to see AAI fix it or open a new terminal."
756,2970,make sure you've at least a day as a buffer if you're planning to catch an international flight at another city
757,2979,"Easily accessible, you can reach the airport from anywhere in the city in 15-20 minutes. Terminal is basic, duty free is usually closed, baggage is slow, nothing to do, no wifi, very basic. Parking is ample but people park their cars in the only alighting area and park them irresponsibly, causing huge jams. the internal road is good but as soon as you leave it it is just a big mess, not that there is not a mess inside due to honking unnecessarily, bad parking, etc."
758,2985,"Flight canceled due to lack of passengers, we were diverted to Delhi. Loss of a day. Most of the time this company cancels the flight. They count the passengers in line and if it doesn't work out, they cancel it without prior notice, putting the passengers on the flight to Delhi to spend the night there and take the morning flight to Kathmandu. That is to say a day wasted."
759,2986,"The interiors are modern and tidy but there is no place to buy anything to eat, just a small stand with some unappealing sandwiches."
760,2987,Very simple airport
761,3006,The airport is pretty small and really cramped even for a 737 flight from Kuala Lumpur. The problem with the size actually because the airport is meant to be an air force base.
762,3007,Very limited shopping and food options. Required registration for free WiFi only possible with Indonesian numbers. Taxi maffia operating at the airport.
763,3008,"Small, simple airport, but with several issues: Baggage delivery takes very long, WiFi only for registered customers with local phone numbers, taxi stand hard to find, military operation can shut down airport, ..."
764,3009,"I took a taxi to the airport. Due to the crazy thunderstorms that started in the afternoon, the car was completely jammed when I approached the airport and I couldn't move. Moreover, some parts of the airport were under maintenance, which made the two-way single-lane road into the airport less than one kilometer even more blocked. If it hadn't been for heavy rain, we would have had to run over. The flight was completely unable to take off on time due to weather factors. There was only one domestic waiting room, and people were crowded in. There was not enough room for air circulation. Boarding resumed only after the rain stopped. Aircraft work... (On the way into the airport, someone rides a motorcycle to help carry luggage for people who are stuck in traffic and can't catch the plane, and then the people run over there, making money!)"
765,3017,"Getting to airport is easy but they have few parking lot so it will be a mess when we find the parking lot. the terminal facilities is very bad, like a dirty market. the wifi is average for Indonesian connection, and at least they have coffee bean inside and they have good lounge with special gate to go to the airplane. the baggage claim condition is very bad, they only have 2 baggage claim area for 93 flights everyday."

767,3023,"1. Keep some time in hand when you set out for the airport. The notorious Bali traffic is sure to play spoilsport. 2. At the airport, the Wifi is a nightmare. it keeps getting disconnected. Speed is a big issue too. 3. Duty Free shopping is okay. Nothing spectacular. 4. The standard response by ground staff is, they are not authorised to do (whatever it is you are going to request them to do)."
768,3031,"Overall, very bad airport. It doesn't have classical indoor space but it is connected to the outside. That's why it is incredibly hot inside. Perhaps, there are running many air-conditoons to cool it down bit. The operation must be very ecological and cheap."
769,3039,"Arriving at Jakarta airport was atrocious, >2hrs to get through immigration. Leaving was a million times better, more like you would expect of an international airport, well organised and efficient unlike the unmitigated chaos on entry."
770,3067,"The new airport at Praya is beautiful at sight, but has its shortcomings. Upon arrival, taxi drivers will dive down on passengers like vultures; the Departures are downright chaotic, with no seating only at the gate, which opens relatively late. Unless you pay for a lounge, you're only chance to sit down is a cafe. Not a good experience overall."
771,3075,"This is the arrival terminal rating. It's literally just a house with a conveyor, busy and dirty toilets"
772,3076,"The airport is located around 30 minutes drive from Malang City. It is a very small airport, small terminal and not much facility in the airport. No executive lounges even for business class passenger. The toilet is small and poor conditions. No wifi detected, there are some small food counters on the outside. Waiting for the new terminal to open next door."
773,3077,this airport under construction
774,3103,"a little bit crowded, the building is a little bit old school. no exceptional facilities here. becareful to buy food and beverage here. for a bowl of instant noodle, they can charge you up to 10 times than the normal price. check in counter is a lame."
775,3107,"Small airport, parking lot always full. The grocery store close at 7pm. So if you hungry, better bring snack."
776,3110,"Semarang is in Indonesia, not India"
777,3115,The airport needs to start open up for any online public transport to collect/ pick up passengers and stop the monopoly.
778,3121,Laneways for passenger drop off is very inconvenient and not traveller friendly. Airport is very hostile to Uber and Grab car-hailing app users to create a monopoly for airport-run taxi companies.
779,3122,Airport is closed to Uber and other car-sharing apps to allow taxis to monopolize the market. Totally archaic way of operations that is not friendly for travellers.
780,3126,Adisumarmo is nice airport...
781,3129,Traffic to arrive is a pain. Check-in is a pain. Security is fast. Domestic waiting area is small with very limited shops and seats. Relies on announcements for boarding.
782,3130,"Air Asia lands on Terminal B. You walk in from the plane, there is one luggage belt, outside hyena taxist hordes and a tour agent who wants to sell you rupia for a ridiculous rate. Ignore everyone and walk outside to Terminal A if you don't want to be screwed over big time."
783,3131,On arrival the scene was one of chaos. The visa on arrival counter is hard to find. There was no luggage carousel. One had to climb over other people's bags laid out in small area. In order to get cash from an ATM machine you need to exit the international section and walk 200m to the domestic terminal. One ATM only gives out $5 maximum. Only one machine gives out larger amounts.
784,3133,"A Lovely Airport , like a Province , Jogja . and friendly people in there"
785,3135,domestic terminal
786,3137,Wifi doesn't work at all and the distance from the city itself completely ruins all good aspects. A 1.5 hour transfer to the centre (at night with no traffic) is insane. Good services and food spots.
787,3138,Wifi doesn't work at all and the distance from the city itself completely ruins all good aspects. A 1.5 hour transfer to the centre (at night with no traffic) is insane. Decent services and food spots.
788,3139,My golf bag was missing and I have to wait for a long time until I found it at the different airline’s office. I asked some person working at the airport but they said just wait at the place for suitcases. There should be an oversized luggage counter.

792,3161,"Third-world airport, with shady currency exchange offices, pushy personnel at the gift shop, unclear access (our taxi had to bypass concrete roadblocks...), and worrying security checks (metal detector was likely off, and the security guard literally groped me!) The building is half-derelict and there are some works in progress that seem to be ongoing since long, long time. Seats in the ""waiting room"" were unstable. AC ports were not working. The boarding area is a simple room with a door facing the apron. There are no café, only a shop selling snacks and beverages. The only upside was a kind check-in operator and the toilets, that would have been sub-par in the western world, but that were among the cleanests in Iran. You asking about WiFi? Seriously?"
793,3163,plane was 2 hours late. the few announcements were only in Farsi. no displays beyond the check-in area. we did not know what was going on.

795,3170,"A Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) flight crashed shortly after taking off from the Iranian capital Tehran on 8 January, killing all 176 passengers and crew members on board."
796,3173,"Our baggage wasn't delivered, it arrived one day later and they couldn't organize to send it to our hotel, despite many many phone calls. We had to go back by taxi and look for it in a warehouse full of luggage! Very far from city and with poor connection. The metro train has a very limited service. The airport is very poor itself, with few shops and extremely rude and unreliable personnel."
797,3176,"In the future, airport subway trains will link up IKA to Tehran urban metro system, Line 1. VIP taxi cost 750,000 Iranian Rial to the city (for us, to Mehrabad Airport). Basic facilities like money exchange, some food joints, left luggage centre and airline ticket sales are available. Recommend to change as much money at IKA as it is hard to find money exchange in Tehran, if you do not have local friends. The airport money exchange accepts most european currency, USD, CNY, AUD and even MYR. Wifi is available under asiatech, free for 1 hour / 100MB, whichever applies first. You can get simcard there but do take note some shops may be closed during prayer time. You may want to take Tehran metro Line 1 termius station to Kahrizak and take a cab to the airport. Train tickets are really cheap (USD $0.20) while from Kahrizak, taxi costs 400,000 Iranian Rial. Take the yellow coloured taxi as the green taxis may quote you a higher price than the market."
798,3185,"Deported me on arrival due coronavirus country bans, government banning travel to/from affected countries but authorities banning affected countries passports even though not travelling to affected countries."
799,3186,On the boarding pass there is a man working in with al naser airlines he asked me to give him a 100$ to let me go on the plane with my family when i didn’t give him he told me he well never let me go so I recorded his voice and I called the police he told them that he was joking with me but plane was almost left and thay told to go to get my flight
800,3187,"1. Employees smoked in the airport. 2. A person in charge of the immigration office said, ""If you don't bribe me with $200 in cash, I will seize the bag."" The son of a bitch was smoking, too."

803,3190,"the security checks are soooo helllish, facilities are pretty 80's with some renovations. too bad this airport was a pioneer airport in the region. the war and embargo surely degraded it a lot"
804,3193,"Baghdad International Airport is a beautiful airport, but it still needs for more modern tech. and systems, some places must be renovated,anyway I like it and proud of it... all the best"

809,3204,"Little more than a glorified bus shelter. ISU is basic. Security measures are stringent, with multiple checkpoint and scans. Virtually no services once inside the airport complex."
810,3205,It's a small airport. It has no wifi and the food there at the shops is like ugh. Don't buy food from there never do it. The passport lines take long and the security don't even allow pens.
811,3234,Buses to and from Killarney are a bit sporadic. Tiny terminal which is to be expected. Unfriendly lady at info desk. Good free wifi.
812,3241,"I flew out of Knock on my holidays last year, as it was cheaper than Shannon. 1hr 30mins from Galway city on the worst roads I've ever seen. Adventually we reached this small depressing looking building in the lashing rain and were confused to weather it actually was the airport. Tiny little smelly horrible airport and there's more of an atmosphere in an old folks home. We were hit with a random €10 flight charge that wasn't on the Ryanair website. I was fuming at that point. We have to go through a cold tiny airport with a stale smell and pay €10 for the luxury? If I was offered a free flight from there I wouldn't take it. Tips: Fly to Shannon."
813,3246,Knock-Alicante. Ryanair. Great
814,3281,Terminal 1 is unorganized mess of different queues where your quest is to collect correct passport labels.
815,3284,There is one lavoratory for a thousand people. The terminal is small and overcrowded. There are 100-120 seats for a thousand people. The Wifi is terrible. The only positive side is the location of the airport.
816,3296,"Small airport, no facilities, expensive short term parking. The worst connection ever to Ancona (the last bus/train from the airport to the city departs before the last flights arrive). A way for the local taxi drivers to make money. Shameful."
817,3310,"Toilet are often dirty Very few seats in waiing areas Parking is very expansive, dirty and often there are problems with paying"
818,3314,"Airport with extremely confusing, poorly signposted and chaotic exit. It was very difficult to catch the bus to the city center, at least on the day I was there."
819,3315,"The Marconi Express is a quick way of getting to the airport from the railway station in Bologna. The trains are pretty short and don't have many seats, but they are regular. It takes about 15 minutes and from the station, it is a short walk to the terminal building. The automatic ticket machines can be a little tempramental. The airport is small and probably never designed to handle the number of passengers it is handling. I'm beginning to feel that so many of my travel woes are down to Ryanair. They seem to have a knack of ruining every airport that they don't exclusivley use as they seem to take up every available slot with their high density aircraft. Both landside and airside, every space was crammed. I did manage to find a table at one of the few food outlets landside. I was lucky. Many of the tables and chairs were occupied by customers who had long finished any food that they might have had and were nursing a half empty bottle of water. Everything seems to take much longer in BLQ than in most other airports that I've travelled from. I had checked in online, but it made no difference. There were two queues. I was confused as to which one was the bag drop and which was the check-in. Both were moving as slowly as each other. It took at least 30 minutes to check-in. Security took another 40 minutes. The queue began at the top of the stairs and snaked about 400 metres around the length on the hall. It was all a bit disorganised. The departure lounge was equally as full as landside areas. All of the food and drink outlets had large queues and no available seats. There were no free seats anywhere in the departure lounge. Boarding was via transit buses. I waited until the queue had dissipated before approaching and boarded the last of the buses to leave, which had less than ten of us on board."
820,3317,The terminal is terribly overcrowded. There seems to be too many flights/passengers for the design and size of the terminal and facilities.
821,3329,"Check-in counters totally overloaded, always urgent late-comers skipping the long waiting lines. The staff seemed to be unmotivated, confused and there were technical difficulties with network and belts ..."
822,3332,"I do not like the fact that the WiFi isn't free of charge, even we are in the 21st century. You need to write you mobile and to receive sms with pin with the tax. It's written that is free, but in practice is not. There aren't any duty free too. Inside after security checks, haven't smoking zone and vending machines."
823,3336,"Security problem: This is the first airport to have a problem with a small table knife from a travel set. When they try to explain or contact their superior, they call the police."
824,3337,"It's a late summer day and the airport is definitely crowded. I can't imagine what it's like in August. Only one operational terminal out of 3 existing ones, terminal 2 simply abandoned, I would say for years, thanks to the employees, who truly work miracles, if everything goes perfectly."
825,3338,"Arrival fine. Departures (to non Schengen) a complete mess. Badly designed access, no announcements, lousy facilities. Not pleasant! PS BA flights don’t get fast track or lounge access"
826,3340,"WHAT!?!? Not a frickin’ seat available after the security checks?!? They remove all the seats for some reason... NOT A SINGLE SEAT, everybody had to wait for boarding STANDING! This airport just keep getting worse and worse... not even in Africa or in the third world countries I’ve seen such an awful airport! Oh and by the way the pigeons are still flying over the head of the passengers in the boarding area!"
827,3341,"Nightmare as always, the main terminal after the security checks is OVERCROWDED and CHAOTIC, even on a Sunday afternoon of October (which is not peak season) there wasn't even a SINGLE SEAT AVAILABLE (none in the terminal or the cafeterias) so people had to sit on the ground! Also the main terminal is really DIRTY because of the pigeons that DEFECATE on people and seats. In the restrooms only half of the tap/dryer works."
828,3342,"Not your typical small European airport. A nightmare. Checking very very slow, with long queues. Security was OK but then passport control took up the rest of the time in the terminal. Hot and sweaty, no food or drink beyond passport control."
829,3343,Terribly under staffed checkin. Long security queues. Even longer passport control queues. Horrible and tiny non schengen area with no eating facilities. Chaotic boarding.
830,3344,Catania is a small local airport and the car hire companies are located a long walk from the terminal and they will just try and rip you off. Temrinal has almost zero facilites and its crap generally.
831,3347,"Check-in area close to the entrance. Scalo Small but for the flows it has it could be fine if it weren't for the fact that it is poorly organised. Control area sacrificed in a small corner and waiting area the size of a corridor of a normal airport. If there are 2 flights at the same time it becomes chaos. Arrivals area that seems to have been created from a garage, very claustrophobic. The management company doesn't seem to have the will to let it ""take off"". Not easy to reach for those arriving from outside the province. The proximity to Turin should not be seen as a problem (an excuse used many times to justify the lack of services) but as an opportunity. The operators are very kind. Small but beautiful structure surrounded by the beautiful arch of the Maritime and Cottian Alps visible from the children's play area"
832,3348,"Poor management of passenger flows. With two flights at the same time the staff did not seem to be up to the task. Long queues formed, and the waiting times were very long for everything, making it impossible to access the bars even just for a coffee. a single check-in clerk is too small for the number of passengers"
833,3349,Very good assistance at reception
834,3350,"Terminal facilities at a minimum required level. Amazing that arriving passengers, after the bus ride, have to go through a small door to enter the terminal with long queues as a result, in cooking sun or pouring rain. Terminal space too small."
835,3354,"Italy while renowned for its food, remains a third world country with shitty infrastructure and even shittier work ethic. Cheerrsss:)"
836,3355,"I have evere seen an airport as this. it is very poor it looks like an hospital, after security check you go in a tube and you come out i a lounge with a beautifull resturant with a beautifull view on runway and you could see aircraft, their pushbavh and take off"
837,3358,"Due to limited runway length this airfield is unreliable. Staff try but are sadly not as customer focused as they should or could be. No a Unique problem to the airport sadly. Baggage claim slow, huge lines at immigration for non schengen arrivals. For a small airfield it should be super quick and convenient, The car rental location is too far away, and too frequently there are no Taxis and the line is huge, particularly if Fiorentina are playing!! I don't travel their for free WiFi, so that comment is taken with a pic of salt, its the reliability and marginal nature the limited runway causes is the main contributing factor, which when tourism is the major income earner for Firenze/ Toscana is quite astounding. All in all a shambles which few seem to care about correcting. Things are little better at Pisa, and worse at Milan or Rome. If as is frequent, you get diverted expect a bus journey from Pisa or Bologna is lucky or Rome / Milan if not. And to find anyone to assist in that event is like finding hens teeth. One tiny cafe in the departure lounge which is staffed by rude and un willing staff is a pleasure to avoid and a chore to use! I choose the ""least bad"" option when travelling to Firenze which is Pisa. If you are travelling here expect disruption. Try to spend the minimal amount of time there and expect no courtesy from anyone."
838,3360,"waiting for boarding in a small room with few chairs, without air conditioning and half in the dark. Quite rude staff."
839,3362,Poor and small airport located in a horrible city!!!
840,3363,once i was there the one and only ATM machine was out of service. poor
841,3364,Poor and small airport bue nice city :)
842,3367,"Awesome city, airport small and poor."
843,3368,"Terrible airport. Frustrated staff, no luggage."
844,3369,"Nice city, recomandate"
845,3374,Baggage check was terribly slow. It is disorganized and the private company that manages it should select its employees better
846,3381,"There were too many people at the airport, too much waiting at check-in, the plane had to be delayed due to a large number of stranded passengers, the airport employees were unable to inform us about our flight, the Internet check-in was unavailable, a very stressful time."
847,3383,Our bags didnt arrive and the stuff wasnt very friendly and we had to wait for about two hours till they knew what we have to do. also we had about 20' delay
848,3384,"While arriving here isn't a good experience (e.g. baggage delivery took 40mins), departing is even worse. Airport staff took >60 minutes to check in ONE passenger with XL baggage. Security check didn't detect water bottles that shouldn't have gone through, according to regulations. Boarding was chaotic, almost no services in terminal. Six people on my booking (incl 3 children) were assigned 4 different rows. Very unprofessional."
849,3391,"morning peak one security in service only, queues long as f, bathroom bad - all contact - nonhygienic and dirty, very bad airport for overnight stops, very unfriendly"
850,3392,"They go out of their way to not allow you to access any kind of electric outlet except for designated spots where you need to pay to charge your phone. Missing a proper cooked meal restaurant. There is only a mcdonalds and other places where you can buy panini, pizza, salad or a simple pasta dish. There is no comfortable seating for a nap."
851,3394,"No WiFi or electricity, everything really expensive. A panini and a cola cost 15€. Not enough benches."
852,3396,"Forexchange take 20% of fee on tax refund without consent! Fast track is for security check only, trolley not allowed, common line for passport control."
853,3397,"arrivals Saturday 3 July; from 7.02pm to 7.28pm 6 flights arrive, we wait for the bus, after getting off the plane calmly and regularly, for over 22 minutes. Is this the new ""service""? SABCO wakes up or calls back those who have to operate."
854,3398,"The worst airport ever. Lots of people on the floor. The military carries weapons. There is no transport at night at all. Many low-cost airline flights arrive at night, and a taxi costs a fortune."
855,3399,There are no sockets in the walls all over the terminal on purpose because if you want to charge your phone or computer you have to PAY. Its revolting! I have never seen anything like that at any European airport!
856,3405,"Long waiting times (+45 minutes) at security, mainly caused by the fact they only opened a couple of security lines. Several airport staff members just present watching the long lines, but not doing anything about it."
857,3406,"Very few places to seat, poor wifi connection, almost all of the shops and restaurants were closed, they were not allowing people to sit at the tables to eat."
858,3408,No transit desk! Stand-by travelers have to go out and reach check-in aerea for new check-in and customs procedures.
859,3411,"- international flight to London has terrible boarding (you have small room for waiting for nothing) - EasyJet baggage dispatch tried to check your visa manually with only one lady, who doesn't have time to do it all"
860,3415,"getting to the airport - train strikes that almost impossible to find out in advance, so took a bus last minute passport control is SO rude it's ridiculous no plugs to charge, very disappointing duty free"
861,3416,Inefficient bus shuttle from plane to terminal ATC on strike seems to be a consistent theme for Lombardy
862,3418,"The airport is very disorganized,and it's less modern than airports like TRN and NAP.They let us wait 40 minutes to control passports,there was a big and chaotic queue. Very bad considering it's one of most important airports in europe"
863,3419,"Strikes occurred and airport was overcrowded and slow. Facilities closed after a while. Few restaurants, far from city."
864,3421,"As a regular traveller I have to say this is probably the worst airport I have visited. Arrivals and departures nearly always delayed. Bus service to and from aircraft is a shambles. Immigration is by far the worst ever experienced made worse by rude and obnoxious staff that take great joy in stamping a new page of the passport every time you go in or out. Terminal is overcrowded, stuffy and just sub standard. Lounge is a overcrowded and basically a monopoly so could care less attitude. Queues are typical Naples, complete chaos, especially when it comes to boarding."
865,3426,"I've never been so hot in an airport, theres's no A/C whatsoever. No jetbridges either, you have to go down the stairs to your plane. I have to admit the security was pretty fast and there's a lot of comfortable seating."
866,3439,strong wind by the start
867,3440,An Italian Island
868,3441,"Extremely bad organisation at boarding , hoarding people in a terminal with heavy and hot air at terminal B."
869,3442,"Arrived at the airport 3 hours before our flight. Once we got in the check-in line (immediately after the desk numbers were announced), we remained in that line for over two hours, because every Ryanair flight in the whole airport (around 5) was checking-in from only two check-in desks and it took them about an hour and a half to finally open three more. We were also still in the line by the time our plane was supposed to leave - luckily it was delayed by an hour, and then we ended up taking off over two hours after we were supposed to. It was incredibly hot with no air conditioning, and incredibly stressful. I will never be going here again if I can help it."
870,3444,How it is possible to have a lack of buses and cause delay. It was disaster to wait over 40minutes to wait in queue
871,3449,The Airport is a desaster. They re rebuild it almost for 6 Years and the workings re still in progress. Its a shame. Vergogna.
872,3454,"Usual terrible deplaning and passport control, almost no organization and no managment of the spaces"
873,3456,"This airport has full potential of being easily reachable, a perfect position in the territory, quite low air traffic. The company which manages the airport is terrible and is really determined in making poor profits from such an easily profitable activity. Airport mangement is awful and closed-minded. Looks like they've never seen how an airport should be in their life. Bad toilets. Poor environments conditions. Badly functioning and uncomfortable parking system. The security checks especially are extremely badly managed, inefficient and also useless in increasing people's security. Single line for the entire airport, two flights at the same time and everything clogs and gets delayed. No room to make the lines. Ugly spaces. But local airline is great.."
874,3458,"extremely easy to get there from the highway. beside this, nothing..no shops after security, just two or three touristic shops at the entrance. only one bar, do not rely on it for your cigarettes shopping. being so small, you can get there literally 10 min before your scheduled time as you will find some queue at the security, but it's very likely it will be all for one flight only, your flight indeed!"
875,3459,"Poor, old and very small airport. 3 gates, no air conditioning system, Poor service. Terrible and stincky toilets. Small parking, no duty free after secuity!!! I hope you'll never land in this airport!!"
876,3462,"Getting to the airport from our city centre hotel was quick and cheap. (15 mins/ £9.50) Check in was very quick and painless too and passport control despite being busy was pretty straight forward. However, the facilities thereafter are pretty basic. There were far too few seats available, the Wi-Fi worse than terrible and not enough places to get some food."
877,3464,Worst airport. Much worse than Warsava Modlin. Overcrowded. Too much people. No breath. Easily spread of COVID.
878,3470,Small airport with limited schedules flights to Rome & Milan. Located close to town with narrow roads.Terminal small and chaotic with no organization. Security very slow with very small table to remove laptops etc from bags and the same after scanner. Departure lounge has 2 gates and small coffee shop.
879,3471,Small airport with great services. Perfect for business travellers.
880,3472,"Exceptional small airport, with an exciting landing operation (curvilinear approach like at the old Kai-Tak Hong-Kong). Very near to the city and to Aeolian Islands"
881,3475,Small and old little airport. Decent facilities
882,3476,Nice airport
883,3479,"A very very basic airport, with very limited seating. Not the kind of airport you want to be waiting for hours in"
884,3482,"Nice little airport, very basic, but very very busy and overflows when full. Bit hard to get to only local buses and taxis, but not far from town centre and its only 30mins by train to Rome and a quiet beautiful town to stay in."
885,3484,"Small airport, no places to sit, overcrowded, 40 min bus from Rome. Wifi and charger points at airport."
886,3486,The airport closes around midnight for about 3 hours and the personel kicks out everybody who is inside.
887,3487,"Security was shocking, Ryanair staff were also shocking, staff were there to harass all customers and not help"
888,3489,"It took 5 wheelchair rides to transfer from a domestic flight to a US bound flight. If it weren't for the fact that we had over 3 hours of connection time, we would not have made it."
889,3495,"Large Layout, Gates far apart and had to board plane via stairs. Quite a trip to get from Gates A to E having had to go through a store at one point."
890,3497,"Well... My experience with that airport was slowly falling towards the tragedy. First of all, you have to pay 1€ to enter the airport by car... Luckily, you can still enter for free if you come by foot, but you never know when even this might end (Italians moves towards the tourists are becoming less and less favourable...). The airport is closed between 00:30 and 00:43, so you're kinda stuck for the whole night in Trapani, Marsala or anywhere else nearby (or you can sleep outside for 4 hours, sometimes in cold, cuz there's literally nothing to do around). The security check speeks surprisingly bad English. The guy took my phone with a QR-code and didn't give me back until I reminded him of it... Also, there was a mess with the gates and communications, although this was a Ryanair's fault as well. The airport is small with not so many interesting shops/cafés, I also haven't seen the sockets until the final gate departure hall. Not really recommending this airport if not necessary."
891,3501,"Great shop for top quality food, inside the duty-free area, hidden besides the self-service restaurant. One UNIQUE electric plug in the whole waiting room :("
892,3503,Closed 0:00-04:00 am
893,3513,"TERRIBLE on a Sunday morning NO QUEUES, just masses of people Passport control queue > 400 people waiting and SO VERY SLOW at getting through. We took over an hour. The flight had to be held for others behind us. AVOID AT ALL COSTS ON A SUNDAY"
894,3526,"this airport is one big tourist scam. bus from airport costs 10€, when you walking 10 minutes to first stop behind airport its 1,50. staff in airport thinks they are middle of universe."
895,3528,It is obligatory to buy bag in a duty-free shop. It's first time I see it. Spoiled all the impression. Smoking lounge is on repairing and no replacement proposed.
896,3530,"I have been to a few airports so far, but this one was really the one where i had the worst time. The staff was very slow, incompetent, the lines were so long, even at the duty free. I dont know if its cause im flying w delta airlines but I'm really disappointed. Commuting to the airport is also too expensive to be true."
897,3536,- overpriced transport to airport - very long waiting to security control even when there are only 2 flights departing - even longer waiting on covid vaccination certificates check - not enough space for people after security check so they must sit everywhere on ground and you can´t even move
898,3537,"Queue to security check, queue to check-in. Seems like they make queues on purpose to motivate you to pay for fast track"
899,3538,"Haotich airport! Very small airport and if i can i will put minus rating.That day in 16PM there were 2 flights on WizzAir to Skopje and Chisinau, 3 on RyanAir and a charter flight on Bulgarian Air Charter to Sofia.Haotich chek-in for the bagaage and i was WizzAir plus but there weren't a priority line nowere.And for boarding there wasn't priority for me.HAOTICH AIRPORT.Срамота, хаос!"
900,3541,"Extremely bad security check (queues are really long there, so you have to wait about 30-40 minutes to get the gates area. You always have to come two hours before your departure. Typical Italian"
901,3548,"Check in was awful - no queue just every man for themselves. Security was no different although more orderly, still slow. After passing through to airside, the facilities were reasonable enough but upon boarding the aircraft the airport ground team with their slowness caused a 1h40 delay (although this allowed me to chat with the pilots & take a look in the flight deck so I cannot complain)"
902,3549,"Like so many other Italian airport, it needs a major do over. The lounge is before security. The gate areas are small and crowded. Etc. Etc. Etc."
903,3550,"Is an horrible is so small and overcrowded. And it doesn’t has shops and restaurants. Only seating areas, it is a very bad airport and it doesn’t has any jet bridge"
904,3557,"Ok so this isn’t as great as Gatwick, the immigration line is quite long and very busy, the baggage claim is a bit stressful and the airport is very very hot when your coming from a place like the Uk, Walking through the jetbridge from your plane is hot but when you step into immigration it’s something else"
905,3558,"It’s old, you have to do twice the work in customs, crowed. It can be annoying to travel into this airport. Always have your passport out, you will need it at least three times while going through immigration and customs!"
906,3590,04 SP 6
907,3594,"In Sapporo, Tokyo, and Naha, unopened plastic bottles are exempt from checking, but here they are forced to check, like robots, saying the same thing. Probably won't come again."
908,3605,07 SP3
909,3615,The lounge in the Domestic Terminal is terrible. Common to JL & NH passengers. Narrow. No eindows. No food. I could no find even a coffee shop early morning in the concourses. I could not have any breakfast!!
910,3620,36 SP10
911,3621,36 SP5
912,3625,"The parking lots are as crowded as hell. Nearly missed our flight due to the full parking. Also there’re only 2 security check gates for international flights, which caused incredibly long queues. This airport should have definitely improved their ground infrastructure before adding the new runway."
913,3628,Arrival terminal is a disaster. No one can speak in English and it looks there like in a poor basement
914,3629,Peach cargo terminal is by far the worst terminal I've been to . You pay what you get for the Airline has cheap tickets because it doesn't have to pay high airport fees. The airlines is great just not its terminal .
915,3632,STA9:15
916,3633,36SP36
917,3635,"There are few restaurants and souvenir shops. I was especially surprised at how few shops there were on the JAL side (north). However, there are several stores after passing through the security check. However, there was no such information within the facility, which was inconvenient. Buses are convenient for access to the airport. There is also a monorail, but it seems difficult to use."
918,3636,Air traffic control favors ANA? Why is only JL139 held without waiting for the later ANA41?
919,3641,I don't want terminal construction to take place during the busy season. I also don't like the customer service attitude of the staff.
920,3642,Rather dysfunctional as check in and bag drop are 2 separate queues and counters. Very slow service too. Each queue takes about 20 minutes. Would recommend flying out of KIX instead even though that is a bit further from town.
921,3646,"Many many people, Terrible, long queue everywhere. The KIX north lounge is small ,limited food and drink choice. Uncomfortable seats."
922,3649,departing this airport in the international side is a complete shit show. was in a line of no exaggeration several thousand people. it took one hour and 10 mins. been to 50 plus airports and this is the longest security line I have ever seen. believe one can use the past pass lane with a business ticket which had no line to get thru security. wish i was told by text or some form of communication that the line was this bad. i bet a ton of people miss their flights here
923,3667,The airport is so small and its check-in counter and arrival hall is the same floor. There has only a few small souvenir shop.
924,3672,This airport has a fairly high level of deficiencies in that there is no lounge in the boarding waiting area. I seriously doubt that they had thought about creating a lounge in the boarding area from the beginning.
925,3682,"Easily the worst of the 10 or so airports I visited in ASIA recently. 1. Constant queueing 2. Unpleasant unhelpful staff 3. Incredibly annoying woman herding people into automated passport checking facilities 4. Terrible announcements in a robotic american english 5. Frantic almost bordering panic, shouting loud announcements calling last people to board"
926,3692,"Narita Terminal 2 has got to be one of the worst airport terminals I've ever been to. The place is old, cramped, lacks restaurants and or cafes and is just unpleasant to be at."
927,3696,"On first sight, the reaction is ""what a modern airport"" from outside and the space in the check in area. It goes downhill fast once checked in. Slow moving security queue, one lane open, some of the most archaic scanning equipment I've seen in a long time. Once through security, there's a cafe area with limited seating, a Made in Jersey shop, which we wanted to visit, closed before 16.30, a polished World Duty Free store then - a holding area with seating for special needs passengers, standing room, and a set of doors prohibiting passage until gate number shown. When we got to the gate, the security door to the tarmac was wide open the whole time we were there, even when the one agent left the gate to go to the plane."
928,3710,"If you are going to have flight connection in Amman and fly with RyanAir and didn't have passport one of EU countries please be ready pay 62.50 EUR per person for Jordanian Visa. Ryanair can't issue boarding pass after check in online for foreigners and you can't use transit area. That's why you have to cross passport control, pay for a visa and lost 1 free page in your passport. Then you are have to go check in counter, they just print boarding pass and you have to again go to passport control. Please be careful with Ryanair. It was awful experience."
929,3711,"This airport is a total abomination. The Guards are like the gestapo, totally heavy-handed, treat every one suspiciously, I will avoid this airport and this country forever, never again"
930,3715,"Possibly the worst experience with an airport I've ever had. The terminal building was opened only 1 hour and 20 minutes before my flight's departure! Imagine 180 people getting through check-in, security and passport control in such a short time. Moreover, I was held back by the customs officers, who had the need to unpack all my stuff. My whole backpack was unpacked while the gate agent started shouting at me ""hurry up, we are closing the gate!"", as if it was my fault. Incredibly amateur organization of the airport, I've never experienced anything like this."
931,3718,"Worst airport I’ve ever been to, took 90 mins to check in for a 50 seat flight. Can only get to the airport by taxi"
932,3719,Protip: Don't lose that baggage sticker they put on your boarding pass or you may find yourself leaving the airport without your suitcase.
933,3720,"call it airport is a big word, they don't even have a computer the check in is done on normal paper ticket like at cinema"
934,3722,"Literally chaos everytime, too many people and the airport is too small. Glad they are building a new one"
935,3723,"The lounge is beyond me: Access is granted with SEN/HON-status or similar / C-class ticket and that's about it. There is a decent selection of drinks for sale in the lounge. Yes: with your business-class ticket / SEN/HON-status you are eligible for buying drinks in the lounge, you otherwise would need to buy outside the lounge. It's small, dark, outdated, food selection is ok-ish."
936,3734,"Terrible excuse for an international airport. Long in need for bringing into the 21st century. Facilities are non existant, staff attitude is lack luster, security seems adiquate at best. Toilets are from the 1940's at best."
937,3735,Upon arrival ther're found that not involved public transport system. You can get to/leave airport only by your own car or by a taxi. Price is expensive little bit (((
938,3736,Small and clean airport. No jet bridges
939,3741,"Airport terminal needs reconstruction. Getting to the aircraft by bus. There is no wi-fi. There is no public transport to the airport from the town, only taxi. I wish it will be better in future."

941,3747,"One of the worst airport I've visited. It's very old and it's capacity does not correspond to the increased number of flights. Toilets are terrible. All airport is dirty. Personnel is mostly uncompetent, check-in have always the queue even when 1 flight is in 2-3 hours. Same security and passport control."
942,3749,"At the pick -up baggage area anyone from outside can enter. Moreover, no one from the airport check the baggage tags. Sometimes the baggage are already on the belt at the time when bus arrives. Terrible!!!"
943,3757,"Most shops now closed following the cancellation of most European charter companies flying to MBA. There's a bar still open. They have drinks and some food. Lounge only for OneWorld or paying, not worth it. Immigrations slow requiring you to fill in many forms with the same information each time? Customs corrupt. Baggage claim quick with porters helping you for a tip if you want but not pushy. No Wifi"
944,3761,Had a stopover here on a flight from JRO to FRA. Roof of the terminal is open at the sides. Strange: Birds were flying through the terminal.
945,3763,"Corrupt airport! Avoid JKIA! As white you’ll be just a little harassed, as black, you’ll miss your flight"
946,3777,This airport doesn't have a transit area. Do try to fly to Pristina if you don't have a multi-shengen visa!!! They will send you back to you departure country after a couple of days of being trapped at the airport
947,3778,They have no transit area. Do not fly to Pristina if you don't have a multi-shengen visa!!! They will send you back to you departure country after several days being trapped at the airport
948,3785,VERY TERRIBLE..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
949,3787,We had to wait ages for our bags to turn up and immigration felt like a millennium. Its toilets were filthy and grubby. It has a very simple layout which I did like though. They could have definitely put more and better shops.
950,3791,Jazeera Terminal has a dedicated parking as well as a park-and-fly service. The check-in counters on our flight was packed due to the holiday but was prioritized when check-in was about to close. The airport had a few shops and a little duty free prior to the boarding gate. There were no separation between gates and are typically transported by bus to the aircraft.
951,3793,Extremely painful experience with security controls. They keep coming up with strange rules unrelated to the what's on display. This is causing a lot of confusion and distress to passengers.
952,3795,"Had a transfer between the Jazeera Terminal and the terminal for Emirates. When we arrived to the terminal by bus, the friendly staff there told us to transfer we have to go through security and take another bus. We waited quite a while for the lone security to come and check our bags."
953,3798,"Unfortunately it's very small airport and getting there is impossible, parking is full and we couldn't get there on time coz of traffic. During arrival there was crowd of taxi, in the building, which in other airports in the world you don't see it. And they were so impolite. Sec check should know their job, and not just talk and laugh somewhere during their duty, during x-ray check they lost my phone, and later we found that there are thieves and sec check don't control that. It's cold in the terminal and seems we're somewhere in North Korea or similar... never come here for vacation!"
954,3801,"The airport is riddled with corruption. When taking off, they will dig into every thread, saying that this or that can kill a person on the plane, but the fact that I can harm with my belt, or with the utensils that are distributed for food, is nothing. And all for what, but in order to give them money, then they will let in hand luggage and even a liter of liquid. It’s 5 meters from the plane to the terminal, but there’s a bus and you wait half an hour for it to fill up. In the morning at rush hour, half of the passport control booths are open, the wait in line is an hour. It is better to fly through Almaty."
955,3802,"Terrible rough bumpy runway, makes you think the plane is gonna jump off before taking off or have a blasted tire.."
956,3809,"Old, kind of run down, small, but had WiFi. Chinese tour groups caused both check in and departure to be slow, as did Lao Airlines tendency to change and cancel flight times. Only one wine bar and minimal food. Surprisingly good shopping although just a few stores? No lounge."
957,3815,"At the check in I have asked for aisle seat in every flight they were issuing boarding cards, but I have been assigned a window seat 4 times, without any justification. The teller made also confusion about my final destination, and printed a luggage strip with a wrong airport code, which I remarked asking for e reprint. Two more staff members were called and the three of them made a messy second label, although I was spelling all the IATA codes of the 4 transit airports of my route. Is this a capital city or a remote village in the savannah?"
958,3818,Very noisy lounge
959,3820,"Lazy small airport, few restaurants , almost no shoppng, just grab a taxi to city centre for $7"
960,3822,"Super rude staff all along airport. Yelling at passengers, dealing with phones and ignoring work tasks."
961,3823,"The worst airport ever. A single water filling station for all gates, hardly working and with enormous queues to it. Everything is expensive like hell. Bottled water sold with the deposit fee €0.10, though no recycling machine is installed for refund."
962,3834,No place to seat at landside and no possibility to enter airside before opening check-in counter as they don’t allow online check-in. Quite annoying when flight departures at 3:40 and you have wait there for few hours. Wifi is only for 30 minutes.
963,3835,the screening process is two fold. you go through security before you even get to the gate. and then one more. so give extra time to get through security. there is no wifi here.
964,3837,Dreadful unnecessary security procedures and the Lebanese constantly push in but double standards when you have accidentally pushed in
965,3838,"Nice views of the planes from the gates but it is hard and annoying to get through the multiple security checks. Ensure extra travel time, as it could be a lengthy process. Not a lot of food options at all. The airport needs to be updated, as it was quite dated."
966,3839,"Maga security checking, please allow 3 hours on holiday weekends For check in and transit through to you gate,and you will still a final visa check after you have entered the ramp area!"
967,3840,"dirty airport, no adequate number of bathrooms, 1 or 2 places to eat, no public transit access, baggage pieces for final destination and in transit are dumped on the belt all together"
968,3841,"This airport is a disaster. Security before check-in - long line, then check-in - long line, Passports/immigration - line longer than at LAX - and again: security - long line... In the end, at the gate just before boarding the plane - one more control. Make sure you have 3hr to your flight."
969,3845,"I would love for it to be one of the best airports - and God willing, we will work towards that"
970,3846,"The airport is currently in bad condition, but God willing, its future will be better"
971,3847,Abraq International Airport - Libya
972,3848,awesome :)
973,3850,I LOVE Benina air port
974,3851,Benina is number one airport in Libya and really I'm very very happy to see Radar24 add it on its list ...
975,3856,"Misurata Airport is located a few Kilometers south Misuratah City Center. Very Organized Airport. Good Future. Nov.2013 more than 200 flights, Passenger and Cargo."
976,3857,Airport? I have no idea what was that place!
977,3858,Prominent
978,3859,Good Airport
979,3860,"More than wonderful services, good luck, God willing"
980,3862,Worst Airport IN THE WORLD
981,3863,This airport is a transit point for me to and from Libya
982,3864,"After the completion of the new Tripoli Airport project, it will be the best airport on the African continent"
983,3865,"God willing, it will be the best airport in North Africa"
984,3866,"Good luck, God willing"
985,3867,Tripoli International Airport
986,3868,"Finally Inbound schedule is appearing on the map , *****"
987,3877,"Horrible airport. Small (though not crowded at all) and not clean in July/August 2015. There were food rests on the floors in mutiple places. The toilets were smelly and sinks rusty. Finding some food was hard and the choice was rather limited. Parking at the airport is also over priced, with higher rates than in Riga or Vilnius. Worst thing is that you have to pay for those transparant bags meant to put your liquids in. Will try to avoid this dump at all cost."
988,3882,"Small airport, actually better looking and cleaner than thousands of other small airports. I don't know if somw WiFi connection is available cause I was in a hurry. There is only a small shop opened from early morning but more than enough for having a coffe, eating something and buying something. But, nothing more than this! Biggest problem is the transportation from and to the airport: only taxes are availbale and most of the drivers doesn't speak any kind of english. The price for the taxi ride is also too high compared to the lithuanian standards in my opinion"
989,3884,There was no air bridge to service our aircraft and it was pouring rain. We got soaked both when deplaning to the airport bus and when getting off the bus to enter the terminal. What a mess!
990,3891,"The check-in queue managed terrible, one flight took over a half of airport check-in room and blocked main entrance. The same flight boarding gates were not managed at all, priority passengers were crowling through other passengers to get to gates. If current circumstances require check-in at airport prepare for it and allow more than 2 hours to do it."
991,3893,"NO ATM in lounge areas, and need really a professional and customer oriented customer services staff at airport ( shops, security checking etc)."
992,3907,Macau Airport: all stores in Macau airport do not accept credit/debit card! only cash even in Mcdonald's
993,3915,"From the moment the planes touches the ground you get literally assaulted by people asking for many, police included. Border agents are really cocky and aggressive in asking for a ""tip""."
994,3916,"Custom officers are corrupt and demand money for their Service! Shops agree only Euro, no local money!"
995,3917,"Custom officers are corrupt and demand money for their Service! Shops agree only Euro, no local money!"
996,3918,Very small airport. Too many people asking for money exchange. Baggage claim was quick. Before boarding you are staying in a crowded seating area at 35°C with no air conditioning.
997,3926,"Good in automation Very bad in airport notification, gate to depart is very hard to find. Too many mosquito."
998,3932,"Worst airport experience ever. First went through a lousy security check with zero inspection done. Went to the gate, a small terminal but that was fine.And then 1 hour prior to bordering we went to the gate just to find out they had another security check point which basically just to ask people to leave their water behind. After the check at the gate there were no drinking fountain nor toilets. We were stuck at the gate for an extra hour due to the flight delay. No being able to get some water or use the toilet while everyone waiting for the flight in a small space. It make no sense having two lousy security check when you can set a proper one like every other airport."
999,3943,"KLIA 2 (AirAsia terminal only) is a pain in the ass! Literally! They care more about your baggage weight than any other service. It is very stressful not to exceed the kg limits not even in a gram. The staff observes you everywhere. On top of that, before entering the security check, AirAsia is weighing your carry-on luggage if it is below 7kg. Never happened to me before. I have travelled to many places and international airports around the world, however, I was surprised, or even shocked and couldn't believe my eyes. It's a truly low-cost experience and is not making your flying a pleasant, but rather a painful experience. Shame on that... You won't get any piece of your mind at all... It's a bit bothering me. And I'm the one who always carries less carry-on but feels awkward."
1000,3944,"Very bad airport with the worst immigration congestion, please avoid to travel to the KLIA, the immigration staf seems not to care with pax."
1001,3945,"KLIA check in frontliner was very bad, he refusing my request of fragile stickers and i got my baggage damaged on arrival"
1002,3956,"I didn't like it, although I was expecting something worse."
1003,3957,+ for free Wi-Fi
1004,3969,"There is almost nothing airside. Marry Browns is truly awful, the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf is closed for ""Renovations"" and most places only take cash. The Plaza lounge is small but ok. No toilets or wash room facilities in the lounge, you need to use the public wash rooms nearby. For some low cost airlines, you are not allowed airside until close to departure time."
1005,3976,"Unbelievably slow customs officer in our line. When all her colleagues managed to ""process"" 3 persons, then she barely manage one."
1006,3982,small but cosey and everything you need
1007,3990,"Brilliant Airport, unfortunately very dirty, actually FILTHY, restrooms / toilet / washroom facilities, I HAD TO HOLD MY NOSE. Customs was BRILLIANT, first class, the majority of the worlds' airports should TAKE a LESSON from the Customs team in PEN - EXCELLENT!"
1008,3991,"Great looking airport, VERY quiet, hardly any planes or passengers around, unsure why. Not clean, dust and dirt everywhere on the ground, toilets FILTHY, the stench was overpowering. Immigration was EXCELLENT, straight through, no queues at all, very friendly immigration officers, simple and fast process."
1009,3992,"PEN is far from the city center, George Town. it take about 30 mins by taxi(and driver said over 40 mins in rush hour) and about RM45(RM65 in surcharge time). Airport is very clean and well-drganized. many shops and restaurant. very convenient!"
1010,3994,Urgently needs a new terminal.
1011,3996,"Following on from fai's comment 2 months ago, the airport is still undergoing renovations. We flew domestic and departed from gate 12 where the airconditioning wasn't working so don't go to these departure gates until you definitely have to"
1012,4006,"We arrived at Malé Airport for our flight home, absolute chaos. It took us 1 hour 10 minutes to get to the first security bag scan, 30 minutes to check-in and then another hour to get through passport control and the second bag scan. If our flight hadn't been delayed we would have missed it. Bear in mind the queue for the first bag scan starts ottside, take plenty of water!!"
1013,4009,Went through 2 security checkpoints and a passport check prior to entering the boarding areas. The check in location looked old and outdated.
1014,4010,"Quite disappointing airport for a country promoting luxury tourism. Everything is worn down. No serious social distancing concept throughout the terminal. Queues at check-in and immigration are cramped - many passengers ignore basic health safety measures, staff does not really care. Idea of needing a QR-code to LEAVE the country frankly is stupid."
1015,4011,"Old airport, without lounge and correct wi-fi. They built new terminal for normal aircraft and doing the same for seaplanes. Both open in 2021 and 2022."
1016,4014,"Antiquated airport under redevelopment...don’t expect much! AC is adequate once through security but you may be sweating through checkin. There are NO jet bridges so you’ll use stairs in and out of Male. There are coaches, if the parking gate is far, but we walked to our Sri Lankan A330 Jet. As in all of the capital city of Male, no alcohol is served and all food appeared to be Halal. There was a Dairy Queen in the departure gate area. The bridge from the airport to the city of Male is now complete, just in case you have a few hours to kill."
1017,4030,Saturation of security checks due to departures at the end of the day of several large aircraft bound for Europe.
1018,4031,"The wait for the bagage delivery is ridiculous. They do not even respect the ""priority"" for elite travellers. Poor service."
1019,4042,A horrible crowded airport with more people there waving folk off than flying. A seething mass of unorganized humanity crammed into a medium sized airport. As a venue for the A380 boarding is a nightmare.
1020,4044,"Worst immigration ever, took over an hour in line and that was after having to fight other people just to get in line"
1021,4046,"It's great Tulum is opening an airport also, because CUN is stretched thin in terms of space and resources. The terminal is total chaos and each gate is too small to accommodate the number of passengers for the large jets. The general purpose lounge isn't much better."
1022,4052,"Again, Cancun airport is mildly boring for where it is, and getting into the airport is honestly a pain. They have a tendency to change gates left and right.."
1023,4055,"What to expect in November 2015: Slow check in with only two Volaris counters. Security check by hand, the X-Ray machines out of service. Very bad terminal facilities, thanks to the government company that runs the airport (ASA), at lest they put some chairs (12) in the pre-documentation area. Good Wi-Fi, specially with TELMEX, you need password. Small but 2 good food stores usually with sandwiches or groceries, don't expect a full restaurant or tables to seat for eat/drink."
1024,4056,"Defective air conditioning No Wi-Fi, no comfort in the boarding room."
1025,4082,"Long wait at immigration, really congested airport, lines at restaurznts/shops, overpriced food. I would actively avoid flying through MEX"
1026,4085,"After having used LHR, Mexico's AICM feels small and old, for a national gateway airport, and services are also lacking quality"
1027,4091,"One of the worst and ugliest airports i ever seen. Design, service, chaotic, rude staff and police officers."
1028,4097,Traveler beware of this airport and the customs inspections. They will find any way they can to seize your belonging and force you to pay a “tax”. If I were in your shoes I wouldn't come here.
1029,4098,"very bad airport, especially terminal C where Volaris lands. document check for a domestic flight upon arrival and nobody wants to speak English"
1030,4109,There was no passport control for outgoing international flights. The VIP lounge in the international terminal is very crowded and with very limited food offerings.
1031,4110,"There is just no space to accommodate thousands of passengers. The passport control line was long but at least was moving. The customs line was out of control in terms of length and the pace it was moving. The airport staff finally gave up and created new lines out of existing lines. That made many passengers who have been in line for a long, long time angry. Also, the customs line one through the baggage claim area leaving no room for passengers who need to get to the baggage claim to get reclaim their bags."
1032,4122,TINY. Only 1 terminal. No shops and hardly any places to buy food (Only 2) Only sold packaged sandwiches
1033,4126,Security is ridiculous. Im sure if I look on Ebay Ill see all the things they took from me that day.
1034,4127,"Huge immigration queues, chaotic terminal. Allow to spend at least 1.5 hours in the terminal on arrival"
1035,4128,Just run from the timeshare salespeople. Go through the last two rooms and go directly out to the rental car counter or outside
1036,4153,"The only plus is that it is a small airport. The rest are only minuses. Public transport practically does not exist (what exists is as black as a fingernail). The airport taxi takes passengers by the nose. There is a price at the counter, but in the taxi there is another, higher, unofficial price. Boring airport. Duty-free with exaggerated prices, when it should be duty-free (cheaper). And so on"
1037,4154,the best airport
1038,4157,"idiotic unnecessary passport control for transit passengers at the border, half-empty cafes, scorched chivas in dudes"
1039,4158,"Worst airport I've ever been - duty free shops full with fake Chivas, idiotic rules for foreign transit passengers, cattle in airport aviation security"
1040,4162,"Too small, no public transport, check in very slow, serucity check also slow and they are not polite. There is only one cafe shop. You cannot go through the security check any time, just 1 hour before the flight. No enough seats, but they finally accept the mobile boarding card."
1041,4166,"Smallest capital international airport ive ever seen. Its so small and slow, the guy at Information is sleeping (7.1.21, 16:00) at the desk. This airport does not allow any digital check in (Star Alliance: Swiss/Austrian/Lufthansa) Forget about luggage storage or fast drop. I expect heavy handling if there is more than one flight per hour departing, long queues. No covid testing possibilities No Police officers wear masks so the Montenegro Covid Policy is not enforced. Wild dogs living around the entrance. No public posted opening times „The opening hours are in accordance with departures from the Airport Podgorica.“ So what? 5m before? 1h before? At 5:28 at least its not open. 05:41 a female police officer entered. 05:42 a maintenance guy opened, but so unwelcoming you have to guess if you can enter or not. No surprise, they didnt start boarding on time Security check allows extra scanning of fluids, no EU 1l Limit Business Lounge denied me access even having Business Class Ticket and its always closed. Its guarded by 1-2 mostly sleeping employees or they are on their phone. Handling does not even print the class on the boarding pass Thats why Handling doesnt board business class first Almost completely useless"
1042,4170,"Beautiful country, but this airport doesn't meet the requirements of the remaining vast development of the country, especially the seaside with its state of the art hotspots. The airport is a waiting room, not more."
1043,4171,SMALL AIRPORT BUT DIRTY AND NOT MODERN AS BELGRADE AIRPORT..............................................................................................................................................................................
1044,4172,One of the Worst if not The worst I have ever seen. not enough seats no café no Bar no Restaurant. and rude Police staff
1045,4173,"After my Air Serbia flight got cancelled from Tivat, the Air Serbia booth wasn't sufficient to solve the issues of the passengers from the cancelled plane. It was chaotic. No information on rebooking, had to wait like 3 or more hours until got told to come back tomorrow because that day no more planes are available. The taxis at the airport try to scam you with triple prices (35 euros instead of 10). There are like 6 seats to sit, the WiFi is not working everywhere, there is no shop after the security check/passport control. My rebooked flight was delayed on the next day and were no option to buy food while waiting at the gates. During boarding, they make you stand on the tarmac in like 35 degrees until the other half of the passengers get on board. I was kicked from the cafe because I didn't buy anything just wanted to sit."
1046,4174,"Horrible small, cramped airport. There are at most 50 seats in the departure hall. Just quiet horror. The luggage was brought onto the wrong plane and the flight was delayed. In general, U ZH A S."
1047,4182,"Worst airport ever. Trying to rob tourists like everywhere in Morocco - the most expensive airport food I've ever seen (>NYC or Europe). Basically no AC plugs in the lounges; got my boarding pass/passport checked like 7 times; had some weird ""check"" after passport control where a guy with hardly comprehensible English started asking how much money do I have in Eur, how much in dirham, if I had a camera - weird questions to be asked, especially I fail to see why any financial stuff would matter given that I am a European (which they know from the excessive passport checking) flying back to Europe."
1048,4183,"Worst of the airports I have ever visited. Huge prices, only several shops and everyone wants to fool you and get more money. Taxi service is awful."
1049,4184,"Don't accept on-line check in boarding pass. They send you back from line to check in counter for boarding pass for carry on luggage. Only one security stand open. After 30 minutes when line was terribly long they opened two more. Only 4 stands of passport control open. 2,5 hour not enough to get to the plane. People running to plane. Insane scenes. Typical situation at this airport. Terrible experience for the beginning and end of journey to this beautiful country."
1050,4185,"over 1,5h to get through passport control. The same situation on the way back (but over 2,5h to get through security and passpor tcontrol) (plus long line to security). Don't accept printed boarding pass. They send you back to check-in for regular boarding pass even if you travel only with carry on. People running to plane. Very unpleasent situation. Nobody cares. Morocco is a great country, but first impression and last impression is terrible! As I heard from Wizzair crew they wait every time for passengers due to long ques. All they have to do is just to hire 5 more people and they will earn more monay on duty free shops and restaurants - people will have more time before flight departure."
1051,4186,"The security and immigration process is not convenient and extremely slow compared to the low number of passangers. What would they do in case of higher volume of passengers? It is not signed at the immigration that it is must to fill-in a small out-going-paper-document, that is why many people have to do it in the queue, or after they went to the officer at the desk. After all, there is an other check of the passport, from 2 steps the desk...why? Other thing is, that every people have to take off their shoes, however it is not needed in other airports in case of you have just a running/sport show, for example."
1052,4195,"It's a bad experience through and through. In the domestic terminal, there was pooled water on the floor of the men's room. No outlets. Extremely limited seating. Poor signage. Far away from the city with limited public transit options of getting there. Super inefficient so you'll probably be delayed."
1053,4198,"Arrive as early as possible, the Airport security will check your passport every 10 meters you walk, and it will take time, the Passport security for stamping the passport will take more than 1h in line. The wifi doesn't work, everything is charged in EURO and they charge really expensive."
1054,4199,"The new terminal 1 in Casablanca Airport is very nice but the problem of slow immigration still did there not yet solved, they need to add more police staff or to add e-gates for Moroccan passport holders to make it more faster."
1055,4202,Horrible security checks in such a small stupid airport women took my water away leaving me to buy a very horrible warm water from the stupid cafe that cost about £2 would not recommend
1056,4203,Horrible airport stupid security checks water got taken away no wifi half the people dont listen almost missed my flight
1057,4206,"Shit, dirt and malaria"
1058,4207,"Sooo slow. I almost lost the multipurpose tool, I had to smell it saying that it was a gift from my grandfather and that I have taken it through airports all over the world without a problem. Everything was super slow, lucky that I went with time. Besides, they didn't allow online check-in..."
1059,4210,"Getting to the airport: no fast Train, only connected by regional train. Good luck passing through the hell of cheating taxi drivers charing you 50x as usual to get from/to airport. Government doesnt care. Taxis park *in* the only path to the entrance, making the parking lot useless and blocking everyone else. Horrible chaotic organisation inside the airport. Ground crew is completly clueless, the „fast“ track is unorganized making it effectively useless. Staff barely speaks english or french and just waves a bit with their hands to tell you something. Signs are missing or misleading. Customs are laughing and chatting, not a professional crew. A second improvised passport control makes bottle necks. Bathroom smelly and not cleaned. No Lounge for Star Alliance Airlines. Filled out suggestion/complaint form. Other than one email „we take it seriously“ they dont answer to any following email with specific suggestions. Appears that the people in charge have no idea how to run an airport. Better pick Rabat or Casablanca."
1060,4212,"Staff very chatty, which caused it to take very long time to get through. The lady at the sim shop attempted to steal ab family members sim"
1061,4214,"Chaotic organization! Things already started in the departure hall: the display showed counters 6-12 for check-in. At the counters there was Check In for Lufthansa, Austrian and Swiss, and a counter for Business. Suddenly the counter clerk stands up and wants to send us away because he only checks in for business. We refused because the advert said Economy. Even a superior had no chance of driving us away. There is a similar picture at the Nebenschlater, where they want to send away customers who fly to Vienna and only check in Munich. But that was nowhere! So everyone stayed where they were and check-in continued. After boarding, when everyone was on the plane and ready, they suddenly said that the ground crew had loaded one piece of luggage too many and now they have to check each individual piece to see whether it can be assigned to a passenger. That took an hour! Last but not least, we had to wait another 20 minutes because the airspace over Marseille was crowded. Organizing does not mean being authoritarian, ignorant and arrogant!! Marrakesh - shame about you and the behavior of your staff!!!"
1062,4216,very long security checks: planned 2h and was still nearly just on time brand new hall but poor indications: had to go out to the parking and come back to the departures hall to find the car rental agencies unreliable wifi
1063,4219,bad airport small airport needs more work ...................................................................................................................................................... ..........................................................................................................................................................................................................
1064,4220,2 flights per day ;)
1065,4227,"Filthy, badly organised and the staff are utterly useless. The security crew were fighting amongst themselves on arrival! The tannoy announcements are so loud as to burst ones eardrums and the toilets were all broken."
1066,4240,quite small but consequently no waiting for security or check-in
1067,4246,"A very cute domestic airfield in Myanmar. It does not offer much, yet you got a nice view over the apron with a high peak of aircraft movements between 4-5 pm."
1068,4247,"Pleasant staff and efficient enough - but - no indicator boards about departures, garbled announcements, no clear directions to planes ( had to check with FA if we were on right plane) - and very smelly toilets."
1069,4248,Terribly basic airport with very limited facilities. There were no display panels - the flight number was written on a piece of paper stuck to the wall. There was no PA - announcements were made (in Burmese only) by ground staff shouting at the top of their voice.
1070,4249,"Very small airport. Arrived on a 20 minute flight from Mandalay, departed for a 1 hour flight to Yangon. There is wifi available, but it takes forever to connect and the connection is shaky. Some food options. Check-in was done by tour guide for our group and everyones suitcases made it where they were supposed to. Short walk from the terminal to the planes. It gets the job done even though it seems to operate on organized chaos. Bathrooms are better once you get past security, but that's not saying much."
1071,4250,"Small airstrip with very limited services on offer. There is however a small shop that sells excellent coffee and myanmar wine can be bought from the vineyard's outlet. Also this must be among the last airports in the world, where it is actually possible (and legal) to follow the (limited) traffic right from the tarmarc. As long as you don't walk onto the landig strip or disturb the traffic, nobody will stop you from watching the ATRs land and take off."
1072,4255,"The old domestic terminal at YGN is pretty chaotic and has only basic facilities. Apparently a new terminal will be opened ""soon"""
1073,4257,Was definitely not worth getting to the airport early for our 6am flight as nothing was open (the next flight was not until 8am) for a maximum of 72 passengers. No coffee - not even from a machine. Nowhere to get rid of the remaining khat.
1074,4259,"Review for the national terminal of Yangon Airport (RGN) The national terminal has been built with huge capacities for future growth. While the ground floor waiting space hardly fills up, the first floor stays largely empty. However it is still worth a look for the amazing combination of an operastyle-airport that is filled with smartie-style seats. Additionally a small café up there serves excellent espresso. There is a small shop with a limited selection of burmese newspapers on ground floor, no international papers to be found here."
1075,4260,The airport is more beautiful than I expected.
1076,4263,"New airport. No Business class lounge but there are signs for the lounge. No working ""NAC"" (Namibian Airports Company) WiFi. There was signal but no internet connection."
1077,4267,"Free WiFi for travellers is non existent, immigration officers tend to be unfriendly an do not bother dealing with the queue when they are busy making up their nails or other important stuff. Restaurants are sparse an chances are, that when you order 3 things from their menu they ran our of 2 of them."
1078,4278,"Flights delayed due to runway congestion. TG319 was 1.5 hours delayed from takeoff and landing. Circled Nepali airspace before given go ahead to land. Poor visa on arrival process, wasted up to 1 hour, baggage is already off the carousel by time passengers get out. Chaotic, unnecessary metal check after arrival and exiting customs. Overall this airport should be avoided once the new Pokhara Airport is opened. Unlikely to see improvements due to overcapacity."
1079,4279,"Nothing recommend facilities very poor Run way taxi area floor cracked Airport waiting area dirty and nasty Bathroom poor and dirty Facilities very poor 100% Why do you have to steal things from others luggage??? It might just seem a small piece of jewellery that you can sell it and get few money, but the one you are stealing from, they have got their emotions attached to it.. it was a jewellery that got stolen was from their wedding.."
1080,4280,"Very confusing process for getting visa upon arrival; absolute chaos when 4 flights arrived at once. Took a long time to figure out where to go or what was going on. No food upon arrival aside from small cafe down the road. Good retail when leaving, though."
1081,4281,"Visa on arrival process a pain - queues for the processing machines, desk then only took cash despite having a sign for credit cards. Once visa obtained the children had to be processed at the gratis desk while adults went to a separate desk - joy of double queuing! It really doesn't need to be made this difficult!"
1082,4283,its amazing Airport and most dangerous airport in the world....you will experiance the thrilling flight......very helpful...honest and brave people live here....who can climb Everest without oxygen.
1083,4292,"Old and derelict, slow scanning equipment at passport control, too few toilets and takes ages to get the luggage on the belt."
1084,4299,"When the weather goes wrong, Schipol is terrible with substantial delays. Should avoid if possible. Deicing cuts average number of flights down to 10 per hour..."
1085,4303,Airport Looks like a temporary building. Long Wait times coming into the country. Departing looks just as bad. The boarding area looked like a bunch of cattle pens
1086,4310,we had to sit on the plane for more than 20 minutes at the gate before we were allowed to get off. then we have to wait another 20 minutes for our suitcases. this all had to do with a lack of sufficient airport staff
1087,4320,"Old, dead quiet after 8pm, no decent seating area, only dirty machine coffee, etc."
1088,4323,"No KLM Amsterdam links now so I have not used this airport in many years , shame ."
1089,4324,Verry nice airport.
1090,4337,Very cramped airport with limited customs area. No places to eat or sit down. The taxi service is plentiful but very aggressive drivers trying to get you to go in their taxi.
1091,4338,"Unfortunately, the reconstruction of SXM after the 2017 hurricane Irma has been caught up in politics, and not much development has occurred. There are very basic services."
1092,4339,"At the time of writing this, half the airport was going under renovation. Lines were long and once you got through everything it was overcrowded and very hot. American Airlines workers had no idea what they were doing and made us wait for over an hour. They just sat there on their desk and when asked why it took so long they said they forgot to call the busses and set up the flight....."
1093,4343,"Princess Juliana airport was destroyed after all those hurricanes in September 2017, it is recovering."
1094,4351,French !!
1095,4355,"(Regional terminal) Auckland's domestic terminal has every amenity you may need - good food, retail and free water and weighing stations and the like; however I can never shake the feeling of how incredibly dull the experience of waiting for your flight is in an enormous hall with no windows. I sure can't wait until a new terminal is built for the second runway - the current one was originally intended for cargo regardless."
1096,4379,"Airport Terminal is closed between flights, so don't bother showing up to early! Airport website does not list opening /closing hours - show about an hour prior to departure. Grab a seat by the window or door as the foil lining in the temporary terminal buildiong blocvks cell phone signals really well. Cafe was also closed and still dirty from it was last open."
1097,4393,"Clean, local airport that has most of what you require. Good staff"
1098,4401,Watch out for queues at security on Saturdays. 45mins to get to security then 15mins to get to passport control. The airport has outgrown itself.
1099,4416,Plane war parked at a position that's usually used for international flights. Other end of airport from AirNZ Lounge. No facility apart from two toilets after security.
1100,4420,What’s the point of priority baggage when once of your bags is first off and the other is last off?
1101,4421,"This is a 'part-time' international airport. The check-in desks are shared among the few airlines (other than Air New Zealand) that bother with this airport and only open three hours ahead of flight time. The internationals gates and the airline lounges open around the same time. So if you have a mid-late afternoon flight and have checked out of your hotel or finished your meeting mid-morning, find somewhere else to kill some hours (Te Papa is always great!) or you're going to be uncomfortable and bored out of your brain waiting to check in for your flight."
1102,4431,I would say the airport is not so security conscious for arriving passengers because from the plane I just walked straight to the car park apart from those who had to take their bags at the baggage carousel. And not so many gates unlike the Airport at Lagos.
1103,4435,"Awful airport. Air conditioning became functional just 2-3 years ago. People are trying to get money out of you from check-in to boarding. I once said something the officials didn't like and they asked me to open my baggage. They then proceeded to search intentionally and incredibly slowly, holding up everyone else in the queue and causing me to miss my flight. I'd guess that >70% of all flights from this airport are delayed. Speakers are old and very muffled. You cannot understand anything the speakers say. Lounges are atrocious. You need to pay money to get more than 1 snack!!! (On top of the entrance fee). Everything is ridiculously marked up (guessing 700% of the normal price). The only reason why I did not give this airport 1 star is because, compared to other African airports, Murtala Muhammad isn't half bad."
1104,4436,"Upon landing we were directed to a parking bay on the old ""B"" terminal, shut down and had to wait for a tug to drag us literally 2 meters into our final parking position. After about 15 minutes wait the captain announced that our ""normal"" parking bay (A42) was now available and that we had to sit tight for another hour whilst the Nigerians found a tug to take our plane across the apron to the ""A"" terminal for deplaning."
1105,4437,"Make sure to be well tempered with thick fur if you do not want to bribe the officials. Usually a few dollars will do fine, but as this system is something one should not suppert, just bring plenty of extra time at the airport. In the best case you have somebody in Nigeria to call (police / government / transport agency or similar) so the officials get afraid and let you free. Not something I would suggest for beginners. Just avoid this Airport and use Abuja ABJ instead and fly domestic into Lagos LOS."
1106,4438,"Awful airport No Wi-Fi available except for the lounges Very poorly maintained facilities Everyone is trying to get money from you at every step, from check-in to the customs"
1107,4439,"Absolute worst airport on the continent. I've been to various airports in Africa, but MMI takes the cake. Nothing works, electricity supply is (hopefully) not grid-power, staff are there to fleece you, immigration ""rules""change constantly - a ""STR"" visa which was valid at a prior entry, no longer ""works"". The pits!"
1108,4442,"Among a couple of 100 airports I know, this is definitely the worst. Some ""special"" people are permanentely guided around you when you queue and the staff in general is something between inefficient and completely useless. Try to avoid this airport, if you can!"
1109,4443,"Muritala Mohammed Airport in my own view is one of the worst airport in the world. The moment you get off the plane and enter the jetway, the first person to welcome you is the heat. It is like as if you are entering an oven. Having left the jet way, you will have to battle the heat when going through the medical check as well as the security check. The Air conditioners are too weak to cool the scorching heat. After passing the immigration checks, other airlines will have to wait for passangers of other airlines to claim their baggages before they can reclaim theirs and you will have to battle the security guys asking for bribes. Unlike Dubai and Heathrow where trolley is for free, you pay to use the trolley. Its so disgusting"
1110,4458,"A compact and fairly efficient airport in itself. However, it has major issues with public transportation, so most of the time you're forced to take a 20 EUR taxi. Also, the wifi connection is ridiculously bad and you only get it for 30 minutes. No smoking facilities on the airside."
1111,4468,Good but could get better gates
1112,4470,"Very small, one shop with limited selection. Gates were easy to access and queing was fine. Not enough seating in the gate wating area. Disorganised and unprofessional boarding procedures and staff."
1113,4471,"10ms, 8 gr"
1114,4472,Weird airport Wayfinding is not good. But once you’ve finally found your way you have to go out of the airport and re-check in before connecting to other flights. Security with all ‘new’ passengers took pretty long.
1115,4473,Ended up being outside the terminal when having a connecting flight. Very bad signs at the airport.
1116,4476,"Useless for international to domestic traveling, due to the customs setup. They should have an option without new security for passengers with carry-on"
1117,4487,"Bagade takes 30 minnuets after pasagers has comed to bagbelt. Only one plane and its take so long time. Many groundhanlers on work, but only one work."
1118,4488,"This airport does not seem to care about ""priority"" tags on luggage. Had to wait until almost all luggage were out before mine arrived last night. And several priority pieces were among the last delivered. Arriving the airport the check-in area can easily get pretty crowded with buses arriving from several places at once. Also getting your luggage sent might be a hassle. Finding service staff to help you at these times close to impossible. Limited and expensive food options. No lounge facilities. I have only domestic flights here. International flights mostly charter. Basic airport that unluckily is my ""home"" airport."
1119,4495,Haugesund Airport is poor and shitty.
1120,4496,"Small, but okay :)"
1121,4500,VERY basic facilities. Had to wait until almost departure time before immigration people started work.
1122,4501,http://flightdiary.net/add-flight
1123,4504,"All function until you get a trouble with your flight, luggage. Do not expect any help. They keep to misinform you to avoid extra work."
1124,4509,"Basically a duty free shop which offers flights as well. Norwegians love it, but I think it's annoying... Quite personal atmosphere."
1125,4518,"It's a magical place, probably one of the most exotic places to visit."
1126,4519,Nice place.
1127,4520,"I general it is a perfectly fine airport, but they are impressively slow at delivering checked luggage. On my most recent trip i waited for 50 minutes for them to move 20 pieces of checked luggage 50 meters."
1128,4521,"Had to present ID at the gate after security and before gate opened. PA was at times uninterpretable, causing confusion."
1129,4524,Very small airport for my taste.
1130,4527,very little but efficient airport. very crowded place before boarding.
1131,4546,"Airport is far away from the centre (like all Oslo airports). Transfer is very expensive. On the other hand, if you rent a car, the airport is right next to the highway to Oslo. Security check took 20 minutes of waiting in line. It didn't seem like they were ready for two departing flights."
1132,4549,"Ok airport, but the food options are bad."
1133,4556,"I think this is the smallest airport I've ever been to. Hard to find electric socket, hard to find place to seat, seems in the middle of nowhere. However, I must admit that WiFi quality is very high and workers at this airport are more than nice."
1134,4557,A glorified bus terminal. Not particularly inviting; and very far from Oslo city centre. If you're heading into Oslo -- fly elsewhere.
1135,4565,"Shame, but not workinig jetbridge - because of not qualifide personal or technical issues is a common ""wellcome"" in SVG"
1136,4572,Quite small airport if seen with internationally eyes. No lounges and few Food services. Good fast track service.
1137,4577,"crowded, bad information policy, hilarious gate assigning. just two crowded shops, toilets dirty and with queues. never expected such a bad airport in a contry like Norway, where usually all airports are really efficient and comfortable"
1138,4580,Beware: no facilities to claim your tax free. Tax free shopping in Tromsø is a joke because you can‘t get export stamp from customs
1139,4582,"Tromso Airport was near to the central. It took merely about ten minutes travel by Airport Express Bus. It had fix schedule time of the bus. After arriving the airport, the departure hall for checking-in was the same area of the exit of the baggage reclaim. The baggage reclaim was a public area with a few seats which were the only rest place before the security check. The check-in counters were designed as bag drop only. The whole preparation procedure needed to be completed from the self-check-in kiosks. The hall only provided ATMs, a few service counters and a post stand. It can be recognized as a simple function airport. After completing check-in on the ground floor, departure was on the first level. There was restricted area on the first floor, where passengers carried out the security check. Due to the nighttime of the flight, there were only a few officers. Passports weren’t required throughout the whole process even at the boarding gate. The departure lounge obtained an aisle with about ten boarding gates. It was a totally tiny airport that I had barely seen."
1140,4598,"90 minutes waiting in line for passport control, complicated connection to wifi, no electric or usb plugs, no public transport at night, otherwise nice modern building"
1141,4600,"I was traveling from Pakistan Karachi to Frankfurt transit through Muscat transit time was 13 houre but, on Muscat airport airport official haven't give me hotel or accommodation for this long stay if anybody traveling by Oman let me tell you if you are on economy and expecting them to do something for you during transit time then you are wrong. Food was good crew was also good but, journey with Oman air was difficult."
1142,4601,"I was traveling from Pakistan Karachi to Frankfurt transit through Muscat transit time was 13 houre but, on Muscat airport airport official haven't give me hotel or accommodation for this long stay if anybody traveling by Oman let me tell you if you are on economy and expecting them to do something for you during transit time then you are wrong. Food was good crew was also good but, journey with Oman air was difficult. They are not helping if you don't know anybody on top post when departing from Pakistan."
1143,4617,"They did not let us leave in Isb airport, Worst experience from flying Isb to Beijing, the flight was shown from Karachi to Beijing but now they always routed this flight from Islamabad to beijing and keep you inside the plan for 2 hours, too bad , i will prefer to fly directly from my city Karachi"
1144,4621,Passport queues huge. Then there is another long rechecking queue ... didn't see the need for rechecking.
1145,4630,Check in is a hell on Lahore airport as there are more Protocol pushed passengers than normal passengers. Even Emirates Business and Gold lane is also like a Bus Stand Lane on Lahore Airport. I think Emirates has no better staff to post on Lahore Airport.
1146,4631,Its hell getting to Lahore airport as there are several lanes terminating to the airport security but only 1 lane passes through security which creates the most of the Chaos. I would rather drive 5 hours to Islamabad then to attempt Lahore Airport. Designed and built very bad and w/o any research.
1147,4639,"Immigration, baggage claim and customs are so poor. It takes an hour to clear whereas these are just within 400 meters from each other. Its always a nightmare to travel to Multan."
1148,4648,Peshawar Airport one of best attactive airport of Pakistan.
1149,4655,Sialkot Airport is first airport in Pakistan which are totally controlled by Silakot Exporters... Very Good and excellent.
1150,4656,goooooooooooooood
1151,4662,"We had a big delay because of technical problems of Wingo, but there were no options in the airport to spend the time... just a little coffee and no shops. Internet did not work. Tocumen (PTY) and Marcos Gelabert (PAC) are much better options."
1152,4663,"Out of the city, it is the smallets one with no facilities. There were not even taxis when we went out, so we had to wait almost halg an hour for them. Tocumen (PTY) and Marcos Gelabert (PAC) are much better options."
1153,4674,"Avoid transiting through here. This is a horrible airport in so many ways. The terminal is humid and dirty and the food, being of limited options, is overpriced and disgusting. Staff treat you horribly and there are very few seats, and there are only 30 minutes of free WiFi. Avoid coming here at all costs, you won’t like it."
1154,4678,Old & in need of a freshen up.
1155,4680,A shed
1156,4689,"No need to show up early at this airport. No lounge, no food after security, just a vending machine or 2, but those at least have beer. Check in was super fast, and security was one of the quickest in the world. 20 minutes before boarding is a great time to show up here."
1157,4692,Hardly any amenities. The vending machines that were there only worked 25%-50% of the time. Security was good and so was checkin
1158,4696,"I had very good times in Cuzco! The airport is nice, not an A-class but acceptable. Friendly people. I'll shall return."
1159,4697,"Small, uncomfortable terminal, extremely hot, without drinking water, if you need water you will have to pay a lot in the few shops in the terminal, few VIP lounges."
1160,4701,"The only good thing about this airport is the immigration, but only about 88% of the time. This airport is very old, and very inconvenient to get to and from, especially for tourists in the Miraflores or Barranco neighborhoods. It is an easy 45 minutes if you are lucky to and from the airport, but is often an hour or more. The check in area is putrid, with the airlines (LATAM) making you do everything for your own checked bags. They sometimes cordon off the check in areas, and do not let people pass, often telling you to get to the other side, by taking the stairs, crossing the airport, and then taking the stairs back down. security is half and half. At times they just stop letting people through security for 10-20 minutes, while all the employees take a break. When you land, and exit the airport, you will be hounded by taxi drivers left, right, behind, in front of you. Even once you get through the doors, they will still follow you through, and attempt to talk to you about why they are better( More expensive) than the uber you ordered."
1161,4703,"The airport is a little small for a capital airport... But once again, it's a good one when you have to leave Lima. It's a totally different matter for people who arrive... Especially for what concerns baggage claiming. We waited 20 minutes at the terminal, and we were the only ones around for a national flight, I can't really imagine why it was so long to take out our baggage (in Cusco it was already there when we left the airplane)."
1162,4714,"The airport is messy, old and really unorganized. The check-in is chaotic, nobody follows the line and they treat foreigners in really rudely. They are just keep sending you from counters to counters and they are extremely slow. I went to check in and I was there on time, but I had to wait in the line more than half an hour and there were only a few people in front of me. There is no internet, they do not have any restaurant in the terminal only some small counters with old, oily things. Even if you have roaming, the connection is really bad at the airport, so it is not working. They have a very high terminal fee for international passengers."
1163,4717,Airport closes after last flight. Reopen at 4.30am. No one allow to stay in terminal when close. Bench provided outside terminal. Free wifi near departure hall. 24hrs convenient stall at arrival hall. Slow immigration process.
1164,4718,"Bacolod Silay Airport is in dire need of an upgrade, as there are only 3 airbridges and the terminal is quite small. Due to various delays from MNL, 4 airplanes landed within 32 minutes of each other and the departure area was packed with about 700+ passengers, some sitting on the floor and blocking access to the queue of the boarding gate. They do not have proper restaurants compared to say, ILO but mostly food stalls with a handful of tables in the pre-departure area. They do have Spa Natura that offers massages (for a fee) which is a good way to spend those extra hours which are caused by delays coming in from MNL. They also have a children's playground area but the lounge was inoperational."
1165,4730,"What a debacle this place is. Stood in line for 90 minutes as PAL ground agents said the system was ""down"". Staff sat there chatting whilst one was actually asleep. With 60 minutes to STD the supervisor decided to initiate manual check in of nearly 200 passengers, what a joke! Needless to say this delayed the flight and I missed my connection in Manila. Once airside the departure lounge was rammed, standing room only. Couldn't get to any food or drink outlets due to long queues and the fact that they were all understaffed. What lounge??? This is what happens when you have people who pretend at playing the airport game. It turns into a pile of 5h1t!"
1166,4732,"To do, nothing at all but joust except a little store."
1167,4735,The airport has a runway of 1700 meters which is very short for jet planes. There are no international flights from this airport. Departure terminal and arrival are in 2 different locations. There is no public transport to/from the airport. You can take a tricycle to/from the jetty port or take a shared van to the jetty port.
1168,4736,Craziest airport I've landed at. Love the outdoor departure lounge!
1169,4741,"very long queue for departure tax (even when it is already included in your ticket), then further queue for immigration with 2/3 counters open for hundreds of passengers."
1170,4746,"Unfortunately, the airport disappointed me in many respects. Exit fees that no one informs about, old terminal, dirty and thieving staff. Average experience."
1171,4749,Very bad ergonomics. Almost zero well known retailers and environment is quite bad when you compare it to other airports. Airport staff took 13 minutes to check us in. Otherwise seamless.
1172,4756,I love this Aiport <33
1173,4757,No WiFi!
1174,4758,No WiFi
1175,4761,"Very basic airport, with limited and poor quality food options. Two flights are enough for the departure hall to be packed."
1176,4769,Worst airport I've ever seen. It's half way under construction and they will only let you in 3 hours before your flight.
1177,4771,Very small airport!
1178,4773,"To change airport Terminals at MNL expect 3+ hours! The bus ""shuttle"" only runs once an hour or less, thus overcrowded. TAKE A TAXI INSTEAD!"
1179,4776,It's time for the Philippines to get a new airport and have it managed by aviation professionals instead of retired generals.
1180,4777,"The only thing that could improve this airport is a new airport, run by aviation professionals and not ex-military officers."
1181,4778,"The stupidest airport and crew of the world. The lounge for business class is also the worst one I ever seen - no space, no variety of food and drinks…"
1182,4780,Airport was HOT. Should increase the aircond. not many F&B options inside the departure gates so eat before gp through security & immigration.
1183,4784,"I have been to many airport but I think one of my worst experince was in PPS airport. The terminal is dirty and really unorganized, the check-in agents are rude and really unhelpful and if they see you are a foreigner, they treat you in a relly bad way. You need to pay a terminal fee, but they do not provide anything back. The security is not checking anything much, so I do not even find the place safe. There are limited food and cafe options, no wifi and it is very crowded."
1184,4786,"Overcrowded, not enough seats, not enough standing room, hot, aircon seemingly not working. no departure board, inaudible tannoy announcements. Our flight was delayed by an hour and no information was given. Thank God we finally got away."
1185,4787,Basic rural airport. Nice location next to the sea!
1186,4788,Regional Airport of Eastern Visayas. This airport needs to upgrade its facilities and expand as an international airport
1187,4792,Really nice airport :)
1188,4793,small.. too small.. ;/
1189,4794,Nice free wifi
1190,4803,"The worst airport. Even domestic flights, which have not been repaired for a year now, will be corralled upon arrival."
1191,4804,"Look for more at Dnischensky airport: passengers from non-EU flights are accepted into the pens, you can spend 2 hours on border control, there are no toilets in the area, in 2021 construction is still ongoing"
1192,4805,"The worst Airport in Poland. Security service is extremely slow. Staff is lazy, rude and uneducated to the nowadays laws."
1193,4806,"It's an airport caricature, not a genuine airport. Driving up to the disembarkation terminal is not allowed (!) - it's strictly for buses only. The area has high curbs everywhere, making it difficult or even impossible to navigate with a pram and larger luggage. It's a disaster."
1194,4808,"Very cheap and very bad airport. Dirty toilets, unpleasant staff (security check is a road through hell)."
1195,4810,"Very long waiting time for passport clearence, because in the same time 4 aircrafts from different countries had arrived, and there too many people."
1196,4812,The Airport was too full. There were many flights but all in one gate-zone. The air was very stuffy and even the employees could hardly get through the crowds. Also the security check point was soo full.
1197,4813,"Terrible quality. Up to 3 gates next to each other, 3 departures at the same time and a tiny waiting room. Terminal under construction"
1198,4814,"Reconstruction zone forced to walk outside through muddy ground, awful solution. Not so nice security check, airport far away from anywhere with poor public transport."
1199,4820,"One of the slowest airports. They have time for everything. Be-boarding very slow (missing busses and filling busses to max), waiting for baggages takes ages. Mostly it is crowded and limited space to seat."
1200,4821,"The toilets at this airport are terrible. Small, dirty, and smelly. This is one and the biggest disadvantage."
1201,4823,"This is the most expensive airport in the world! 0.7L bottle of water €2.50, small latte coffee €4, sandwich €7.50. All of this in Poland! The Internet is horrible too. Given the prices and flaky services, one of the worst airports I've been to."
1202,4827,New super terminal
1203,4829,The new terminal is really nice with free Wi Fi. Good access to the airport from car park and ect.
1204,4832,ok t3
1205,4833,Small but very good airport .
1206,4837,"The major issue with this airport is that it's not used that much, since there are couple of flights during the day. Thus, getting to the airport with public transportation is a bit of a hassle - I couldn't find any bus/train which was ok for my 3pm LOT flight to Warsaw. After getting to the airport there is heavy security control, maybe they are bored but went through all my belongings piece by piece. And after that you're on the bright side already, right? But.... nah. Smoking cabin, placed in the very center of non schengen zone looks like abandoned, stinks and is full of cigs leftovers falling out from ashtray. Business lounge is usually closed, I needed to ask the guy from the nearby cafe to call BL Lady and she came after 15 mins or so to open it. Later not better at all - she couldn't check me in, while she handled it it turned out there is no Wifi at all. Food and beverages selection is another story, way below decent, but at least someting was there. I think the worst airport in PL to fly from. And I used most of them. Cheers."
1207,4838,Unbelievably small non-Schengen glass box (its difficult to name it as a zone). Very uncomfortable even with only one A320 departing at that time.
1208,4848,the worst airport in Poland and probably one of the worst in the world. They had three flights close to each other so all of them were late only because of organization mess. Our flight started one hour after time so lot of passengers lost their connecting flights in Frankfurt Airport . We had to run to catch our flight. It is not the first time how they work like that. It is rather regular practice. They do not care about passengers
1209,4849,the worst airport in Poland a probably one of the worsted in the world. When they have 3 flights close to each other for sure everyone will be late. They are no able to start more than one plain per hour. There is business lounge where is nothing. Really nothing to it and nothing to drink
1210,4850,"the worst airport in Poland and their lounge is one of the worst in the world. Rude stuff, unfriendly facilities stupid organization. Huge queues, Hell on earth. Avoid if possible"
1211,4853,"The worst airport in Europe and one of the worst in the world. Inefficient, uncomfortable, with horrible stuff. Long .... very long time to security check even though they have only few flights a day"
1212,4854,"Terrible airport. Everything is wrong but stuff is the worst thing of all. Very rude, unhelpful, the do not care about passengers. Unfortunately I had to use that ""batustan"" airport quite often. Many times heard that someone missed flight because mess in airport. But they do not care very unprofessional ."
1213,4855,"Horror, the worst airport in Europe. We were almost 2 hours before our flight and stayed 1,5 hour to security. We cought our flight only because it was delay. Terrible situations, people were desperated they almost fight to each other. Stuff was rude and unhelpful. The did not care that some passangers may not be able to catch flight because of terrible organization on this airport."
1214,4857,"obmacywanie nieprzyjemne, teraz już są od tego maszyny wszędzie. unpleasant security touching, now they have machines for that everywhere"
1215,4867,Hopeless airport. the staff has too much time due to few planes flying. she is rude and annoying
1216,4869,Worst location ever. No reasonable public transportation. Lady at check in desk was quite helpful. Overdiligent security. Cafés and shops are ok. If it rains you still have to make your way to the aircraft over the apron. You couldn't possibly expect shorter taxi time.
1217,4870,clean and nice
1218,4872,Great airport :))
1219,4874,The new terminal looks preety good
1220,4876,Gotta give one star here because WAW pretend not having a baggage wrapping station is a normal thing and they used the pandemic as an excuse XD
1221,4883,"Extremely rude staff at the security check, being treated like this can't be the standard of any (big European) Airport. I wouldn't recommend Warsaw airport to anyone who is interested in a smooth and comfortable journey. The LOT Lounge is heavily overcrowded and the staff at the entrance is impolite and disinterested."
1222,4885,Took so long to check in bags we almost missed the flight even though we arrived 2hrs before the flight.
1223,4888,"Small, really far with awful transport. When you land you have to walk through all airport oudsite during rain and heavy wind"
1224,4889,"Terrible airport, I've never seen anything like it. Typical Ryanair airport that has nothing to offer, is overcrowded, has hardly any waiting room, toilets, food facilities, etc.."
1225,4890,There are few gates and overall the space is really tight and confusing. Stuff at security check is rude and unhelpful.
1226,4891,"Good transport to Warsaw (bus + train, together 50 mins travel time) available each 1 hour. Okay prices for transport, though the airport bus doesn't offer discounts for students/pupils/elderly etc, only the train does. Very rude security check staff. At the rush hour the queue is quite long, 20-25+ mins. Free wifi for 60 mins, then reconnection available. Pathetic availability of seats in the departure hall, lots of people are forced to stand or sit on the floor. Only one small duty free shop available, in my opinion has fewer fragnance available than other regional airports. Not many souvenirs either (only folk ones, no Warsaw pencils, postcards, bags and so on). Flights took off exactly on time."

1228,4893,"i personalky hate this airport, victim of battle between two owners. overcrowded, no space, no normal shops, ver expensive vs level of service and with most idiotic transfer from city ever"
1229,4894,"Horrible - small, boiling hot, barely any food options and no where to sit! Reasonable duty free though"
1230,4895,"A shop, a café and a Relay : that's it. There's nothing more, passengers are on the ground because there are no seats..."
1231,4907,We were waiting 30 min for a result of Covid test and then we had to wait for an hour to pass the passport contorl. Automatic gates for passport contorl were closed and people form 4 different planes were waiting for more than hour
1232,4908,"It's a small airport. Need to go down the stairs, take a bus and so on. Not so much to offer when departing as it is a small terminal. Security fine. Everything else ok."
1233,4910,Should be closed! Insane security control probably they all not like cosmeticks. Amateur crew at the check in. Unfortunately highly not recommended.
1234,4913,The thing about small airports is that everyone treats you like a person and not a commodity. This is what it is like in Zielona Góra (IEG)
1235,4918,Good facilities check in car rentals good gates but very rushed security and passport control was busy
1236,4926,Delay about half an hour due to missing airport buses. Long standing in the queue at the gate. Half of seats behind security check not available due to coronavirus measures.
1237,4930,"Dirty, overcrowded , disorganised, understaffed. As the islands main gateway , this shambles of an airport is not showing off how fantastic the island actually is."
1238,4944,"Terrible airport, very far from the city, the roads to get there are terrible, the staff are terrible, the security staff are terrible, the wifi is terrible, there is no restaurant in good condition, the bathrooms were very dirty."
1239,4947,"IN APPROACH IS VERY TURBULENT WHEN THE WIND BLOWS FROM NORTH QUADRANT, AND SOME DAYS WHEN THE WIND FROM SW-W THE AIRPORT IS CLOSED BECAUSE OF FOG AND MIST. LIMITATIONS ON LANDING AND TAKE-OFF WITH Airbus A320, WHICH SOME TIMES OUR BAGS STAY BEHIND."
1240,4949,"WiFi is not free, need to pay. Duty Free store is very small . Food and retailed sevices expensive and poor terminal facilities. Baggagem claim to small and take a long time to get our bags. Long distance from the city of Horta and should be called Castelo Branco Airport."
1241,4956,"Terrible airport, overpacked and a really bad image for any tourist entering in Portugal via this city."
1242,4957,"Lisbon Aiport is currently overloaded and ending up for not providing a quality response to passengers that pass by. Resulting in a extreme disorganization, especially in the Security Check. Last time I've been there it took me 1 hour to pass by the security an extremely slow process, even though I had Fast Check they demand me to go on the normal queue. Not only that the boarding process are getting more slower, the aiport staff itself tries to scam passengers about the cabin luggages, trying to make us pay even knowing the luggages meets the requiriments (most of them). For the past 1 year and half I've had a few problems everytime I come to this aiport. From now on I'll trying as much as possible to avoid this airport and making my stopovers if necessary at OPO (Porto Aiport)."
1243,4959,"The airport is full of homeless immigrants asking for money and sleeping everywhere, leaving a messy and dirty environment. The bathrooms are always dirty and some things are broken."
1244,4963,"Not enough condicions! Poor Wi-fi, no place to eat, baggage claim terrible, theres is nothing to do in this airport. Very confused check-in, people dont respect the line, and there is no people to get information about the flights. When wind blows from north side, you have to take a boat to Faial island to catch the plane to Lisbon , because in Horta airport there a flight almost every day."
1245,4965,"MUITAS ESTRELAS E POUCOS VOOS. FEW FLIGHTS AND MANY STARS. IN APPROACH IS VERY TURBULENT WHEN THE WIND BLOWS FROM SOUTH QUADRANT, WICH BY THE WAY IS PREDOMINANT. THE AIRPORT USES AN ADMINISTRATIVE TIMETABLE (CLOSED FOR LUNCH.)"
1246,4968,Few flights and many stars
1247,4979,"Porto Airport, also known as Francisco Sá Carneiro Airport, has several areas that could benefit from improvements to enhance the passenger experience. One of the primary concerns is the security check process. Currently, passengers are required to remove electronic devices from their bags and place them in separate trays for X-ray scanning. This procedure often leads to delays, discomfort, and the formation of long queues. Many modern airports have adopted advanced 3D X-ray technology, which allows for faster and more precise screening without the need to remove electronics from bags. Unfortunately, Porto Airport, much like Lisbon Airport, has yet to implement such technology, a change that would greatly improve efficiency and passenger convenience. Another significant issue is the limited operating hours of shops and services at the airport. Most facilities close after 10 PM and do not reopen until 5 or 6 AM the following day. This can be particularly inconvenient for passengers with very early morning flights or those arriving late at night. There are limited options for dining, shopping, or even waiting comfortably during these hours. The situation is further exacerbated by the restricted hours of the airport's only VIP lounge, which does not offer extended service to accommodate these passengers. Extending the operating hours of the VIP lounge, at least, would provide a much-needed amenity for travelers during these off-peak times. In summary, while Porto Airport provides a functional and generally satisfactory experience, there are key areas, notably in security screening and facility operating hours, where improvements could significantly enhance the overall experience for travelers."

1249,4993,It's also a military airport so no photos outside airport! and might wait for 20-30min. on the runway till some military plains will land.
1250,5003,Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh yes
1251,5006,"No public transportation in the airport on Sunday. No Uber in the airport,. Can't really walk outside of the airport. If you coming to this airport during sunday, taxi is the only way that you can get out. Which is over price"
1252,5024,Business fast lane at customs was closed had to wait also priority tagged luggage arrived very late after non priorities it took about 40min of waiting at belt 8. Also deboarding was by bus not air bridge
1253,5033,"What a hell to go to the airport with public transport, from the south of the island ! The Reunion authorities must create public shuttles to link the biggest cities to the airport from the first flight of the day until the last flight."
1254,5040,"The only thing that is ""International"" about the airport is it's name. The bad: No parking lot and rude people at security. Very crowded. The good: Once inside the plane the service was good and the stewards were very nice. The rest of the flight was OK."
1255,5041,"Very small airport, bad conditions, no parking for passengers. The terminal is very small, people are very crowded. Few flights, poorly organized staff. The runway is long, this being the only good thing about Bacau airport."
1256,5043,Very poorly organized airport..
1257,5044,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqeWZiRyxF4
1258,5045,"It's the worse I've seen in my entire life. If you can - avoid it. It's even worse than a bad joke. The check-in is hell on earth, you have to see to believe it. But if you can try not to see it yourself, just trust others."
1259,5046,Jirka...you should just try to imagine when it comes to leaving from there ;) It's pure fun!!
1260,5047,It is not an Airport - it is bad joke.
1261,5049,"Check out went good, although the people that arrived as last in the queline had to wait for over 1 hour. Bagage pickup with in blink of the eye"
1262,5050,"Very small and poor, no offence to no one but it's almost a third world airport."
1263,5052,"No duty free available, the bathrooms are always dirty and smell bad. The two stars are there only for the fact that in wintertime Bucharest Airport isn't that busy and all the procedures went well"
1264,5053,"Worst airport in Europe with the motto self-service and without electricity. The airport is overcrowded and not designed for the high number of passengers. During the security check you first have to get the boxes out of the air area by yourself, then go back and let yourself be checked. The employees don't care anyway because they only talk to each other or are on their smart phones. In principle, all employees are only on their smart phones or talking to each other instead of working. There is no drinking water at the airport, you can only buy overpriced water. In general, the airport impresses with poor service and high prices at LHR levels (it is still Romania). Everything is broken, seats, toilets, doors, automatic passport control, etc. The smoking area is always open (door broken), so the whole terminal smells of smoke. In addition, there are no power sockets throughout the airport, so anyone who needs electricity is lost."
1265,5055,"Very dirty, very crowded, not enough seats available, no drinkable water, extremely pricey, thankfully having a 22 min connection by train to the city."
1266,5058,"Old, dated airport, in dire need of expansion. The arrival building is the worst, you feel like you're back in the 80s."
1267,5059,"Horrible and hectic arrival experience! Even though the plane arrived on time, every passanger including me had to wait at the baggage claim for 1h for the baggages to arrive, and in the end, they've changed the original belt to another one! Filthy bathrooms with doors that don't lock! Only during low season this airport is 90% functional"
1268,5061,"Currently the airport is being expanded and represents a hellhole. Departures are made from containers (yes, containers) bunched together to form several rooms. The rooms are overcrowded, the toilets are rundown, prices in the two caffees - too high. The lounge is not functioning."
1269,5064,"Small airport, if there are three flights leaving almost at the same time, everything is horrible. The terminal is small and not enough seats. Shops are ""built in"" where ever they found a bit of space. Internal flights gates area is very small. To be honest the more i think about the more i noticed how many things are just bad. Toilets are decent i guess and the lounge is a joke. The amount of space allocate for the travelling passengers is just ridiculous. I would compare it to a steal abandoned train station. But, what ever it is, if you need to fly in the area, its the only ""decent"" option."
1270,5072,It was horrible because only over 2 cm I needed to throw away my l suitcase whit everything and only over 2 cm. Why? I mean over 2 cm come on be fr. There were people whit bigger case and they didn’t say nothing to them why? Because only because se argued whit my dad ne se started to greet us like shit.
1271,5075,"Tiny airport. Don't get there too early, maybe 1 hour before departure or 1.5 if checking luggage. Food is okay, coffee and bottled beverages available. There is an indoor smoking box past security."
1272,5079,"Wish I did not have to queue for check-in outside of the terminal, in the rain, for 30 minutes! Terminal T1 (handling international departures) is so small, it can't even fit the 125pax on our flight. The queue extended about 30m outisde the terminal. The waiting area is tiny, with passengers cramped into two small rooms."
1273,5085,THEY PLAYED THE SAME SONG FROM 07.30 in the morning until 10.00 our departure ON REPEAT! I still hate that song
1274,5095,"When you arrive it does not matter if it is winter or not you have to wait outside in order to get to the passport verification, The people that work there are not helping you they do not give you any information , the electronic panels that are supossed to guide you at which gate you have to stay are turned off. A single ""pub"" is available in the terminar but you can't buy food from there. No bus available after midnight nobody is giving a shit about you. Terrible managment !!!"
1275,5096,"Very nice airport, good prices, no waiting after check in, security check is fast and the plane is right outside of the gates (walking distance 30m to the planes, you don't have to wait for bus transfer). Better as Cluj, you can fly quicker !"
1276,5097,Cluj is way better and comfortable !
1277,5098,"No bus after 6p.m....help from infopoint: bus won't come today, the only way to get to the center is take a taxi (15Euro)"
1278,5102,"Timisoara is one of the vbery few airport in the world where doesn't exist the ""Kiss and Fly"" option. You have to pay 0.4 euro just because get in the airport part. Worst you lose at least 10 minutes to pay the ticket... self pay machine doesn't work!!"
1279,5105,When arriving here the airport looks messy and it's hard to even find a ATM. It was not clean and passport controll took very long.
1280,5112,"They dig deep into luggage. For the first time in a hundred flights I was forced to shove my backpack into the calibrator. When it remained sticking out a couple of centimeters, they wanted to send it for an additional payment, the price was almost the same as the ticket itself. But I tried and stuffed it in, taking out several clothes. Prices for catering are higher than in Domodedovo! Lots of annoying taxi drivers on arrival."
1281,5121,"The voice notifications are unreliable, the plane has not yet arrived from Moscow, but they are already announcing that they are boarding the return flight to this plane. It is impossible to order a taxi to the airport, no one wants to go there, only through the bomb. The clean area is very small, barely able to accommodate passengers on one flight. It is impossible to maintain any social distance there."
1282,5124,Small airport without any infastructure.
1283,5125,Extra-small airport without any infastructure.
1284,5135,It's one of the best airports in the whole Russia. I was there at summer with my family. It's greate that there is such a morden airport in Belgorod! I'd like to thank the staff of Passenger and Cargo Handling
1285,5137,"The airport is small, while servicing several flights there are not enough seats, you have to stand. The Windows are small and the view is blocked by some incomprehensible structures. Passengers want to see their plane."
1286,5138,"Upon arrival of the plane, all services inside were closed. The customs inspection area turned out to be hell, the plane was full, but only 3 inspection booths were working, as a result, we arrived at about 18-00 and got to the car only at 21-00. We waited a very long time for luggage."
1287,5143,ski priority luggage is issued last. The business lounge is a pitiful sight.
1288,5145,luggage was unloaded onto a nearby belt. Chelyabinsk airport is something with something. REGULARLY some kind of problem.
1289,5146,drivers of platform buses apparently previously carried firewood...
1290,5167,Soviet air terminal without enough facilities. Very small departure hall. You bags are lying on the floor (no carusel). Etc. Visiting soviet era. No wifi
1291,5169,Very poor and shabby small airport only for domestic flights.
1292,5180,"If you haven’t been out of business before, then a great quest awaits you."
1293,5196,Very old and poorly equipped airoport. However WI-FI here is pretty fast. There are two coffee shops on the first floor but kind of pricy. I recommend you to go straight ahead to the second floor. Meals and drinks there are twice cheaper.
1294,5197,free wi-fi in boarding zone boarding/de-boarding by bus or walking
1295,5198,old airport
1296,5199,Old airport without any kind of cafeteria or restaurants.
1297,5200,"Nice airport, free Wi-Fi, few people, clean"
1298,5206,"You arrive here as if you were in the good old Soviet Union: nothing has changed here for decades, it’s stability itself... Although I’m still glad that the network of departures from the airport is expanding."
1299,5207,"Really soviet airport, but it`s still nice... Not many of them are left. Good chance to see beautiful Russian forests on descent."
1300,5217,The worst airport of russia.
1301,5218,"Lots of people, not enough seats and no condition system"
1302,5219,poor quality
1303,5225,The domestic flights terminal looks very old and outdated. Seems to be that you're back to Russian 90-s. Clear zone is really too small and crowded. There is not enough space available to fit people waiting for their flights.
1304,5226,"The only advantage of this airport is that you can get your luggage pretty fast. Airport is located way far from the city, it might take your 40 mins to get to the hotel. Very old building with free cafes where you can find drinks and snacks for unreasonable high price."
1305,5228,"Krasnoyarsk Airport (Emelyanovo) is a horrific example of the Soviet Union and devastation! Apparently, there are no prospects for the construction of a new terminal, as in Yekaterinburg (Koltsovo), Samara (Kurumoch), Kazan..."
1306,5229,"Bad soviet times airport, lots of flights with bad organization. Ground staff is rude. Airport building is need to be renovated. No telescopic walkway passengers were dropped to the plane by bus, which was standing about 30 min besides the gate with opened doors at -25C The best thing is 30 min fron the city center."
1307,5230,"Tough inspection. I threw away the deodorant. Walking across the field to the plane, without a bus."
1308,5239,"Passengers arriving later than us were given luggage immediately, and we waited 40 minutes. The received luggage turned out to be damaged (the wheel was missing). At the exit, as usual, there were annoying smoky taxi drivers. I dream that Mineralnye Vody Airport will someday improve and become better..."
1309,5244,"The airport is crowded, the queues for registration are long, the information on the scoreboard is not relevant and incomprehensible. The cozy waiting room was removed, now there is only a small compressed waiting corridor. Due to the long loading of luggage, the flight was delayed for 50 minutes."
1310,5245,"Due to the queue at check-in, the flight is delayed, disgusting service"
1311,5252,"This was my first time in Russia and I didn’t have a good impression which didn’t help when my family were pulled aside in border control, we were forced to wait 1 hour for the security to check our passports. We weren’t even alone we had other passengers all who weren’t Russian. One man was a Spanish businessman that said that this was common for him to just be waiting for extra security checks"
1312,5254,"If it snows or rains, the airport collapses... Parking the plane for more than 40 minutes, baggage claim for almost three more hours..."
1313,5256,"Didn’t actually go into Russia, was only here for a layover, but I still had to go through a Russian security checkpoint where they scanned my belongings and checked my passport, which I thought was weird. They were quite friendly and helpful though. The terminal was small, filled with people and the toilets were disgusting. Everything seemed very used and unclean. To get access to the supposedly free wifi you had to call a number and ask for it, which I thought was really dodgy, so I avoided doing that. Thank god I only had to be there for 50 minutes, any longer and I couldn’t have taken it. My advise is to avoid this airport completely, it was really bad. 1/5"
1314,5258,"Decent airport, arrivals was pretty easy, but it was 0230. Departing is kind of a mess. The gate areas are far too small. The terminal feels incredibly crowded."
1315,5260,"Terminal B is full. Huge queues for both registration and inspection. While people are standing in queues, they start to be late for their flights, because of this, the departure of flights is also delayed. In general, the collapse. I tried the Kandinsky business hall - in general, a good hall, you can sit and relax, recharge your phones, eat or even work. But due to the fullness of the terminal, the business hall is also full, so of course the most comfortable seats are already occupied."
1316,5263,"Extremely inconvenient terminal B. Everything is done in one place. Getting there is a pain. Even when you arrive at the Terminal by Aeroexpress, it will take at least 50 minutes to go through pre-flight inspection. There are a lot of people, but the entire pre-flight inspection system is organized terribly"
1317,5264,"It is clear that there are increased security requirements, but why are more than half of the inspection lines not working?"
1318,5272,"Not informative signs at the airport terminal. Upon arrival, everyone was put on one bus, like herrings in a barrel, people were freezing. During the inspection, rude employees. The border zone is not organized. The toilets are dirty. The worst airport terminal in Moscow."
1319,5273,"Worst airport. There is no drinking water, you can buy a small bottle for an expensive. Out of few scanners, only one works, huge queues."
1320,5278,"They held us at customs for a very long time, and it took a long time to unload our luggage. We managed to leave the airport only an hour later."
1321,5281,Worst airport as I saw. Wry small facility at the terminal. Very bad toilets. Incompetent personnel. And soooooo far from Moscow.
1322,5282,"If several flights take off from ZIA in a row, then it becomes a branch of hell. Before boarding the plane (B2 974 ZIA-MSQ), we had to stand in five long lines: security at the entrance, registration, passport control, pre-flight inspection, and the boarding line. The terminal itself is essentially just a hangar with partitions, very cramped, no organization of space. There are no telescopic bridges structurally provided, the platform buses are some kind of worn-out Germans with the smell of gasoline in the cabin. The inspection at the entrance is the most frantic of all Russian ports where I have been, turn on your phone, open your wallet, etc. In general, the road to the airport is far from its main and most significant disadvantage."
1323,5299,"GOJ airport is the worst I've ever been to. Check in and gate on the 2nd floor (2 huge flights of stairs) and no elevator. A stroller, a child, a manual one - drag everything on yourself. And then also down onto the bus to the ramp!!! God forbid, if people help you get there"
1324,5300,"At this moment it's the worst airport I've visited. No food, no internet (temporary), no seats before the clean zone. The only good thing is that it takes a few minutes to reach the gate because the number of passengers is really small."
1325,5301,"There are few people, but only one counter is open at check-in; luggage is carried away from there manually; it moves very slowly. At the security check there are basins instead of baskets, it looks funny, it looks like a bathhouse. The gate on the board during registration and the real one easily do not match."
1326,5321,"Damned airport! Immigration officers hate passenger, asking thousands of stupid and humiliating questions! Fuck them! Hate them!"
1327,5326,"Hİ, Ekaterina Polyakova, I want to meet you. My facebook adress is geraslan@facebook.com pleace add me on facebook"
1328,5327,"If you arrive at night, make sure somebody can meet you with car. Taxi can take up to 3 (three) hours to arrive and international terminal closes two hours after plane arrives - the rest of the time you have to wait in the street."
1329,5337,"Absolutely inconvenient terminal. No Wi-Fi. It is impossible to have a snack, only tea, coffee and sweets. A bunch of people crowd into the tiny baggage claim area."
1330,5338,Totally sucks!!!
1331,5339,"Don’t worry, Sergey, everything is a little different. And in 2012, construction of a new terminal will begin. Here it is: http://dump.ru/file/5738061"
1332,5340,"Terrible airport. There are no luggage carts; when you arrive 50(!) meters from the plane, you are transported, if you’re lucky, by bus or in some kind of terrible cattle truck with a tractor. Upon arrival, passengers crowd at one (!) entrance half-door. Receiving luggage is absolutely terrible! scoop"
1333,5341,"An inconvenient airport, more than 300 people were flying to Moscow and with them sit more than 100 people flying to Khabarovsk"
1334,5343,"The airport is undergoing renovations, limited space for passengers, and few seats in the waiting room. Flight S7 was delayed for 3+ hours, and almost the entire time we had to stand in a supposedly clean area, which was actually dirty and dusty. The airline did not provide reasons for the delay, did not provide food or drinks, and a representative did not appear."
1335,5344,"Absolutely new terminal, enough pretty. Probably, therefore there are almost not yet some food and retail services, only one cafe. But the worst thing is very evil security. They seize any items violating Russian federal aviation rules. Public transport almost absent as well, only taxi."
1336,5345,I looked for Pskov. My review will be about Pskov. Why this site doesn't use some small airports. Pskov is a terrible airport. I can't write normal review. Stupid site(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
1337,5346,Former military airport. There's nothing in it.
1338,5356,"Just built, new airport with traditional Hard Soviet times service. New building with 2 entrieis but only one opens. Printing mobile boarding pass machine was out of order. Check-in counters - lots of counters, but only 1 wokrs for the entire flight. Amagine the line? Others counters were ocupined by some ground staff but they did nothing, just were seating in front of the monitor. Airport has many telescopic walkways but they used soviet, 25 yeras old bus to drop off the passeangers. It was winter -7C, we had to wait 20 min with open doors to have entire bus full of passangers. No heating system in the bus. Enjoy new airport, but Soviet service. Nothing changed."
1339,5357,"If you have chances not to travel to/via Samara, do the needful avoid it. New airport facility is extremely poorly designed, not convenient to passengers at all, staff is owful and not too helpful. Passengers lobby is about 15 degrees C (flew 02 Feb 2015) OK it was open just on mid Jan 2015, but my overall experience and expression - do not reccomend to family and friends. No services which I got used to - perhaps I am spoiled with examples of a good attitude."
1340,5359,"One of the worst airports in Russia, very silly ground staff, complicated airport building - navigation is impossible, too many stair and no signs. Could not get to the lounge due to wrong signs. Very rude and unprofeccional check-in staff."
1341,5365,"Sochi international terminal is very small. Only one cafe. No smoking area, people are smoking in the toilets."
1342,5374,"At Pulkovo Airport, parking rules are terribly inconvenient, which prevents passengers from calling a taxi normally. There is no such moronism either in Moscow or, especially, in the regions. The security check is also too thorough, there is no such thing at the border crossing, at Moscow airports, or in the Kremlin. There was a queue at the check-in, we had to wait 15 minutes because the staff at the check-in desks work very slowly. In short, the airport could be very convenient and cool, if not for the terrible management. I think nothing will change with the current leadership, it's better to change it."
1343,5375,"The luggage was already waiting for us on the tape. Most of all, I didn't like the fact that due to the rules of the airport it is impossible to call the taxi that you want, since very strict entry and exit rules apply for taxi drivers. As a result, we waited for a taxi for 15 minutes, and then we had to go up from the arrival zone to another floor, to the departure zone. This is done by the airport management to promote their taxis."
1344,5376,"The worst major airport in Russia. The waiting area is dirty and has old, crummy seats. There is not a single bench in the registration area; if it is difficult to stand, at least sit on the floor. Registration started 20 minutes later than scheduled. There are almost no outlets for charging gadgets anywhere. (McDonald's has 2 of them). At the security control there are typical St. Petersburg boors. They almost curse passengers when they try to put them in their place - they threaten to call the police for disturbing the order, I witnessed the scene. For some reason, the laptop was taken out of the bag and placed on top, the power cord was torn off."
1345,5377,"The movers work very poorly, either they break or tear the suitcases, every time my luggage doesn’t come out whole."
1346,5379,"Checks at the international part are a nightmare... it takes 10 minutes to look at your passport, where you’re going where for how long, etc. How much money and what are you bringing? They don’t pester you like that in Moscow. Everything is closed... the business hall is at the very end, they don’t let you through the elevator in Dutik, you have to walk half an hour to get there... but even though it was open, you could eat"
1347,5383,"I was amazed by the employees of the Stavropol airport.... Kind, helpful, smiling.... The airport terminal and the area in front of it are in excellent condition... thank you.."
1348,5384,We were unable to land due to fog.
1349,5386,"A regular soviet-time airport with dark walls and long corridors. The nice thing was that after landing the passangers were taken by bus to the airport, which was only some 30-40 metres (!) away from the plane =)))"
1350,5391,"It takes a very long time to unload luggage. Baby strollers are allowed onto the belt along with suitcases, as a result the suitcases fall onto the baby strollers. Baggage carts are located far from the baggage claim area."
1351,5394,Not modern airport.
1352,5408,Was in 2011. I didn't like the airport. Even here in Omsk it’s better
1353,5414,"We arrived at terminal 2. We entered the building through the jet bridge, and then we walked down the stairs with our suitcases. Take a bus to drive a nice circle around the parking lots instead of walking 50 meters."
1354,5420,"I arrived at the airport by aeroexpress. This is a convenient way to arrive at the airport, but all people who arrive by Aeroexpress get to check their luggage through narrow doors. There is only one scanner for checking luggage, because of this a large queue is going. The baggage scanner is very high. It is very difficult for girls to put their suitcases on it. This is a mockery of people. I arrived at the airport by Aeroexpress. This is a convenient way to arrive at the airport, but all people arriving by Aeroexpress are subject to baggage checks through narrow doors. There is only one scanner for checking luggage, which causes a long queue. The luggage scanner is very high. It is very difficult for girls to place their suitcases on it. This is a mockery of people."
1355,5423,"The queue at immigration upon arrival was horrifying. Don't expect a queue, and there will be tonnes of people trying to shove their way to get ahead of everyone else. Russian immigration is slow — the typical bureaucratic nonsense — and they take a heck of a long time to process every individual. I took two full hours to even get past immigration. After exiting the airport, do note that the airport train (to the city) only runs a few times a day. If you are delayed due to immigration, you might find yourself having to take marshrutka no. 107 to the Vladivostok Train Station. It ain't a nice experience!"
1356,5431,What. There is a taxi mafia operating at the airport. Be careful when arriving on late evening/night flights. Gett and Yandex Taxi will not leave due to the fact that they are interrupting orders.
1357,5435,My review for URS airport (can't find in database). So I had to choose nearest airport. Anyways Kursk airport is small
1358,5437,Garbage
1359,5451,"A bit expencive bar and dead Wi-Fi :( It works only in Grizzly Bar, wi-fi password ""31177443"" was work today. Self check-in also was dead, because airport is changing Amadeus to Sirena system... Security at the entrance works bad, they are control passengers badly. Parking is free just for 15 minutes. Also, you can't determine which terminal is for domestic and which is for international flights from outside, it's just market ""A"" and ""B"". Note: Terminal A is for domestic flights and Terminal B is for International airlines Sorry for bad language :3"
1360,5452,Awful. 1 hour delay + 1 our at the plane waiting untill loading of cargo wil be acomplished.
1361,5464,"Quite basic but does the job. Main downside is the travel to and from airport, can range from 3 hours (if staying in the north)"
1362,5465,"Awful airport for arrivals Waited an hour for bag to come to find out that they didn’t offload a crate of the plane, the plane was ready to go to tabago when they had to shut its engines off to get the crate. No queuing system. Worst airport ever"
1363,5481,Dammam airport is far away from Khobar. No public transportation. not a friendly airport. very boring. sitting area not comfortable.
1364,5482,Sloooooooooooow immigration!!!!
1365,5485,"North Terminal (old JED) is pretty basic. Little to no dining options, few gates, uncomfortable chairs. Lounge is $60pp which doesn't feel worth it. No WiFi. Best bet is to sleep in the prayer room!"
1366,5487,Terrible and rude staff at Jeddah airport. They should hire educated people who know not to say the F word to passengers.
1367,5491,"This is a brand new airport but it doesn’t offer any wifi to its passengers. The signage are so misleading and confusing. There are just 3 lounges in operation at the moment; The Saudia Alfursan (Business & First Class Passengers Only) , Plaza Premium (Available through Dragon Pass App) & The Welcome Lounge (Available on Lounge Key). The best tip to find free wifi & charging facility is located at WHsmith store located near to the gate A01-12."
1368,5492,"Very crowded international transit area. Disorganized, slow security check. Took almost an hour to pass it. Runway is very far away from the terminal, 30 minutes taxiing... Short connection is really not an option there. Wifi doesn't work. All in all bad experience."
1369,5498,"Very poor airport, limited shopping and dining options and very unhygienic toilets. Wifi had decent speed but unstable"
1370,5499,"Extremely crowded and chaotic with limited dining and shopping options. Also, toilets aren't well maintained and tend to be dirty. Wifi is decent but fails often"
1371,5500,"It was the worst experience with the staff at KKIA. Travelling to Jeddah on SV1047, I was running late because of a wrong turn for terminal 5. I had baggage to checkin so it was crucial to make it to checkin at least 60 mins before departure. I had a sky priority tag on my boarding card which meant I can use the business class lanes. I couldn’t spot that at first so tried to speak to one of the supervisors at the checkin counters if I could skip the normal queue. As soon as I started to speak she stopped me and said rudely ‘can u give me a min?’ I stopped but was impatient due to the limited mins left. She hardly cared and got busy on a phone call! During this time I saw the priority sign on the opposite checkin bay. They was one passenger in front and I waited for him to finish. As soon as my turn came I tried to show my boarding card on the phone and the guy at the counter got busy on his mobile! After a long few seconds, he took the phone and I put the luggage on the belt. He asked me rudely to remove the previous tags I had on. He was like ‘remove that tag’. I mean, what happened to ‘please’ and a little courtesy? After this, I got thru the auto gate and to security check. Being as good as business I turned towards the fast track lane which is normally red carpeted. The lady there started waving as if shooing me away! So much prejudice! Can’t a normal looking person fly business? Does he have to suit up? It was only after she saw the red marked ‘sky priority’ on my card did she let me pass through. It’s ok if she stops me, but there’s definitely a better and much more courteous way! Ask me questions for God's sake, I’ll show you why I came this way… I’m telling you, the lady at the brand after security store was much more helpful and polite. This is the worst prejudice experience I’ve faced in this country! I hope they shape up…soon. Please understand we also are humans and can travel business or have a priority pass. We work here for a living and are also entitled to some respect!"
1372,5504,7 hour delay due to weather. 3 hours on the plane then back to the terminal. Very poor and conflicting information from the ground staff when we could find them.
1373,5514,An old airport and a small airport. It was very hot.. Still waiting for the new one.. ------------------------ An old and small airport. It was very hot.. Waiting for the new airport..
1374,5515,This airport is challenging! Departure area looks ok but at peak hours excessively overcrowded. Frequent equipment breakdowns (ie.conveyor belts) Long queues at passport control/security. Poor and very limited services. Fair lounge servic
1375,5516,Yeah.. all that chaos is sort of charming
1376,5517,"Avoid... never seen such a poorly organized airport, the baggage belt that you load until it breaks down, just mind-blowing!"
1377,5519,"It is an absolute mess of an airport; reconstruction works are never ending; managing capacities are absolutely not sufficient for passenger numbers. Ground handling stuff always rude and nervous. Hygiene in lavatories leaves A LOT to desire. Just a couple of cafes and similar shops. Getting to the airport again inappropriate to meet passenger needs - no independent routes like tube or rail, while Belgrade street traffic is horribly unpredictable. Early morning and late evening flights are left without any public traffic coverage, and it is at best mediocre even in the middle of the day, and again, totally unpredictable. The good sides: fast security control, no need to take out liquids or electronic devices etc. Check-in for major airlines has a lot of capacity, too."
1378,5523,"Me and one other girl, both passengers from the same flight from Tivat with PRIORITY baggage were left without out suitcases after all passengers have claimed their luggage (which we waited for 45 minutes). We went to the baggage carousel start, moved the rubber curtains and communicated with the workers who were extremely slow and uninterested, asked if there were more bags from Tivat. We were just told off, ""wait, I don't know..."". Then, the third time we picked, I saw my suitcase sitting with bunch of others on the cart, together with priority stickers and girl's suitcase was under it. We yelled and showed them the suitcases and they finally put them onto the baggage belt for us to take it. So we got the luggage thanks to ourselves after more than one hour (longer then the 40 min flight), and it wasn't even a rush hour, 4 planes or so. Just when I thought the airport is becoming developed and nice, management managed to get people who can't even read, I think. Disgrace!"
1379,5528,"It wasn't possible to go to the toilet after security control, because of the other flight at a similar time, ""not to mix the passengers"". Very poor organization."
1380,5529,"This was the longest security control, there was only one slow person controlling passports and tickets and i passed the control 10 minutes after the planned closing of the gate (20 peoples were still behind me, and there was only one flight - the ours - from the airport at this time). WiFi goes with difficulties, and there is no place to buy something for eat before the control."
1381,5530,"Be aware that it's a small airport and has only one hall, which is very uncomfortable to stay in for more that 20 minutes (even 10..). They have no mail box there so make sure to send everything from the city."
1382,5534,"Totally shitty lounge, broken toilets, nothing to eat.... Horrible... Not possible... Never again!"
1383,5537,"Don't like this airport. Building is very old, nothing to do while waiting. Airport staff is extremely slow."
1384,5539,For departures airport is better and AC.
1385,5556,Nice outside but a very slow system the have there. everything seemed to be in slow motion. with no good food services and once we went through the passport check there were 2 cafes/shops and NONE of them sold normal water.
1386,5562,"Terrible experience. Always no soap on toilet. Stuff is rude, acting terrible, very bad. Always long waiting time"
1387,5565,The security won't let you take some equipment that is allowed by airline like tent or wooden souvenirs (they say it's dangerous - you can hit someone with wooden cat figure and they'll force you to pay for additional checked luggage on the airport). The stuff if very ignoring and rude at the same time. Not recommended - better fly from nearby Vienna airport
1388,5568,"Small airport. Very poorly organized. In summer, you can see students cycling to plane. It's one joke how weak this airport is. They even set up departure problems for a small number of gates. I flew once and there were 2 departures for 1 gate. Total chaos."
1389,5575,"how can people call this ""airport"" ? :D"
1390,5580,small but nice
1391,5582,Small but veary nice.
1392,5583,This is Super airport.
1393,5589,"Highly disorganised for this flight. No PA about the gate change, the screens weren't working. Even the check-in was confusing."
1394,5600,"Tax refund works horribly. Slow as hell and the receipt is not enough. You need to actually show the thing. So if you already checked it in the baggage, you are screwed. Everywhere else the receipt is enough, but here they make these strange rules."
1395,5602,Only 2 Immigration officers on duty trying to process 5 wide body departures. Queued for an hour until BA ground staff picked passengers out of the line as the flight was closing. This was repeated for LH and QR passengers. Throughout people were queue jumping without a clear reason. No marshalling staff nor airport managers seen.
1396,5607,"I don't know if it was because it was Friday night, but the queue to clear passport control took 1 hour."
1397,5614,"No airline lounge after the International immigration, if you want lounge access then you have to go through domestic security, enter the lounge and if you are flying out on international you have to repeat all the security again!!!!"
1398,5615,"What a dump. Virtually nothing is working - TV's broken, chairs broken. Most of the staff are on their phones (free airport WiFi) watching videos. Excessive loud personnel conversations between huddled groups of staff. The airport is dirty and absolutely no sign of any management. The grass outside hasn't been cut in months, the place is totally run down. The Mugg & Bean in the departure lounge is an absolute joke. Half of the menu is unavailable. Airport's Company must take full responsibility."
1399,5616,The place is a toilet. Everything is run down and dirty. No maintenance has been done on this building for years. Airport Company is a disgrace to what was a pleasant small airport.
1400,5617,Absolute hell hole. Run down and very badly managed. The staff were average. New management needed badly and it needs a huge refurb.
1401,5626,Never disembarked.
1402,5631,Old airport. We suffered a power blackout. Old signaling with not all the flights on displa in all monitors.
1403,5639,During COVID you expect a few problems. however queue jumping does irritate me especially people whom arrive late to the airport and make it everyone elses problem
1404,5667,"Can't record,bad for planespotters and not enough restaurants,also small boarding gates and small planes only.its very militarily made,so it's very strict abt everything but it's just all OK without them"
1405,5692,"Departing T3 - there is only one resturant, and 1 food stand, but 4 duty free shops. No other shops."
1406,5694,"No matter when you go, it is a clean facility that is comparable to Incheon Airport. It is the gateway to domestic flights in Korea."
1407,5700,"Too crowded in the morning time and lack of resting area and retail shops, and airline lounges are located in landslide, which is not convenient."
1408,5702,"Absolute worst Immigration experience. Additionally, Customs are very rude and didn't speak to me when I was pulled aside."
1409,5704,"Absolute slowness, why do we need to go through Security even though we went through Security at the starting point already? Not much to eat. Customs were slow."
1410,5708,Every food outlet and lounges shut down around 8-9 PM even though the airport serves flights well into midnight.
1411,5717,"DECADENT and very rude and unpleasant staff. I don't recommend it, it's the second time and nothing has changed."
1412,5718,"--GENERAL-- Quite disappointed, I expected better from this airport. It operates 1/1 terminals and stays long. With fewer and fewer flights. --GOOD-- Retailers. --BAD-- Most of the staff, (security, passport control) very rude and unpleasant, WITH EVERYONE. Poor facilities. Little space. Security control (mounted with school tables). This airport made me sad, at passport controls the people were so inefficient that on an AVERAGE flight of about 180 people there was a terrible queue, I don't even want to imagine what it would be like with 2 or 3 flights..."
1413,5720,"I advise everyone who reads me to fly to Santiago because the airport in La Coruña is not reliable. I flew to La Coruña because the flight to Santiago was full and I had a horrible trip and I missed my connection and the worst thing is that in the end they diverted us to Santiago and I missed my connection. If I know, I would have flown to Santiago a day earlier and it is also a airport 24 hours a day and from what I have seen the operation is very reliable."
1414,5730,"35 minutes queue to get through passport control. Thanks a bunch to all those who voted for Brexit. Also thanks to Alicante airport staff for having the worst scanners possible, all funnelling to one bored individual who stamps passports."
1415,5735,No lounge. No separate check in area for business. Check in staff badly informed about each country health requirements.
1416,5739,"Yes, it's not big but the view is wonderful. The building is new."
1417,5741,Worst Airport I have ever travelled to. Too small. Like a shack.
1418,5754,"Not bad but not great either overall. For comparisons you have to go against the non main gateways, in this instance BCN is better than MAN (though any airport is) but nothing on say KIX."
1419,5755,Took over one hour to get through immigration - a great example of staff living up to the airport name.
1420,5764,Dungeon looking car rental and arrivals. 33 Celsius today and it was boiling inside . Built in 2000s but look much older
1421,5767,"They Don't have any fast check in machine! And at 6 am Was open only one security check with 4 plane leaving at almost same time. No instructions no Support from personel .......... Really Not a proper Services for business flight, that are the mani kind of passe grès from Bilbao."
1422,5775,Layout of the airport is satisfactory however the air conditioning was not turned on in the terminal making the airport very uncomfortable. There’s a serious lack of staff at food outlets resulting in a 45 min to 1 hour waiting time to be served.
1423,5783,"As usual with Ryanair hubs, no priority pass lounge, staff are unfreindly, seats are uncomfortable, secruity was empty, but the views over the apron are brilliant"
1424,5788,very far from barcelone
1425,5789,Very Cheap looking airport
1426,5791,olaa chikas trip
1427,5792,They do not believe in air conditioning. We waited an hour for the check in desks to open. Had 10 minutes to use the toilets etc before we had to board. Fridges for drinks in the shops were all off.
1428,5798,Very old fashioned check in experience (baggage drop). 1hr wait to process luggage then we needed to run to the gate!
1429,5809,This Airport only saving grace is it local to Leeds otherwise its better to go to Manchester as failing have been listed many times by thousands of others Not enough Seating No Shops Drop off Fee rip-off Taxi firm paying the Airport to have a private franchise stopping all other taxis
1430,5815,POOR Impresion. Really small. Withought vip longe. Bad offer of drinks an meals. Withought any place to put your pc and conect to the electricity. To not coming any more.
1431,5816,Bad transportation here.
1432,5828,"Pay attention to the weight of your suitcases, their weighing belts are not correctly calibrated, +/- 2 kg of difference with reality !!!"
1433,5836,"Extremely oddly placed signs, at least for what I saw at T1. I've been to a bunch of airports but never felt lost like here. Getting off the plane I had no clue where to go, signs had me walking around like an idiot. When I found the way out, I only knew for certain where to go if I was looking for a lounge and maybe where to go for an exit. Then, no clue where're the bus stops.. And same thing when getting to the airport to fly away, you see check in desks but no visible signs for the security/gates anywhere. I'd plan for way more than my usual hour if I was connecting here. From bigger airports I've traveled to or through, all AMS, LHR, FRA, DOH, FCO, ZRH, JFK, LAX, LAS, CPH, OSL did a better way leading me around than Barajas. Only CDG.. All bud CDG lol But, getting to the airport is reasonably fast and very easy (with the exception of the above..), both by bus and rail. Security at T1 took about 10 minutes which I thought was impressive for the size of Barajas. Lovely staff too."
1434,5838,"Bad experience, poorly attended and rude people, we stopped at the remote one and they wanted to fit as many people as possible per cm2 on the bus, extremely full"
1435,5842,"Very rude and unprofessional personnel at the security check. Can't speak a single word of English so they just shout at you in Spanish. You have to collect the containers to put your personal stuff in yourself behind their own desks because they don't seem to bother with restocking them at the front of the line. Ridiculous and an utterly shameful example of the Spanish 'I couldn't care less' mentality. Wi-Fi works only 50% of the time. Toilets are broken (faucets and flushes don't work, toilets smell imensely). While there are a lot of establishments to buy food, all of them sell the same (barely any variety) and are all very expensive."
1436,5847,The food in general is a big shit. It's really imposibol taste the very liked spanish cuisine at any airport in Balearic Islands. In the same way even the quality of the food is not much more better in the VIP lounge.
1437,5848,"Airports are the gateway to our country for many tourists. We are a country with a reputation for being a place where you eat well and cheap. It seems incredible to me that in our airports in general, with honorable exceptions such as Santiago de Compostela, the gastronomic offer of hot meals is reduced to a McDonald's or a Burger King. And this one from Mahon is no exception."
1438,5849,"The offer of food is very bad. Is very difficoult found fresh food, like vegetables or frut, dinners cooking at the moment, etc."
1439,5850,"Restaurants at the airports frequently are not cheap, but here I find it even more expensive than normaly. The offer of food is bad."
1440,5852,"The man working in the SantaMaria Cafe (just after Duty Free Shop) in departure lounge was extremely rude when I simply asked him to open a bottle with a bottle opener. Security very abrupt and unhelpful. Shame, because we have had nothing but warmth and friendliness from the locals on the island."
1441,5887,Chaos because of bad weather on Sunday and ATC issues in The UK delays and cancelled flights terminal was rammed
1442,5892,"very small regional airport. The security system is crap, so bad that on our return we almost missed our flight (alongside 6p other passengers)."
1443,5894,"reus airport has to be one of the smallest airports i have ever been too. most of the vending machines when i visited didnt seem to work, also the whole security process seems very rushed and the security team do not seem like they know what they are doing!"
1444,5900,"Simple airport, you can get there by public buses, but the schedules are not very good, (they can improve) since this airport is set up for group trips that are picked up and taken to their place of leisure and people who go to work...I guess that's why they don't have public buses anymore. You need taxis if you are traveling on your own and are on the outskirts of the city, the minimum taxi is 11 euros. If you go with more than two hours, take something good to distract you... small airport."
1445,5911,Very simple airport. Very boring. I didn´t like it at all.
1446,5912,Fantastic!!
1447,5913,Cancelled due to Fog
1448,5925,Got there with an Uber. No worries. Sat down in the small food court and from a table next to us a suitcase got stolen (and no-one saw it happen). The police told them that it happened a lot.
1449,5934,"The airport presents a very sad and industrial 1960's architecture which, unfortunately, doesn't reflect the beauty of Andalusian buildings. However, the process to boarding gates was rather fluid but it might not be true during rush hours...There are several duty free shops and food stores to provide travellers but the most important facility was absent! Indeed, for more than a half hour the only toilet available for men was under a zealous cleaning. Fortunately, the functional boarding gates catch up this black spot."
1450,5938,"Very bad experience. Check-in desks were slow, security check very old, not much staff at security point. The boarding was fast. Only one café at the airport, it does not seem to be a international airport."
1451,5939,"Very bad experience. Check-in desks were slow, security check very old, not much staff at security point. The boarding was fast. Only one café at the airport, it does not seem to be a international airport."
1452,5940,tenerife-north
1453,5941,"Terrible airport, rude staff at security control and at the gate, the airport seems not well maintained, chaotic boarding, I can't really recommend it"
1454,5945,"Awful - we were there in February but we cannot imagine how they can handle the sunmmer season. Check-in + security check were OK, but not the situation at the gates: No windows respectively the few that can be reached are covered with cloth, too dark and gloomy inside, depressing grey architecture, no decoration - everywhere a very unpleasant draught due to the air conditioning, too cool for winter. Top of all: the toilet facilities for women! The queues at all three bathrooms reached through the terminal, much too long waiting times! I call this discrimination of femals (not only to be found at that airport of course), not all WCs could be used (closed), defective closing mechanisms at the doors. How bad must the situation be in summer... For women."
1455,5947,"Airport has been extended. Considerable works going on. Heading towards Zone C departures airside, nothing to do. You need to turn left from Duty Free and walk to the shops and cafe's. Not enough seating airside at busy times."
1456,5949,"Corona does not exist on this airport. No distance during boarding, no soap on the toilets, airport buses extrem overfilled."
1457,5954,"Small, lot of construction works inside, impossible to understand what’s being said on speakers, no priority lanes respected. Lounge was a joke, just old sandwiches were served (prepared 6 days earlier, the label said) and no warm dishes."
1458,5958,"This summer I don't know what happened to the air conditioning, but it doesn't work. We boarded at gate 11, and everyone with fans and magazines tried to reduce the heat. Adults and children alike. What level of airport do we have in Valencia, I'm ashamed"
1459,5968,"Only cash machine has been out of order for weeks. No forex facilities, and the bus only accepts cash. So if you do not have cash, you are stuck."
1460,5969,"Only cash machine has been out of order for weeks. No forex facilities, and the bus only accepts cash. So if you do not have cash, you are stuck."
1461,5970,"The bus to the airport takes almost an hour, because it stops at every shopping center in its way. Online check-in is not possible for this airport, so you have to do it at the counter. The only things that were open there were the bathrooms and some vending machines and after security you only have a vending machine with drinks."
1462,5981,"Not a modern airport at all - This has nothing to do with heightened security posture. No F&B outlets post security checks in case you are boarding from gates R1, R2 or R3 - something to keep in mind if you are travelling with young kids. Lounge access not offered even at a price. No aero-bridge access to aircraft - something to wonder about given that this is the only airport for the entire country. Wifi is choppy at least in at R3 gate. The gate did have charging points, a water dispenser and seats reserved for clergy."
1463,5986,"Khartoum airport's modest facilities keeps it away from the rest of the world's growing airports in the region, as it lacks so many necessities. No Wi-Fi, food service is not up to standards, sometimes food isn't offered in the airport restaurant, just some snacks and drinks. More or less few upgrades took place but still the airport needs huge improvement."
1464,5988,WORST airport. just two gates and rude services. truly ashamed
1465,5989,The less said the better. Worse than a bus station.
1466,5990,"Disgusting airport! There are few waiting places in the storage area, the duty free is poor. Wi-Fi is just for show, but it’s impossible to connect."
1467,5991,Charter plain
1468,5994,Terrible airport. Took 2hrs to get our bags as they put a handful on at a time. Very limited facilities inside the terminal. Would also avoid the food here ????
1469,5995,"Suriname's international airport needs to improve on everything! The structure of the airport is bad, even after some renovations, there is a lot to improve. Bathrooms were practically unusable. a bad factor is also the distance and types of transport to get to Paramaribo. I hope Suriname has an airport at its level."
1470,5996,"Suriname's international airport is far from what it should be. Zaderij airport is difficult to access, there are few transport options to the airport and very expensive, with almost no options for food and shops."
1471,5997,"The boarding experience was very bad, not to mention horrible with the huge check-in line and the departure lounge with no varied food options. But the wifi internet was good."
1472,5998,"Zanderij Airport, which serves as Paramaribo's international airport, is relatively small. The services found at an international airport, which is the only one in the country, are extremely weak, however, as it does not receive a large number of flights and makes immigration passage faster. There are only two baggage carousels at arrivals, and a small duty-free shop. The service structure is terrible at the time I arrived, with no store open."
1473,5999,"Small airport compared to international airports, very poor passenger service structure and not very comfortable."
1474,6000,"small airport, upon arrival there are only two baggage carousels, but at the time my flight arrived there was only one, so it was relatively quick to go through immigration and collect the luggage, but there are no service options for customers, no shops, restaurants, just a small duty-free shop."
1475,6005,"Let me put it this way. I hope that a new, larger terminal is included in Säve's future plans. Even though I knew this is a low-cost airport, the terminal was the worst I've been to. The shop and the bar were OK, but otherwise it felt like you were inside a cramped industrial premises. Now it was certainly my employer who was responsible for this trip. But I'd rather pay more and travel from real airports with real companies."
1476,6007,terrible airport
1477,6009,"It's like a shed... I was there when I was picking up my brother and we ate at the restaurant before check in, it was horrible and rude staff in the restaurant"
1478,6010,Poor. Basically a shed. Tiny baggage reclaim. No cafes or shops on exit.
1479,6011,wish there was Greek Airlines too! ;)
1480,6012,"Disgusting control. So many employees and only 1 inspection open to the entire public. Of which 2 were open but one exclusively for fast track with no one there. Unhygienic conditions, employes are only there to make it difficult to pass. The boxes are very small you can't even fit a bag in there. Otherwise a nice clean airport but with nasty white lights. No public transport from and to airport. Only flixbus and overpriced Flygbussaena"
1481,6018,"Getting to airport is not difficult: many bus transport companies like Swebus or Flygbussarna will get you right on time. Of course there is Uber and many taxis. Security check is also fast and without any concert. WiFi is free, however limited to 100 mb or 3 hours of use. Terminal inside is with a good layout and walking distances are short. Check-in at the airport was awful for me as there was no check-in agent on time for my evening flight (had to wait for 20 min). As a result, I didn't make it to lounge (they close quite early). Food and water are overprices comparing to general Swedish airports. In total, I still believe that airport would improve its services."
1482,6031,Only one small gift shop and one cafe. Wifi is free however after 20 minutes it said my wifi had been depleted/expired. However it lasted for a couple of hours for my friend.
1483,6040,Actually Malmslätt.
1484,6048,"Travel to city unbelievably bad for such a small airport/city, waited almost 2 hours for airport bus, and the trip took almost 1 hour. At the airport, the lounges are closed on weekends."
1485,6062,"Most boring airport in Europe? LOng waiting time for checked in luggage to appear, lousy facilities. Best thing about it is the transport to and from: use Arlanda Express, fastest and most reliable."
1486,6066,Terrible distance to walk from Terminal 4 to bagage claim area and than have to walk back to terminal 4 for bus pic up. Terminal 5 still under construction work since 3 years :-(
1487,6068,"Horrible airport, very little space, narrow corridors, tables and chairs from the cafes and other shops block the way, at the gate there is absolutely no space for waiting passengers, not only seats but also standing space is so limitted that you will have to stand in the way of people going to other gates. Bad information, for some reason in all terminals the screens show only flights from terminal 5 - why? No clue. Signage is so bad, that you dont even know whcih terminal you actually are in."
1488,6080,Not spotter friendly.
1489,6091,"The worst airport where I have ever been. No facility in passengers zone, there is no even an outlet for charging. Security check strictly before two hours before flight. No wi-fi, no lounge. Stone age!"
1490,6094,Crazy return/night without sleeping
1491,6101,"When I arrived in to UME my baggage was lost. The kind lady in the kiosk told me that it was stuck in ARN, so this incident wasn’t their fault"
1492,6110,Bad airport for overnight connect flights. It closes at midnight and there's no comfortable places to rest. The airport main lounges looks like a street with lots of homeless people sleeping (the passengers with connect flights at morning must sleep on the floor!).
1493,6112,"International transit is a mess. Bad sinage, and for us a one hour wait. No one knew how to make the scanner work"
1494,6114,"Some big mistake concerning the security check. I was travelling with someone who was not frequent flyer. at the security check, was denied to the priority lane. How come that people with no experience could not go with the frequent flyer at the priority lane as they have no experience and do not talk the local language nor English ?"
1495,6115,"No indications where to go to P26 by feet and after leaving P26, no indications to find the highway, i went to the wrong direction... Immigration was very long because people are st*pid and are not able to use automated border control gates."
1496,6116,"The French airport sector is very different from the rest of the airport sector. The departure lounge is old, dirty, with rubbish bins that have not been emptied and no modern conveniences. Only two shops with very little choice. I don't understand why the standard is so low compared to the rest of the terminal."
1497,6117,"At the last minute the gate changed to the French sector. I had to go to a new part of the airport, despite going through security I had to join a long queue to go through security again when I had a few minutes to bording. This was very stressful for me. The airport in general is very confusing."
1498,6127,"Really bad navigation throughout the airport, non-sensual directions and facility names... We have been moving up and down to find out what is where, despite of following the sign... On the other hand, there is a perfect train connection, after the security there is a lot of space to sit, lay down, entertain."
1499,6129,Connecting flight was cancelled. Airport staff was not able to arrange hotel accommodation and related services they are obliged to provide by law in such case. Instead we have ben told that they do not have staff and resources and we have to arrange it by ourselves. On top of it airport personnel was arrogant.
1500,6130,Still waiting for baggage to come from Zurich where was forgotten to be loaded on transit flight. 4 days they cannot send one baggage?!!
1501,6131,"Having missed a connection late in the evening, we are redirected to a ticket point outside the security area, which is not staffed at 22:00 any more. No chance to get a hotel voucher or an appropriate rebooking. The airport effectively shuts down in the evening, and stranded passangers are not cared for."
1502,6143,good and friendly
1503,6148,"Matsu Beigan Airport (馬祖北竿機場) (IATA: MFK, ICAO: RCMT) is one of the airports in Matsu Islands, Lienchiang, Fukien Province, Republic of China (Taiwan). Both the IATA code and national flag are wrong. Plz correct!"
1504,6150,bad weather
1505,6155,"Super tiny airport, without any restaurants or foodstores within walking distance. Only food could be found there were microwave instant food! Everyone there were super nice, except for the staff in tourist info counter, whom r quite incapable."
1506,6156,A very small airport with only four immigration counter
1507,6170,Late-night flights mean Emirates/China Airlines lounge are closed with no service available. Only vending machines available for food
1508,6183,Bush airport without service of any kind other than local catering. Recording is manual and random. The atmosphere is very friendly and security is probably absent. But it is progress compared to Kinshasa or Goma visited a few decades ago.
1509,6187,"Arrived via the Internal flights terminal - poor connections to the International terminal. A few small facilities whilst waiting for Check-in to open, and virtually nothing on the Departure side. Most of the VERY few shops and eating facilities either closed for renovation or 'out of hours', and poor seating arrangements. A very poor show for the capital's airport."
1510,6188,Arrived at the internal flights' terminal; minimal facilities and only some taxis available to link to the International terminal.
1511,6189,They never keep the information screens updated. Many flights are delayed and you cannot know unless you ask the staff.
1512,6192,"If i can remember, there is bad or no wifi, but if you are staying at the lounge downstairs, the wifi is good and good food."
1513,6193,"Worst airport I have ever been to. I was waiting ages for immigration, passport control, baggage claim, basically for everything. The place is messy and not organized at all. For domestic flight I had to wait at international departure gate. Prices are generally high. Not enough space to sit around the terminal, especially at gates. Only one check-in was open, so the que was unbereable. While waiting for delayed flight, nobody was able to asnwer anything, or to help. Hopefully with new terminal things would get better."
1514,6194,Kilimanjaro airport is good for quick departures which is what it's supposed to be for. It is not built to handle such long delays. There is only one small cafe meaning the airline staff had to take passengers outside of the terminal to a nearby restaraunt. The upstairs lounge was filled with bugs and had no ac. The wifi was working at first but turned off and was extremely unreliable.
1515,6199,Small but efficient airport. A pleasant way to arrive in this part of Africa
1516,6200,4
1517,6204,"The staff there moves as slowly as ""Flash"" in Zoomania. Therefor the whole airport is full of passengers waiting to get their bags dropped, pass the security check, or go through immigration. Worst experience in my whole life."
1518,6205,"As I were there, the terminal was a small dirty something. There was no WiFi, any shop or restaurant or lounge. The Immigration was very slow. The only thing what was got, was the Baggage reclaim, it was quite fast, and there was no bus, we just walked to the terminal from the plane."
1519,6206,"Small back-of-beyond airport, mostly catering for internal flights and the occasional scheduled international flight."
1520,6207,On the time (2002) the airport did not have sufficient services and equipment to provide a quick check-in and check-out.
1521,6208,"A very basic airport, but there's nothing I felt I needed that the airport didn't have. Be prepared for length check-in queues, and the same goes for customs/immigration (both on entry and exit)."
1522,6210,"This is an airport used by a lot of charter companies, therefore there are days when 2 or more flights from Europe arrives at the same time. This can create a lot of lines and confusion. When you arrive from abroad you have to fill 2 forms, pay a Tax ($50) and proceed to immigration. Baggage delivery it's hand made one piece @ time in a small area... When you leave the country you'll have to pay again (charter flights only). The only lounge @ ZNZ is small and basic but with nice personnel. Ethiopian airline business class has priority boarding."
1523,6211,"Most funny and interesting airport I ever met. They own 1 computer for all the checkin queues. You stand outside waiting about 2 hours and don't forget to pick your luggage after the check-in and bring it to th e security yourself. Afterwards don't forget to pay your tax, if not, nobody will tell you until you are going to board. Boarding is a nice walk on the tarmac. Just relax..."
1524,6212,check-in was a story by itself... do they know what their job is about?
1525,6235,Very small airport looks like a subway station but everything was fast. For me this is best way for me from Buriram to Bangkok. Otherwise you will spend 5 hours on the highway.
1526,6236,"Used the Automated Check in machine to get boarding passes, was unable to get a self serve bag tag meaning that I had to physically line up with my partner for over an hour. Staff need to trust passengers to self check in and check own bag other wise great experience"
1527,6241,Immigration queue probably around 2 hours. Some people get lucky when they rearrange the queues. The personnel cannot handle mainland Chinese tourists when they cut across everyone.
1528,6258,Decent enough airport. Luggage arrived promptly and intact.
1529,6268,"wonderful little airport. When flying with Bangkok Airways, one feels as if in business class."
1530,6271,"Rude staff, dont have departure cards, no food/drinks at night, no information about delays, long waiting times, cold like hell"
1531,6274,"Worst airport yet, had to stand in Air Asia check in line more than 1,5H. No information TV-s in departure hall. Boarding messy and confusing."
1532,6275,Also Krabi is a fairly modern airport it is quite dirty. Most of the chair in the international departures area have torn seat covers and some of the seat backs are broken
1533,6276,"Krabi is one of the worst airports (or maybe the worst) I've ever been to - there isn't a single thing that would be good - immigration queues are hectic, security queues until checkin are hectic, food choice is limited and prices are crazy. Everything is old and stinks, boarding procedure is some kind of joke and WiFi - you can forget about it. This is one of the main airports in a country which gets 20% of GDP from tourism..."
1534,6277,One of the worst airports I have flown out of. Very long ques and not many staff on passport control meaning a very long wait in a room with no air conditioning. Very few places to eat.
1535,6278,HUGE lines in front of customs. Only one of eight counters open. Waited nearly 1hour to pass even there was just one A320 arriving at the time. VERY Poor Information on the Gates! Even no Monitor to check the flight status!
1536,6282,"Too early at the airport, security check with long waiting time and very strict checks (shoes off), less shops for food and drinks in saftey area, few seats for waiting"
1537,6283,"Crowded crappy airport. 50 mins for bagage drop off. Crowded chaotic passport control, 4 lanes come to one point are pushed through one small entrance. People pushing and shoving to get to the passport control, lots of angry faces. The promised 10 minutes took us 40 minutes."
1538,6299,"a small, old military airport. Nothing great, but I can handle it. Even clean and well-kept bathrooms. There are 2 Thai restaurants on the 1st floor - even tasty :)"
1539,6300,"One hour wait at immigration, only one booth open."
1540,6307,"It's a hut on a field actually, but has its atmosphere (wooden signboards, grass roof, no walls, etc)."
1541,6309,"Mostly domestic. Would not recommend to arrive way ahead of time as there is nothing much to do. A few coffee shops and some small souvenir shops prior to pass security. After security, almost nothing to do but a coffeeshop. No free wifi available."
1542,6313,International airport ?????

1544,6322,
1545,6323,"awful airport to fly out of. Lines stretch into the street, literally. Lots of attitude and no work ethic."
1546,6324,"By far the worst Caribbean Airport I have ever arrived at. Immigration slower than Antigua(3 times), St Lucia and Grenada . Told ONE arrival card per family -NO one each luckily I didn't listen and did one each, but with tens of passengers filling in extra forms having been turned back(Monarchs fault here).Baggage carousel couldn't cope. On way back Monarch crew arrived after the passengers (despite having the same week holiday as US) so are in by duty free with the pax very unprofessional. This is a report for 2013"
1547,6328,Good Can Be Better
1548,6330,"old, typical Arab airport. We survived it ;)"
1549,6332,Most stores were closed. Staff have us conflicting messages about where the open bank was to the extent we concluded there wasn't one. All UK bound passengers were made to move through to the gate area where again there were no facilities. Would not go again if I could help it
1550,6333,"Not a nice airport. Filthy toilets, stupid priced food and drinks in the ONE restaurant, absolute rip off. Cheap duty free."
1551,6334,Nice airport but nobody informed us you our flight you need to change DINAR before you go through security OR that the exit part of your visa needs to be completed before security. The other thing is they don't take Scottish notes - a bit annoying when it's all you've got on you. Toilets are disgusting and when the attendant offers you a towel you have to pay them! They sneak up on you like ninjas and you kinda go .. ok then out comes the hand for payment.
1552,6346,"The terminal is too old, chaos on check-in... but there is a place to have a cigarette, that means its not too bad)"
1553,6347,Very bad!
1554,6348,Active airport :)
1555,6349,good airport but little flight
1556,6353,"No wifi, no available public transportation to the airport, you have to remove your shoes for the security check, during the check in the guy wanted to get a bribe."
1557,6356,"In the lounge you've apparently never heard of alliances and status recognition, but the food and drink you buy is outrageously expensive. 3.50 euros for 0.25 liter can of cola??"
1558,6357,"Probably the worst airport I have ever been to! Be prepared for queueing and queueing and queueing...Despite having a mobile boarding pass you need to go to the check-in desks (and queue!) in order to get a printed boarding pass which is going to be looked at by a lot persons who are literally waiting in line! The absolute horror is the passport control: Almost one hour to get through it in a cramped, way too warm and oppressive hall. WiFi is not working although they are praising it everywhere. In shops, foreigners are urged to pay in Euro. What a terrible experience..."
1559,6358,Screens didn’t show my flight. The gatenumber on my boarding pass turned out to be wrong. Nobody knew where to go. What a mess
1560,6361,"The worst airport I have ever been. Dirty, dirty toilets, no trash bins, wifi to which is almost impossible to connect to, no power sockets (!), rude custom officials employees, unhelpful staff who is expecting tips everytime. Watch out for taxi drivers who are cheating on you (even when you are using taxis from official point)."
1561,6363,Not ANY sarvices after security control except one automat. No bars or restaurants. One bar before security which also closed too early.
1562,6364,"As there's a new airport under construction in the region, adana / sakirpasa airport is not renovated and stays very small and not a funny airport. Not too many Facilities or food choices etc.. loos very busy as it is serving approx 3 flights a hour in a very small terminal"
1563,6381,Enormeous baggage handling/check in problems. 2h waiting time! Baggages are not delivered to destination.
1564,6384,"If you are looking to be packed like cattle while waiting for your plane, then Antalya airport is the place for you. Absolutely horrible design for Terminal 2, nowhere to buy phone chargers nor any reading material, something my smaller airport Newcastle does easily! Horrible airport, far too overcrowded, in desperate need of improvement."
1565,6388,"There is nothing to to at the gate's, only a few shop's. It was really really hot inside the airco wasn't good."
1566,6391,"No pay - no go. Even with small children you need to wait in the row before passport/security control (or pay 30 E/person for ""fast track""). For baggage cart you also need to pay, cash only."
1567,6394,"Too many security checks and long, slow queues. Hugely expensive food and drink once in departure area and not enough seating."
1568,6395,"no option to buy water ! only one broken machine with drinks. Only 3 points with water for 2,5 EUR (0,5L), sick !! the queue to that points was terrible."
1569,6398,"Security check just after entering the terminal, but only one ""check"" open. Very long passport control - 2 people for about 400 passengers. 2nd security check after passport control - very, very long - one ""check"" open for all passengers. Nevertheless, terminal is quite new and comfortable. It is hard to buy non-alcoholic drinks."
1570,6404,"Too busy, not enough tables and chairs for the amount of people at the airport at 11pm - 1am. Gate kept changing so we had to move multiple times and there was no organisation between staff, who seemed like they didn't know what they were doing."
1571,6405,"Free Wi-Fi only at the entrance area by the counters and only for checked-in people. Had a connection flight and had to stay at the airport for 5h before the next flight, couldn't connect to Wi-Fi as check-in only opened 2h before the flight, and surprisingly at the waiting area the wi-fi was only paid"
1572,6423,"This is disaster. If you are flying on the first flight of the day and arrive on the airport before midnight, forget you can go through passport control and security. You can't. even you have online checkin done. My flight was leaving at 4:10 am, OLCI done, I am *A Gold, so I wanted to use nonstop lounge which is at this airport but passport control did not let me through because every flight is in their system only 3hrs before departure. What the hell? So I had to wait 4 hours, at 01:10 I went to passport control again and there was nobody..I was waiting there another hour when someone finally come and start checks. This is really bad, really bad..never again here."
1573,6428,"It is the only terminal in the world designed so that the apron is not visible. There cannot be such a ridiculous building. Also, bellows should have been built for that building."
1574,6430,The current airport is pretty small but they are building the new international terminal. It'll be very decent this summer :)

1577,6439,"Security staff so unfriendly. Terrible! One told me to park my car at a place. I did. The next one comes and told me to remove my car. He shows me, where I had to park it. I did it and the next one comes and told me to remove my car and he shows me the first place where I was to park my car there. I was so angry about that stupid and arrogant guys. Give people a little bit power and they use it to show you, that they have and you not."
1578,6441,"Poor airport, few facilities"
1579,6442,"As usual aerodrom, big one, but in good shape ;)"
1580,6443,"Arrived and got through passport control incredibly slow. They switched staff 5 minutes after our flight came in, and seemed they needed to log off and back on which took (not exaggerating) about 20 minutes. Following this, we went through and saw an unattended bag sat around for 15 minutes. Reported it to 5 different people, 3 different security guards and no one cared, just told us to report it to someone else. Avoid the airport. Not good"
1581,6446,"This flight, the Check-in counter sfaff's behavior was terrible. Since we request the seat for three-couple seat, but he gave seat for devide us. Also, he called someone while I was Check-in"

1584,6449,Security Screening before entering the airport are rude and cannot speak to them for no reason. The camra was stuck in the bag and the security person kept yanking at the lens to take it out at which i scolded the person to stop and gave me an angry look. Eventually i was allowed to remove the camera myself to prevent her damaging it. Totally unprofessional young staff who have no clue and uncorteuos with what they are doing when checking the bags.
1585,6456,"What a mess, they obviously opened way too soon, nothing works, it's un-co-ordinated and the staff are so bloody rude, terrible, enough to make me re-consider trips to Turkey in the future"
1586,6458,"The new Istanbul airport is poor. First, the free Wifi needed password which was sent by SMS. But I could not receive SMS sometimes. Second, many people jump the queue in the security check and no one there to maintain order"
1587,6461,"Wifi not able to connect with foreign cellphone, facilities minimal. Airport is just a megalomania without any usability"
1588,6464,"An extremely frustrating airport experience. Security checks are required even during layovers. The place is overcrowded and outrageously expensive. A simple sandwich and soda combo costs 17 euros, supposedly on promotion from 19! All the restaurants and fast-food options have exorbitant prices. Surprisingly, the term 'Terrace' doesn't refer to an outdoor observation area; instead, it's an indoor smoking lounge, contributing to the entire airport reeking like a giant ashtray."""

1593,6472,"no electric or usb plugs for charging the phones, very dirty airport, lack of comfortable and clean seats at some gates, complicated connection to wifi"
1594,6480,"Even though we arrived on a domestic flight from Istanbul, our luggage was returned in the International Terminal without us knowing it. We waited at the baggage claim in the Domestic Terminal for ages, then had to walk a very long path to the international baggage claim. Bad organisation and unnecessary wait times. Departure lounge in the International Terminal is very basic."
1595,6481,"It must be a Turkish thing, rude staff, nothing works properly especially if you arrive late evening, take a fligth from overseas and connect through IST, make sure you collect your baggage in IST otherwise when you arrive in ADB even on a domestic flight you will have to walk a country mile to collect your baggage from the International terminal and pray to the lord your baggage is there, bloody hopeless"
1596,6485,Tiny domestic airport with one gate for all flights (because there are such little flights) Minimal food options ...But you don’t need to be there more than an hour before the flight
1597,6509,"A primitive airport. Very few services. Passengers have to walk about 50 meters from the aircraft to the terminal. It was raining heavily after arrival, so I go soaked, and my baggage also arrived wet."
1598,6524,"Welcome to Providenciales! As soon as you arrive, you will be welcomed by rude employees at this location. I took a picture of an ad and one employee was beyond rude and threatening. What a great way to welcome who brings money to pay their bills. With the exception of the immigration services, you are in for a treat. No A/C, internet doesn’t work. It only has the bare minimum. Be careful with the baggage handlers outside. They are not employees of any company and will demand tips. Do not tip or allow them to handle your bags. Food service is extremely limited. Bathrooms are surprisingly clean though. Nice terrace upstairs to see the planes coming in/out which also has a rooftop bar."
1599,6525,"Cons: Dirty, No Retail/Food, Wifi: N/A, No Lounge, Confusing Customs, Little help on baggage claim, Pros: The Staff Were Nice."
1600,6527,"Very small airport, they gave us some imigratuon forms in the plane but they wanted to fill us another ones when we arrived, weird."
1601,6530,very small airport with to much flights at the same time. Very long line for security check
1602,6532,"Entebbe Airport, serving as Uganda's primary international gateway, disappointingly falls short of the expected standards. The airport's outdated facilities are a significant concern, especially considering its role as the country's entry point. A lack of basic comforts for passengers is starkly noticeable. One of the most pressing issues is the inconvenient access to the terminal. Vehicles are required to stop a considerable distance away, forcing passengers to walk at least 100 meters, often while dragging luggage and navigating ramps. This becomes particularly problematic during rain, as only VIPs or VVIPs are allowed closer access, leaving others exposed to the elements. Regarding specific aspects of the airport experience: - Road Access: The toll road leading to the airport is in excellent condition, a stark contrast to the airport itself. - Check-in: The check-in process is passable but could benefit from reduced waiting times. - Security Check: The security checkpoints, requiring passengers to exit their vehicles for metal detector screening, seem inefficient. This process overlooks the possibility of drivers carrying prohibited items in the vehicle. - Terminal Facilities: The terminal offers minimal amenities for those waiting for flights. The VIP lounge is the only refuge for a modicum of comfort. - Wi-Fi: The presence and quality of Wi-Fi service are unclear, but it seemed virtually non-existent. - Food and Retail Services: Options for dining and shopping are severely limited. In summary, Entebbe Airport is in dire need of an overhaul. The current state of the airport, with its outdated facilities and lack of basic amenities, provides a less-than-ideal experience for travelers. A new passenger terminal is under construction, which brings a glimmer of hope. However, it isn't likely to be completed before the second half of 2024. This delay in modernizing the airport further exacerbates the current dissatisfaction."

1604,6534,"A Depressing Ordeal at Entebbe Airport Having recently had the misfortune of traveling through Entebbe Airport, I find it my duty to warn fellow travelers about the horrors that lie in wait. The moment you step foot inside, it becomes clear that you've made a grave mistake. The passenger terminal is nothing short of appalling. Imagine the smallest, most ill-equipped bus station you've ever had the displeasure of visiting, multiply that discomfort by ten, and you might begin to approach the woeful conditions of this place. There is no suitable structure to accommodate the rush of travelers, and the amenities are just as sparse. My ill-fated choice to fly with Turkish Airlines and Ethiopian merely amplified my troubles. In a twist of fate that, in hindsight, seems entirely predictable, my luggage did not arrive with my flight. Given the obvious shortcomings of the airport, I wasn't surprised, just disappointed. The situation devolved further as I attempted to retrieve my lost baggage. The baggage claim staff, if one can indeed refer to them as such, were lackadaisical at best and negligent at worst. Slow to react, devoid of any motivation, and exuding an aura of casual indifference, they made the agonizing ordeal of a lost luggage even more tormenting. Their evident lack of commitment and professionalism did not instill any confidence in their ability to perform their duties effectively. Adding insult to injury, if your luggage happens to arrive in a damaged state - a scenario that, given my experience, seems more likely than not - their response is simply that they can do nothing. As if losing one's luggage wasn't stressful enough, to hear that any damages incurred will not be accounted for is a disheartening blow. It's a trial of patience to assert your rights and make any headway in this chaotic environment. One needs to be prepared to go through the rigmarole of collecting every possible shred of documentation and evidence, and then engage the airline in your home country's court. In summary, Entebbe Airport is a veritable nightmare of inefficiency, apathy, and disorganization. It's a stark contrast to the tranquility and beauty of Uganda itself. Travellers beware: if you value your peace of mind and your possessions, avoid this airport at all costs."
1605,6537,It's simply and experience on many levels and I hope you don't have to commute in and out of it frequently.
1606,6539,"Entebbe Airport in Uganda is not the best airport in my opinion, it lacked some facilties which are fundamental. I do not recommend this airport. Almost everything was in poor condition and check points were very slow."
1607,6540,"First of all you have to go out of your car and walk through a security check just to get to the edge of the property, which causes a big traffic line. Then you have to go through another security check just to enter the terminal! (regardless of weather or not you are travelling) After check in you go through passport control and a duty free store and then yet another security check at the gates. The worst part is that If you buy drinks they are expensive and only come in big bottles. This is extremely inconvenient as you have to throw away the bottle thus wasting money. overall very old, and extremely disorganised airport."
1608,6543,"Awful as it is - never flying on time, sullen faces and totally f***-up tarmac. Absolutely disgusting and well NOT worth the visit. Unless you want to find yourself in a country-side-like but terribly overprice airport, go there and see it with your own eyes."
1609,6544,"The airport is shit. Flew to Moscow. Upon arrival, I found my luggage turned upside down. They were hanging around before boarding the plane at the Dnepropetrovsk airport. Rats work at the Dnepropetrovsk airport. Keep in mind!"
1610,6545,Dull airport
1611,6546,"I took off from this airport in January, 2014. New modern airport. It is a lot of parking spaces on the parking. Fast passing of customs. Now is in the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic. The Donetsk airport was completely destroyed in 2015 by the Ukrainian troops and nazi armed groups."
1612,6547,One of the best airports was destroyed in battles by Russian invaders.
1613,6549,"Ukrainian nazi regime destroyed airport, more than 2K people were killed there . It's a tragedy nowadays. Just in the center of Europe... They killed even children in schools nearby , explaining that they are fighting with Putin and so called "" russian troops"""
1614,6551,"The airport doesn't exist any more. It was completely destroyed by russian occupants in autumn/winter 2014. It will be never forgotten and never forgiven. Down with fucking russia! As there is no such thing as Donetsk Airport, maybe it should be removed from this site?"
1615,6552,"Iliya Gruzinov is a fat liar. Donetsk airport was destroyed by russian terrorists with the support of the Russian army. Ukrainian soldiers initially defended the airport and continue to defend it now. But Russian terrorists continues airport shelling from residential areas of the Donetsk, using a weapon that delivers them to Ukraine by putin."
1616,6553,"Airport totally destroyed by Ukrainian fascists in 2014. it`s terrible, because before airport was The Best in Ukraine. This situation happens by EU support of Ukranian nazism. I think at this moment we can remove this cemetry from airtports databases"
1617,6555,No business lounge
1618,6561,"Be careful with the information desk who offer to order ""official"" taxi for you - it's a scam and you end up with the guys charging you 3 times more than you should pay. It's better to order taxi/transfer via your hotel."
1619,6563,Staff don't know English in domestic terminal. It's look awful. Domestic terminal is not suitable for disabled people
1620,6568,"I found it very difficult to get to the airport, I still haven't reached the airport with my fellow passengers, despite the pilots best efforts in trying. Customs have been particularly hard of late for me to clear, not only here, but internationally for some reason. I also have been told I won't be able to claim anything when I reach the airport, though I hear that the facilities are great, it just seems I'm just not wanted here."
1621,6572,"Very easy to get into country, no problems at custom, used diplomatic & crew gate. Very warm staff but terminal is not nice."
1622,6573,A lots of nationalists and nationalist accessories. But you can see these are the realities and modern values of Ukraine!
1623,6575,"A Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) flight crashed shortly after taking off from the Iranian capital Tehran on 8 January, killing all 176 passengers and crew members on board."
1624,6577,Borispol airport Terminal F is a total disaster. Check-in girl was rude and unfriendly. There are no duty free shops or restaurants anywhere in that terminal even after the passport control. It was definitely my worst travel experience ever.
1625,6581,"Very difficult to give anymore than this, as its a very small airport and I think again one of these places that needs to move with the times and provide the capacity for the volume it is dealing with. I know this is a second tier airport serving Kyiv and Ukraine, but it does have a lot of regular traffic from budget airlines, so lot of volume. Check in area, very limited and small with limited seating and not much on offer amenity wise. Security very comprehensive but time consuming as it was one person at a time through a barrier, not like most places where everyone grabs their bins and keeps moving. But if it makes it safer no complaints, just a slow process. Then get past security and into the waiting area and again its fairly small and tight and I was there at 0500 for an early flight in winter, I can imagine what it would be like middle of the day during peak season in Summer or Spring. Getting there though easy enough from Kyiv central in an Uber, pretty much pull up outsider front doors to terminal."
1626,6583,"The worst airport I have ever been! Staff can't help with anything, always ignoring, I'm local, but they just refuse to help us to solve problem which was made from their side! There was no name card on that guy jacket, so I can't tell who was he, but he made our trip super complicated!"
1627,6588,"Arriving is not organized at all, there are crowds instead of queues, no information to arriving passengers. We stood in queue on Passport control, and border guard or other airport workers just took foreign people from one queue to another, they brought 5 people to the beginning of our queue in front of us, each minute we become further from the passport control instead of being closer. There are no separate lines for foreigners and for Ukrainians, instead of that they just took people from one queue to another. There is a complete chaos, while the airport itself is small and easy for understanding and there are no many people inside it."
1628,6589,The worst airport ever which i have ever been in. Passport controllers acted like pigs and they make us wait 4 hours because of we are from Turkey
1629,6591,"No places to sleep in case of ovenight connections, the seats are pretty uncomfortable for that. Food is not good as well"
1630,6597,"Nice, clean and very airy airport."
1631,6601,"When departing, the ticket in the application was not enough, at this airport it is necessary to have a paper ticket. The check-in staff was nice, but that's the only plus point of the airport. After passing through the inspection, there is no shop in the area, and you cannot buy or drink. WiFi is there but it didn't work."
1632,6602,"The local customs control received a tip about me after my arrival, so they waited for me with their dogs right after my arrival, and I received an excessively detailed inspection. They played tough guys and of course they left sad, but based on this experience I can't give a positive review."
1633,6604,"Security is a one huge mistake - no english, no english clarification, and no understanding of basic math: the security officer informed me that 0,1l is more than 100ml, so I can't take it to the plane. Oh, great. And then it was a point of discussion with 3 officer in the same time, while any of them try to bother with speaking english. (apart of it: taxi to the airport it was quite cheap, internet was working, and 4am was crowded, full of people with queue to both security as a check in - poor organised)"

1635,6615,"IMPORTANT NOTICE: Upon Crimea peninsula occupied by Russia, anyone arriving onto Crimea not through the territory of Ukraine considered as a crime by the Government of Ukraine/ Any passenger arriving via Simferopol airport therefore considered as a criminal by the Government of Ukraine. Pls be aware Important notice: According to the legislation of Ukraine, foreigners are allowed to cross the occupied territories only with special passes and through special entry points. Thus, all persons arriving on the territory of the ARC through Simieropolskoye litovyshte and the Kerch ferry crossing violate the legislation of Ukraine with the corresponding consequences."
1636,6617,The airport is within the part of Ukraine which is occupied by russia. There is no way to maintain or ensure any air safety protocols due to complete ban on any relations of the airport with Ukrainian and international organizations. Thus the airport should be avoided at any cost.
1637,6622,It's hard to call it an airport. rather looks like a bus station somewhere in an abandoned village.
1638,6623,"Damn it, not the airport... They don’t take your luggage at check-in, but you drag it to security control yourself. Almost everything is old and shabby (although there are signs of renovation in some places). BUT! Thank you very much to the airport and its management that it still functions (albeit in a deplorable state!) It was very convenient to fly directly from Zaporozhye. So these little things can be tolerated in exchange for significant savings in time and effort)"
1639,6624,The border guards went completely wild with boredom. The toilets are terrible. There are huge sandwiches in the cafe.
1640,6631,Small old airport where for most flights you have to bus to the terminal. Terminal is cramped and not particularly clean
1641,6633,"Transit passenger, very unorganised and security check on the face of it was a bit pointless. Nothing needed to be taken out of hand luggage."
1642,6634,"Possibly the worst airport I've been to. Too crowded, poorly organized, not enough seats or basic facilities."
1643,6635,"Very small for volume of flights and thus very crowded. Quite dated, not very clean. Most of the flights seem to be (de)boarded by bus, which is given local temperatures somewhat face-slapping. Security are ""UAE standard"" pleasant (ie. meh)."
1644,6641,"I didn't liked traveling by bus between terminal 2 and terminal 3, It was my first time on plane and my first international trip."
1645,6647,"Such a bad airport. Nothing works, you need o buy a card for bus in a store which is totally hidden, without any signs. They only accept cash. While we live in 2019 this airport stuck in 1980. Fuck DWC"
1646,6648,"When you are travelling with the hand luggage only, you cannot proceed to the security check immediately. You must go through the check-in anyway as their system is not integrated with the carriers systems..."
1647,6653,One of the worst experiences of my travelling life - and i work there DNATA - what do they actually do? Check-in on behalf of QR very rude Delivered us to the wrong aircraft on the bus on departure Baggage delivery on arrival useless
1648,6654,Nothing good about this airport. Have to wait 3 hours for baggage! I feel like at third world country. People yelling and quarrel with airport staff who can't give a solid reason on baggage delay. The trip to airport killed me. I hate this airport so much!
1649,6664,"Sharjah Airport is an old, dull looking airport with very little facilities The only security check we've been through was one before you entered the gates area, other than that, no security checks. Other than the Duty Free, the only place you could get food from was one or two restaurants. Upon arrival, we found long, crowded and slow immigration and customs. No Wi-Fi was offered. Getting to the airport is hard if you don't have a GPS because of lack of street signs. Overall 2/5."
1650,6665,"It was one of my worst check-in experience on departure and worst immigration experience on arrival. Even though they have eye-scan system at every counter, they choose not to enable it and one few counters were performing it. though other counters were manned but they were sitting idle and talking to each other. The same situation on check-in with Airline staff"
1651,6672,"As a small regional airport you shouldn't really expect much but as my regional and local airport I was disappointed. I travelled on a Thursday morning and was expecting some queues however found that the staff were working slower than everyone else at the airport which is really poor considering how much you pay for the ticket and that you are travelling with a scheduled airline. Despite undergoing transformation, the airport still seems to offer the same basic facilities and does not seem to have improved on it's offer to passengers considering there is just a larger duty free shopping area. Boarding was very slow and we did end up leaving late because of slow boarding and slow cabin crew."
1652,6676,"In need of rebuilding, the terminal feels cramped and check-in is dire, specifically for the BA flights, two on the desks and over 40 waiting to check in at 9AM. Despite all the demands for fees, I see little investment in the airports infrastructure."
1653,6683,"Not a great airport. Masquerades as international but not ideal to cope with the level of traffic. Belfast International (BFS) is superior and easier to use, albeit a little further from the city centre"
1654,6695,Main lounge area too small and crowded for its own good. Airport itself services by a thrice hourly bus from the city centre for £8.50 single. Seating throughout is uncomfortable metal seating. Most of the airport in dire need of refurbishment. Some staff abrupt bordering on rude.
1655,6698,"Terrible security control with only two counters open! Boarding at the gate not friendly as you're being placed in a closed group waiting space, with no access to vending machines or other food services."
1656,6701,"Late-ish flight on Sunday night - all the food outlets were closed or closing. Not enough seating, poor PA announcements and shambolic queues for departure gates. A terrible little airport"
1657,6704,"Airport was busy, two toilets were closed and another had blocked toilers overflowing onto the floor. The terminal (check-in) smelt strongly of petrol/exhaust from construction. The place was a mess."
1658,6706,Awful security delays (again). Paid for fast track and got a long queue. Ended up running for the plane.
1659,6711,"Sadly as my local airport, bhx has gone down in experience recently. Terminal is hot & stuffy with underpowered Air Conditioning, staff were late to gate 59, which led to a wait of about 30 mins in a hot, stuffy corridor. Just a bad experience all round :("
1660,6714,not a very good airport at all. had to walk to terminal in rain and got soaked. then 10 minutes until bags came round. no staff to be seen whatsoever. not spoken to by anyone simply awful setup although landing and takeoff were one redeeming quality
1661,6716,"Very convenient, it feels like the airport is in the town centre. However, the airport itself is on a par with Malavane airport in Maputo, Mozambique, Very poor and in urgent need of investment."
1662,6719,"Could do with expanding, and MORE flights to different destinations, ALL year round."
1663,6724,"This is our local airport but it is very badly managed. Over full car parks even though you have pre-booked, lousy phone connectivity and one of the slowest arrivals procedures (immigration and baggage reclaim) of any UK airport. The airport has increased the number of flights and available destinations which is great but the management need to take urgent steps to cater for the increased passenger numbers."
1664,6731,how can someone say this is the best UK airport and the 3rd best airport in the World? who made the survey? chavs?
1665,6735,Remote car rental center with a bus every quarter of an hour is such a disgrace. Terminal is also just too small and overcrowded.
1666,6740,"No possibility to reach connecting flights without going through security again. No plugs whatsoever next to the seating options either, only a paid powerbank option. Avoid at all cost."
1667,6754,"I arrived at Cradiff on September 9th, the arrivals terminal building is dated and very unpleasing, Immigration was quite fast, provided that mine was the only Extra-Schengen flight. Baggage claim area is really unpleasing, there is not even a monitor telling you which is the right baggage carousel. Baggage claim took almost 30 minutes, which is ridiculous given the size of the airport. There is a good shuttle service both to Cardiff Central Station and to the nearby Rhoose station (trains to Cardiff Central leave from there). All in all there is room for improvement."
1668,6759,"Small airport, free WiFi (registration needed)"
1669,6770,"Aircraft was parked well away from the terminal building and passengers had to follow a member of staff back to the terminal in the pouring rain. No other aircraft at the terminal, decision to park so far away a bit baffling . All else ok."
1670,6785,"Terrible ""Aldi"" Airport. Takes ages for baggage to be unloaded If you like being shouted at by the security staff during the screening, then this is the place for you. It used to be a really nice airport, but Gordon Dewar has transformed this to a horrible place to fly to. I try to use ABZ these days."
1671,6791,"Return Trip to Dub take off delayed, waiting on ramp for light aicraft to clear space for 20 mins. Surely commercial should take precedence"
1672,6795,"What a terrible airport. Poor facilities, the worst organisation and to be avoided at all costs. The management should spend some time at a ""proper"" airport and see how things should be done. Security needs a complete review."
1673,6812,An airport that provides a hassle free experience in terms of low queuing. However the facilities are appalling.
1674,6824,"Small Airport but very cnvenient to Brigg, my departure town. Humberside is within half a mile of a main railway line and cold do with a train link. This will surely help with its development."
1675,6843,Horrendously unfriendly staff
1676,6847,"Had to wait over an hour on the plane, at the stand, for a bus to drive us about 30 yards. Infuriating after an early arrival. Long queue for passport after that, no e-gates."
1677,6853,Service is really slow. I flew in a holiday period and our flight was delayed by 1 hour due to staffing shortages. The same guy who was loading bags on the plane also had to drive the vehicle to push back the plane.
1678,6854,"I've spent over 1.5h in line to security check. Only two security lines, with very short tables/lines with plastic boxes, so only few people can prepare to scans at the same time."
1679,6855,"It took well over an hour just to get to the gate, slow is not the word as only one entry gate was open and coming home was just as bad."
1680,6863,Charge for a single ziplock plastic liquids bag and wont let you pass unless you purchase one. Not many facilities to make use of.
1681,6869,"Showed to the 2 attendants that check your status at the check-in queue my boarding pass and I said I can go to the Priority queue as I have BA Silver, then said ""but you're World Traveller, ouch"" and started laughing. A BA Luxury experience as always ha!. After a more senior showed up and allowed me to Priority, the check-in lady was very nice and efficient. Security at this airport is always chaotic and expect anything between 2min to 1hr to clear it."
1682,6870,Security takes a while to get through and it takes unfortunately multiple trays to put all of your baggage in to get scanned
1683,6874,"LCY is not a transit airport. Due to a cancellation, I had to change flights in LCY. Having already cleared security at GLA with no issues, I then had to go through security again. LCY security is a tiny space. I got through the barrier and then the attendant stopped anyone else getting through the barrier due to the queue being so backed-up. As usual, I had my tablet and liquids out of my bag ready for scanning. One of the attendants told me that I didn't have to, so I put them back in the bag. It got pulled and what was the thing that they wanted to check, yes my tablet. There was a constant group of four passengers waiting at the end on the conveyor belt waiting for their bags to be checked. there were two attendants doing the checking and most of the bags seemed to be checked very quickly, but they were arriving constantly and they never did clear the backlog. They really have to do something about the sensitivity of the machines. Once after the stress of security there was plenty of free seats up the left side of the departure lounge, which didn't seem to be used much from departures. It the allotted time I went to the gate that I was leaving from, The area was tiny, with few seats. I stood along the corridor, but from there the announcements were very mute."
1684,6876,Totally inappropriate advertisement of London City airport - it shame to see such a concept in 2020.
1685,6886,"Not so many chairs for this kind if large airports, prices at shop it's so huge ( pack of cigarettes £22)"
1686,6887,I cannot believe one of the world's greatest cities has an airport as dysfunctional as Heathrow. Even the local Brits were complaining about the madhouse the place was.
1687,6889,"LHR T5 is a dirty hell hole, I don't think it has ever been cleaned since it was built, dust and dirt on every surface. I feel embarrassed that this is the welcome and first impression that visitors get to the UK. Planes are always late taking off and on my last 3 trips we've had to wait for the ramp guidance system to be turned on. It's not like they didn't know we were coming!!! And worse still is over £13 to park for an hour, and £5 just for the privilege of dropping someone off. It's criminal that they bleed their customers of cash at every opportunity. And have to mention that baggage reclaim is a joke. Dont rush through immigration (if you get the chance) because your bag with the priority bag tag will be the last one out after at least an hour of waiting."
1688,6892,Terminal 5 is awful. Never made a connection there; always packed and delays getting the aircraft to a gate.
1689,6898,"The lounge is fine, I've can stay and wait his flight. Menu is always the pasta con carne and the""fancy"" beans. Checking in procedure is a shamble, they let go the priority passengers and keeping them like castles on the stairs."
1690,6901,"Probably the worst of the major London airports. Disorganized and chaotic; every time it’s taken forever in security, which are clearly understaffed. Not enough seats in the airport and the shop and restaurant options are poor."
1691,6904,"Good airport, stayed night before and loved the premier inn experience. Good airport in general though. Lost my bag however."
1692,6918,No mens toilets in main departure area this time. Facilties were grubby. Staff services were good and efficient though.
1693,6919,"Stansted is the worst airport ever. Two and a half hours getting there. Stansted Express is a Scam, that permits you to pay tapping your card, but once arrived people of the check control says that is forbidden, and charge you a insane fee. The slowest security control ever. We spent more than a hour only in that! We waited more than a hour in front of the aircraft"
1694,6921,"Flights are cheap but parking is ridiculously expensive, better value overall to pay more for flights and use a different airport."
1695,6922,Just way too busy. Much too many flights and people. There were two cancellations while we were there and the place filled up really quickly with the extra bodies hanging around.
1696,6932,"Terminal 2 is brilliant, new, better circulation and security with nicer lighting and departures area. feels new. T3 and T1 are horrific, old, with poor circulation, awful security, no natural lighting, outdated interiors, and looks like a remnant of the war that hasn't been torn down despite being far past its 'best before' date. looking forward to the refurbishment and expansion to be completed as it will hopefully bring the whole airport into the 21st century."
1697,6936,"No airport comes close to MAN for being the worst airport that has ever existed. Off the plane you could see a member of the ground crew looking thoroughly hacked off at being forced to 'work' at gunpoint no doubt. Immigration was swift - though it was New Years Eve AND we were the only flight in the bus station aka T3. Still, it took over thirty minutes for the bags to arrive....well done MAN."
1698,6940,Person in security screening was rude in my opinion. The only airside outlet was Coffee Republic and was cash only. No warning.
1699,6952,"We had to deplane to go through customs as the first point of arrival in UK from Jersey. What a farce. Walk through to baggage reclaim past an apparently unstaffed 'customs post', into land-side, recheck bags at Loganair desk and go back through security, to sit by the boarding point to be first back onto the plane. And this experience cost us £10 each by way of 'airport development fee'!"
1700,6961,"Just a typical low cost airport. Dropoff and pick up is a total rip-off and half the time the boom is stuck. Security checkpoints are a complete hit and miss and usually understaffed. They also love to mess you around with the bag x-ray, very inconsistent. In busy the airport is a complete shambles because they have far too many movements fro what they can effectively handle, people wise. Arrivals is joke, again far too many people for such a rubbish little arrivals hall before immigration. All in all just a rubbish airport but then again this is for a regular flyer i.e. weekly, for holiday once a year its probably bearable. Wifi never works and only thing they seem to serve in quantity is alcohol."
1701,6964,"the security area was completely packed with people, with more than about 15 lanes (visual estimate), and only 5 were open. the staff had to let people come down the corridor to the area a handful at a time, to stop overcrowding I presume. I think it's safe to say they failed at that. But it's not wholly the fault of the staff, the labour shortages are also at fault, but there were more than adequate staff shepherding us down a very simple corridor and not enough manning the lanes. not the greatest experience."
1702,6966,Going to Malaga was amazing Coming back was dreadful. Stuck on the plane for 15/20 mins due to no buses (apparently they were shocked by our 5 min early arrival) Customs was a nightmare. Took FOREVER to get through. Despite having 2 children under 12. Baggage was quick. Waiting for the bus to take us back to the car park. Oh my god. They had stopped the buses. Meaning we had how many people waiting for one minibus. It was a shambles. Never again
1703,6968,Terrible Border control! This airport is so slow for everything. Parking costs £2 for 10 mins in rapid and £1 for every min there after. Security is a joke and the airport has nothing in it. Unfortunately my local airport.
1704,6969,It took 30 minutes to get through immigration at midnight. Families with tired young children having to wait. Terrible
1705,6971,"Although Brize Norton is a military facility, it does have a small number of scheduled flights that civilians can buy tickets for, mainly to Ascention Island and the Falklands. I guess that's why it's on here."
1706,6972,A military base no civilian facilities. There is no access to the base without a pass. The terminal has a small shop and there is car hire available. All handling is by the military
1707,6973,Why is Brize Norton on here when it is not a public airport. But a RAF Aerodrome.
1708,6995,It's on my doorstep . . . just wish it had a few more options.
1709,6996,"Basic airport, but with good bus service to Darlington BR."
1710,7006,"TSA lines early in the morning are painfully long. Only 2 of the 4 scanners are open despite people queueing up for 30 minutes. Flights into and out of Albany are often cancelled. Other than Southwest, airlines mostly operate small RJ aircraft that force cancellations more often."
1711,7007,"TSA early in the morning has possibly the worst line backed up out of any US airport. It is there every day and the TSA seems to think they are below average. It often takes over 1 hour to get to security. Once there, they have 2 of 5 scanners working. These are not smart people."
1712,7018,-
1713,7034,The non TSA pre check line was +1hour long. Passengers were going to the front of the line to avoid missing their flight. Get there 2 hours early if you need to return a car and/or check luggage.
1714,7040,What a shit show starting with Delta lost in managing queues for checkin counters and baggage drops. Most uncomfortable experience so far this year.
1715,7041,"Very poorly signed, with no elevated signs indicating the locations of the shuttle or Uber pick-up locations (signage only found in the form of stickers on the floor by the escalators...very easy to miss). Overall, the airport seemed crowded and not very ergonomic in design."
1716,7045,"Loved all the shopping and dining options, and how modern and clean ATL looked, but literally had the worst customs/TSA experience ever here"
1717,7073,"under construction, but all ok should be good when its done"
1718,7086,birmingham
1719,7095,"There are almost no food / drink options before going through security at this airport. I had to wait for a delayed flight for about 5 hours, and couldn't get through security for a few hours because I also had a bag to check in, so I was stuck out there"
1720,7102,"We had a somewhat miserable time at BOS as we spent over 10 hours there due to delays. While this isn't indicative of everyone's experience, our was not good."
1721,7119,"What an awful airport. It's small, the staff fulfill the worst of American stereotypes, sleeping there is a thoroughly unpleasant experience with hardly any amenities, and the constant blaring of the TVs fills your unconscious with right-wing propaganda."
1722,7120,Much bigger airport than I expected
1723,7128,Came here instead of LAX
1724,7144,Airport is under heavy constructions. Very few restaurants and shops only. Two piers despite the fact CHS is very small. Still cosy what I apreciate about airports in the southeast
1725,7146,"Not a bad little airport, but being stuck there for 5 hours waiting for a replacement aircraft was torture. Free wifi and pleasant staff, though."
1726,7155,Everywhere you look there is a line. Bathroom? yep. Baggage claim? yep. I got stuck in a line trying to simply exit the terminal. Like the door to exit wasn't enough for the amount of foot traffic. Hate this place with a passion.
1727,7156,I have flown arrived and departed from 16 different airports. This one is the worst. Airport is permanently under construction (not uncommon for a large airport). TSA is straight up rude at CLT. Wifi is very slow. Way overcrowded.
1728,7167,"THE MOST EXPENSIVE AIRPORT I HAVE EVER TRAVELED THROUGH! BRING PLENTY OF $$$$$ IF YOU PLAN OF GETTING ANY FOOD, EVEN FAST FOOD! TERRIBLE RIP OFF!"
1729,7168,"Ground agent unfriendly, counted my poster tube the 3rd carry-on. I had to de-assemble the tupe and put them into my bag to make the carry-on 2."
1730,7175,"Execrable assistance service for PRMs. They help you out of the plane, take you in a wheelchair to a place in Terminal B and tell you, sorry we don't know how to go down the escalator, you have to go to your gate yourself. in terminal C located several hundred meters away."
1731,7180,Staff at the airport are rude. There are no clear signs to help travellers find their way inside the terminal and the staff are not friendly. I had a stressful experience at this airport.
1732,7187,"Convoluted exit after baggage collection as you have to go through security again to exit. After customs and baggage collection you enter a security area where your bag is put on a conveyer belt that sends your bag to the carousel upstairs, but then you go through security, including liquids check, before exiting to the carousels. This is because you join departing passengers in the airport, hence the security checks. Airport not really set up for international arrivals."
1733,7188,"CVG is normally a very efficient airport. Today, I was greeted by the rudest, most unprofessional Delta ticket agent who was also abusing every piece of luggage I saw her touch. TSA pre was closed, but the pre line was not blocked off, so you just ended up walking to an unmanned station with no signage. TSA did provide a card so we didn’t have to remove shoes, belt, etc. It was still awkward being behind “non regular” fliers that need 5 totes and 10 min to put everything on the belt for security clearance."
1734,7202,"I get to my flight I'm flying allegiant so I get to the airport early so that I can check in, the nice person behind the counter said that my TSA pre-check isn't valid for this trip and that I will have to go through the normal line, this line was so long that by the time I was getting my shoes on they were calling me to my flight because they were about to leave without me. I got to the airport an hour before I'm supposed to board the flight. The airport did look nicer but it looks like an airport from the 80s that just has a nice paint job."
1735,7209,"Its a REALLY OLD and SMALL airport, and i really didn't enjoy the stay. Even though i only had to stay there for 50 min, the services were pretty bad..."
1736,7225,"As an unaccompanied minor, my parents credit card information got stolen in the literal UM holding room. (These ratings are from the UM Program)"
1737,7231,"Bus shuttle between terminals outside is pretty m'eh, old busses that have no shocks so the luggage gets unforgivingly bounced around, and it takes a long, long time. The bags came out 40 minutes after the plane landed, even though the claim was relatively close to the gate, and it's an all American Airlines terminal so they should have it down pretty efficiently."
1738,7242,No problems
1739,7248,My least favorite airport. Everything is far away and the food options either fall short or have an hour-long line.
1740,7252,A absolute mess. It was horrible to get throught the airport especially with a dog and luggage. The trains were late and annoying.
1741,7262,"Leaving from ""McNamara terminal"" (Delta flight). Questionable check-in procedure, you must do the check-in by yourself at the machines (no alternative) but after you have a long queue to drop the luggage (and a badly controlled queue as well...). What is the gain of the self-check-in then? New safety procedure, totally different from standard... you keep your jacket on, but metallic objects and phones must go in the bags... might be more efficent on long term, now is just confusing. Layout of terminal is questionable too, very very long straight corridor... very long walks."
1742,7264,No free WiFi
1743,7270,THERE WAS DOG POOP SPREAD ALL OVER THE AUTO WALK WAY AND BY THE TRASH CANS. WAS NOT CLEANED UP FOR THE HOUR I WALKED BY TWICE.
1744,7300,Really small airport. Only 5 gates.
1745,7307,"Immigration here is the most complicated I've seen in the world. It seems every step in the process is designed to be more complicated for you. I don't understand why you go thru baggage claim first, then have to wind you way thru the queue with all your heavy luggage. Absolutely trash."
1746,7312,"I waited in a mile-long line at bag drop for two hours, which made me almost miss my flight. There was only one employee while the others were having conversations. Security wasn’t helpful that day."
1747,7354,"Harrisburg is the bare minimum airport possible in the United States. One runway, one terminal. A handful of food options, all of them overpriced and of poor quality. Never could figure out if the terminal even had a Wi-Fi system. This is the sort of airport that you use only when you have no other options. Having said that I'd rather fly here than drive to PHL."
1748,7361,"So In my opinion, the Honolulu airport is one of the most confusing airports I’ve been to, we did not find out that you had to go through agriculture to get to the mainland airlines, we made it with two minutes to spare, are flight was delayed by 3 hours because of the construction of the Honolulu Airport which made us have to run through the airport."
1749,7369,"Security line was near an hour long and the staff were kinda rude. Also, the USDA staff threw everyone’s luggage around while “checking for fruits.” The USDA’s X-ray machine also malfunctioned, causing bags to push each other off the conveyer belt and onto the floor"
1750,7375,"Pretty run down and awful looking. Not sure about public transport but the traffic did seem a bit chaotic. United Lounge was okay, it had a good view, however. The immigration officer was really cool, he even made small talk with us and told us about how he used to live in North Carolina"
1751,7376,Poorly laid out and signed. TSA was quick and fairly painless but every other aspect lacked - particularly the lack of options for fresh food in the terminal. Only one cafe where the menu is in Spanish isn’t good enough for an international terminal.
1752,7421,"Slowest bag claim in the world. Doesn’t matter the time of day or airline, minimum 20 minute wait."
1753,7425,"This is a very nice , small airport . One of the better Florida airports ."
1754,7430,"What an absolutely awful airport. Hot, cramped, not enough seating and the ‘lounge’ is a joke."
1755,7431,"What an absolutely awful airport. Hot, cramped, not enough seating and the ‘lounge’ is a joke."
1756,7446,"Smallest worst airport, avoid until the new terminal is complete, in probably last 2023 or early 2024."
1757,7447,"Narrow terminal/concourse, limited food/store options. The bathrooms were not clean. Difficult to get a Lyft/Uber/Taxi from the airport."
1758,7448,"Worst airport in the US. Not enough seats in terminal. 30 mins to wait on bag claim, another 30 mins for Economy Lot shuttle bus."
1759,7450,"MCI when it was built, totally fit the need for the area. Now that times have changed, especially with security, the airport is far from ideal. Only 4-5 per gates per post security area. Very few food options and in this instance, only one working Mens toilet for 100 or so people. Can’t wait for the renovations to be complete to see it become functional again."
1760,7462,"This is a VERY Mediocre airport. I love Hawaii but don't like KOA. The reason being is that it's extremely hot, all the vending machines and the water fountains are out of order. There's one restaurant in the entire airport. The WiFi was fine for downloading the UA app but it was finicky. Hope this place gets an upgrade."
1761,7464,"Usually small airports are quick and efficient. Not this one, took forever to move the bags about 50 yards."
1762,7465,"Not like any airport that I've been to. More like a bus terminal. No jetway to airplane. Must take ramps down to tarmac, thankfully it wasn't raining, but hard on my knees. Signage once in airport is 8 1/2 x 11 paper taped to posts. Best to just follow other passengers to baggage claim. Really just a jumble of open air buildings with no amenities. Really poor facility."
1763,7470,"2 hours in line for TSA!!! What a joke, loads of people missing there flights because TSA was to lazy to work more than 1 machine, shame on this excuse for an airstrip"
1764,7483,It was pretty nice. But when my kids walked out they saw the casino and thought it was an arcade for old people!????????????
1765,7491,"Took forever to get through the covid screening area. No air conditioning at the airport, it's kind of open. Crappy cell phone signal and no Ubers readily available."
1766,7494,ontime arrival
1767,7498,Stopover without getting out
1768,7513,"LAX is an embarrassment to the second largest city in the US. Traffic is slightly better since the airport inaugurated ""LAXit,"" a lot especially for rideshares. The problem is, unlike other airports, you can't catch your ride right outside the terminal, but, jetlagged and exhausted, you have to board a crowded shuttle to an offsite lot and wait again there. They're finishing an interterminal tram, but LAX still feels primitive and clunky compared to DAL, MIA or other better planned airports."
1769,7527,Small Midwestern airport whose FBO isn't really equipped to handle a charter EMB-145XL. Baggage handling difficult. The only de-icing truck they could find on departure was so broken down that it almost had to be pushed into place by hand.
1770,7537,"The absolute worst airport I have ever been to. Bare bones facilities, terrible food and drink services with the exception of Dunkin' Donuts, rude security staff, the airport is 2.5 hours away from Orlando and shouldn't even be considered an Orlando airport."
1771,7543,Everything shuts down after 8:30 pm! Landside doesn’t have any restaurants or places to eat properly. International airport unworthy
1772,7551,Busiest airport in the US and the western hemisphere for cargo flights.
1773,7554,MIA is not a good airport to transit. I was already stressed as there was little time between my flights. What I didn't need was the further stress created by the time it takes to transit. I also find US airports overpriced. There is the feeling that they know that passengers have no other options and up the price of everything.
1774,7555,Customs was a nightmare. More than 2 hours waiting. Dozens of passengers missed their connecting flights.
1775,7575,"This airport is terrible. Dirty in some places and a pain to navigate. The pick-up area by baggage claim is abysmal and the security presence is non-existent, cars are sitting there idle for way too long."
1776,7601,smooth
1777,7610,"TSA gets crazy here. The waiting line is across the airport entrance until the entrance door. They managed to increase the waiting time in the line from 30 Minutes two weeks ago to 50 Minutes. I was warned as friends had to queue up for an hour. If you want to fly from BNA, calculate an hour for TSA. No United Lounge available. The waiting seats look nice, made of stainless steel. Prevent you to sit too long..."
1778,7617,"The new terminal is 20 mins away from rental car facility by shuttle. The free shuttles run only intermittently and are packed. New terminal looks nice, but the difficulty getting to the airport w/o dedicated off-ramp from highway is quizzical."
1779,7618,"Avoid at all costs. Getting to the airport is very slow, buses are rare and taxis expensive. No food between 8pm and 5am. Internet is spotty, disconnects randomly and is slow. Aircondition is set to max, bring warm clothes if staying for more than an hour. Security doesn't seem to be able to handle big passenger amounts. Shops and restaurants are very limited. Avoid this airport unless you really want to go to New Orleans."
1780,7620,Seriously the most poorly maintained terminal in the US. Many in third world countries are nicer than this. Food and dirt and insects everywhere. I felt greasy and dirty just existing here.
1781,7621,"This is my home airport, and it is pretty awful considering the traffic volume. This is a black eye for New Orleans. Fortunately, there is a brand new, full size 35 gate terminal facility being built. It opens February 2019. Until then, bring your own food if Smoothie King can't hold you over for your flight. I will say that the Delta terminal D is actually very nice and modern. That is the only portion of the old 4 terminal airport that will remain after demolishing the old terminals."
1782,7624,"One of worst airports I’ve been. I departed from Terminal 1 and there was only one officer to check passaports,and the staff were very rude, constantly rushing passengers through security checks."
1783,7625,Abysmal security facilities even at 06:00 - not enough staff to open Priority Lane and inept handling of items once scanned. Not rushing back to JFK any time soon ;-( BA Greenwich Lounge was very well appointed - a bright experience after the dire Security facility.
1784,7632,"Due to constructions going on inside the airport, there is a discrepancy between what is actually running versus what the signs and announcements say how things are running. Getting from terminal 8 to terminal 1 was a nightmare because I got several mixed signals from airport employees and announcements. Almost missed my connection!"
1785,7633,"Awful. Rude and unhelpful immigration staff. Awful queue organisation. Poor number of booths open for the volume of passengers, waited well over 90 minutes without any information. Poor facilities once through immigration. All bags removed from carousel it took so long."
1786,7639,"Had the most expensive 'few food items' from one of the food outlets before going to the gate. There were four of us, two of us had a sandwich, two of us had a pasta-in-a-plastic-box; we had a bottle of drink each and one bag of sweets and it came to £91! I'm all for making a profit but that's taking the p***! Don't buy food at the airport; eat before you go or take a load of money with you."
1787,7652,"Awful airport. Nothing open, small and tired decor and facilities. Bad food outlets, no lounge and no information."
1788,7663,Little of no option to buy food apart from Starbucks.
1789,7668,"Some parts of the terminal are better than others. Very cold inside (AC turned up). Decent selection of news stores, but bad selection of restaurants."
1790,7672,"Hated this airport. The staff was rude, unhelpful, offered me a wheelchair because I was Deaf! The staff was highly uncoordinated, one didn't even know they offered flights via Norwegian Air! Worst airport ever. No food before security either."
1791,7683,Needs a remodel. Dirty. Employees don’t seem to care that work at the small restaurants. Terminal A is horrible
1792,7688,"Very small airport, which makes it nice for getting through security quick and easy, not much on the other side though, so pack your snacks."
1793,7691,"International Arrival is in another building. There are no facilities when you get out. Make sure your pickup knows where the international arrivals area is located. Outbound - there isn't a lot of selection in the terminal. It's pretty barren, make sure you eat something or grab food before you get to the terminal. It's all a bit sad."
1794,7692,Arriving into the customs building there are two flights at the same time most nights (Aeromexico and Volaris). Why they don't make them separate by an hour beats me! It was very slow although they did their best. Inefficient airport facility though as the main terminals are underutilized.
1795,7695,"Pretty far from everything, but a decent alternative to fly into LA/OC area."
1796,7700,F A B
1797,7713,Hated this airport! I hate the 45 minute check in and security lines. I can see why alligent made a hub here because they both charge you for the air you breath. Anything you buy here is expensive and seating is non existent in this crowded airport. I was going to have to drive 2 hours over to Melbourne that day anyway. I much prefer MLB or MCO.
1798,7714,Signage to the airport is very confusing. Had to loop around to figure out where long term parking actually was. Very long walk from parking to the terminal. Inside the airport is very confusing. Maze of poorly marked long corridors. Only 2 places were open to eat at 11 am. I'd prefer to use DAB or MCO.
1799,7717,"(Terminal A) The terminal was very small and dark. Poor lighting for an early morning departure. Check in was fine, and security went quick however we were at the front of the line and there are only 2 metal detectors. Bad wifi connection and not clearly labeled. Very few open stores and a minimalist food court. There was one window to look out of and Terminal B was poorly sign posted. (Terminal B) After a gate change we ended up in Terminal B. It was a lot brighter and more food and retail options. If you cant find anything in A, go to B. It is just down a corridor past the gate area."
1800,7719,"Pretty poor airport. Duty free looks good. Food is virtually non existant. There is an eatery but the food doesn't look fresh. Big area to sit in with one bar at the far end, a bit pricy though. There is an outside smoking area which overlooks the runway and the scrap yard area for planes. Other than allegiant there are very few airlines using Sanford. Monarch have ceased all long haul and Thomas Cook now use Orlando, which I feel is a far better airport"
1801,7723,One food line was 45min for to go and the other was 25min. Food is high priced and long lines. Need more options. Clear was all the way across the terminal and going through precheck was faster without it.
1802,7726,"The best little airport. The outside walk between Check-In / Baggage area and the two terminals is great. Parking Drop-off and car rentals are just a few steps or a short walk away. Only problems sometimes, a queue at security and no lounges."
1803,7736,"Domestic air travel is terrible. I paid for Business Class and received absolutely nothing for the additional expense. I was assigned standard seating in the 12th row over the exit window, and received exactly the same accommodations that everyone else was offered on board."
1804,7739,"Lot of construction (hopefully after that, this airport will look slightly better). Doesn't have CLEAR. Lounges not open"
1805,7742,"Trenton Mercer is a tiny airport, the terminal is basically one big room. The plus side is that security and check in are really fast, but at the gate it was super crowded. Took us 10 minutes for us to find a seat."
1806,7743,"Baggage check-in chaos. People missing flights because of waiting times. NO public transportation to airport, long, long walk from bus or septa especially with even minimalist luggage. TTN is way beyond start-up problems, need to get their act together."
1807,7764,"Waited in line for 40 minutes in the TSA Pre-check line because they were only using 1 lane in the ""alternate screening area""... Was directed there by a TSA officer, who said the lines were significantly shorter (which was blatantly untrue)"
1808,7774,"Check-In was a breeze and the agents were friendly. Gate had trash on the seats and floor. Gate agents boarded wayyyy too slow. Terminal facilities were mostly closed. One small gift shop had a line of 8 people because there was just one employee, and he was very slow. He admitted that he was just waking up. With 4 Gate agent, only two were actully working."
1809,7780,Good gateway to Maine .
1810,7811,Back to the School for Officer Training.
1811,7812,Fast baggage delivery and free wifi.
1812,7835,"This airport is about as bad as LHR. TONS of walking just to get to your gate if you aren't flying Delta. If you fly American, do NOT arrive any time earlier than 4 hours. you'll only be wasting your time, as they won't print out your checked baggage tags. I was lucky this time. You MIGHT be able to check earlier, but it's a big toss of the coin."
1813,7837,Horrible setup. No train between concourses. Long walk. One flight involved a long walk down scaffolding and then a bus to the plane.
1814,7838,"This airport is extremely crowded, it is still under construction, meaning you have to walk via an underground tunnel between concourse A and concourse B which will take you 15 to 20 minutes, depending how many pax you have to dodge. There is only ONE tunnel that connects the two concourses. The gate areas are over crowded, the gate lice over flow into the walk ways."

1818,7857,"Security is pretty rough with only 2 check lanes, sometimes only one. Pre-check doesn’t really exist, it’s integrated with the normal lines. They have you wait like 20 passengers per and then take pre check for a minute or two. Construction outside the airport is kind of bad too, getting backed up often."
1819,7861,Small and crowded airport. To change planes I had to leave secure area and then go through security again since gates are not connected by secure passageways. WiFi dropped several times as I moved from one set of gates to another.
1820,7865,Very discouraging to have no food or beverage options at the AS AA ticket counter area. SBUX has been closed for a few years.
1821,7870,"All escalators at rental carsstation of skytrain in maintance at same time? Why not, who would be on place like that with big luggage.. Baggage drop off also have original system. You have to print the bagagae tracking sticker yourself on kiosk. Then wait about 3m from the counter until employee takes it from you."
1822,7885,The airport is tiny. The custom is extremely inefficient. It took an hour to process 20 people. The most unfriendly custom I have ever seen.
1823,7896,I love smaller airports like SNA. They are so much easier to get in and out than monstrosities such as LAX.
1824,7898,"New gates almost done,"
1825,7913,"While I realize the airport is under construction and has been for some time, signs directing travelers to the places they need to be (checkin counters, TSA Checkpoints, etc) are not exactly informative. Flying from the North Terminal (Southwest), the temporary walls prohibit visibility to the airline checkin counters and cause excessive searching along the narrow passageway. Also, the way lines are set up for CLEAR and TSA Pre Check are at best, confusion and create confusion with travelers using those access points. I entered using the CLEAR line that does not go to TSA Pre Check, as the confusion created an exceptionally long line for the CLEAR access to TSA Pre Check. Hopefully, this airport will be greatly improved when the construction is completed."
1826,7916,"Customs was extremely slow even with MPC. I haven’t been in customs that slow in literal years. After customs, there was a single TSA line open for connecting to domestic flights that took about 30 minutes to get through even with only a few people in front of me. It turns out, I could’ve just followed the signs to exit then gone in through regular security (and used my PreCheck) but the workers didn’t say anything about that until we were 4th in line. On top of all that, the TSA workers were massive power tripping douchebags. Never had a worse TSA experience."
1827,7918,"The terminal looks very 80s in some parts the Delta staff were slow, the machines were broken and the baggage claim screens only show Alaska Airlines"
1828,7919,Extremely unfriendly homeland security staff who did not allow me to enter and did not give me any reason for the revocation of my visa.
1829,7937,"Bad airport, confusing to get to. Terminal is outdated and likely from the 70s. Some of the rudest TSA agents I've dealt with even with Pre-check. terminal has little shopping and food, and doesn't have a Skyclub. Overall disappointing airport."
1830,7948,"Easy to get to. Issue is lounges and the lack of them. Amex and piroty pass is useless. The airport is old and has lots of leaking pipes. Besides that it's clean and usable. It reminds me of old, lga. If you have access to admirals club or are military personal. Lounges aren't a issue."
1831,7951,"The rental car facilities are a nightmare - on the other side of the highway, rocky shuttle ride to/from the terminal, and confusing signage of how to get back to return the car. The terminal itself doesn't have much to offer food-wise (at least not the A gate (UA/DL), other than sit-down restaurants. I recommend Vino Volo as it seems to have a smaller crowd but the food is actually quite tasty (if on the expensive side). No lounge available except for an independent one in the other (Southwest Airlines) terminal. This airport was better way back in the day when it was a TWA hub, to be honest. Just not very impressive for a city of St. Louis' caliber."
1832,7965,"Really small airport with nothing exciting, only plus is that TSA times are really quick. No reason to be called an international airport."
1833,7967,"Honestly, KTLH is just about the worst airport, ever. The city of Tallahassee itself isn't much to write home about, but the outdated airport with an ""international"" designation makes it worse. It's tiny, it looks like it came straight out of the 1970s, and the interior has been ""renovating"" for quite some time now. The flights are stupid expensive, your only options are Silver, Delta Connect, and American Eagle, and if you don't want to go to Atlanta, you'd better like tiny aircraft. If you can, avoid TLH at all costs."
1834,7969,The airport and its access points are impeccable. UNITED onboarding service: OK Security check: it looks like a western where cows are herded. Elderly people or on the verge of abuse No UNITED Lounge for holders of a Business ticket pompously called First.
1835,7977,"Traffic was terrible en route to the airport, check in took 45 minutes due to computer issues. Security was rude and didn't seem to care, they didn't ask to empty bags at all, they weren't even watching the bags on the machines. Most of the restaurants were ""closed"" and the boarding announcments never happened so we almost missed our flight."
1836,7990,Last on Plane
1837,7991,"Medium sized regional airport with UA, AA, DL, and WN hub service on a mix of Regional and Mainline metal. Also Allegiant and Frontier service. Older terminal that could use some upgrades. Clean and well kept, however. Rental car return was odd, as it's unclear where to go to return the car to the right company. You then walk into the airport on the departures level, but have to go downstairs to the airline checkin counters, which are also a little hard to find. Back upstairs for security, which is fairly standard; one line for Precheck and most of the space for non-Precheck. Plain vanilla past security with a few shops and restaurants; not sure if there is a lounge but not one that I could use. Gate areas have clean seats and are well lit; boarding is quick and easy enough."
1838,8000,"The worst immigration experience ever. 2 hours queuing, hundreds of people, no place to sit, not able to go to the toilets without losing one’s place in the queue, no water. A total lack of information and respect from US CBP vis-a-vis both visitors and US residents! Most countries do a much better job (just go North of the border to Canada)…"
1839,8024,nice
1840,8026,"Small, simple airport. Easy in, easy out. Not much to do inside though, if you are stuck"
1841,8031,Airport is too small for the amount of flights it is serving. Waiting area is communal for all gates. It was standing room only for six hours of delays. All food sandwiches ran out at the one available food place on the secure side.
1842,8045,"There are barely any food options when headed to gates 1-12. Also, Dunkin donuts always has a super long line. It's best to eat before arrival to the airport, it saves you money, and alleviates the lack of options."
1843,8055,"Small airport, 3 programmed flights on time. Immigration fast track broken and only 30-40% I immigration counters open. Total more than an hour to go through checks. This is something previsible!!"
1844,8067,"Small Airport, everything is in russian. Pretty confusing on when to board. Security check takes away lighters..."
1845,8068,"There is nothing in the sterile area: no shops, no normal cafes. Duty Free doesn't work. Very dirty toilet"
1846,8074,"There are no shops, cafes, services etc. It is probably worst airport in the world. No wifi excists, people seak broken and bad english, airport is old and disfunctional"
1847,8075,One of the worst airport I’ve ever been too. Lazy slow staff. Wi-Fi not working. Wc is a nightmare. Never again
1848,8076,Security officers don't let you get in terminal untill check-in starts. You can wait outside for a few hours. WC rooms are dirty and smoke.
1849,8077,"Tashkent Aiport needs some serious updates. - Getting to the aiport: Taxi is probably the only reasonable option. If you book the Taxi from inside the Aiport be prepared to pay x5 times the actual tariff (around 60.000som). My recommnedation is to ignore the ""Airport information centre"" and book a taxi with Yandex Taxi (around 12.000 som). The airport is quite close to the city so expect a fast transfer. - Long queues at check in due to very limited check in desks. Allow you some time for it. - Security checks are just madness. A security check before entering the airport. Another one when entering. Additional control before entering to the boarding area, additional control when entering the boarding area and finally, final control before boarding the plane!! Insane. - Free wifi available, but local mobile phone number required. - Food and drink facilities are very limited. Many options shown in the food / drink menus not available. Prices are very cheap for airport standards."
1850,8084,"The worst experience ever in an airport. More than 12 hours late, bathrooms didn't work, people not friendly, lousy food."
1851,8086,"Everything was closed, there was no food and everything looked dirty. There were policemen everywhere and the flight was delayed because of them."
1852,8091,"what a mess and everything takes time, a lot of time"
1853,8092,TERMINAL-1
1854,8093,UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE AT CCS APT.
1855,8109,"Long and slow queues to security, very unpolite staff. Services in international terminal poor, restaurants extremely expensive"
1856,8116,Small airport and only one store in airport's waiting lounge.
1857,8121,Immigration was extremely slow for the volume of pax arriving. There was only 4 Immigration Officers.
1858,8124,"This is a horrible airport for flying out Internationally. It takes way too long to get through as there are 3 separate ID checks. 1 to get to the immigration line, 1 at immigration which is needed, and then the security check. There is no reason to have one pre immigration. This just caused us to wait a lot longer in line. The pre immigration check was then messed up even more due to the fact that they had no idea what they were doing and allowed a lot of people to cut. They then only took paper boarding passes, and not my electronic one. Its 2023. Catch up."
1859,8127,Horrible airport experience. Slow security check and immigration systems. Overly crowded. Everything is just horrible.
1860,8128,"Tsn airport is a decent airport when it is not too crowded, however, it is terrible when compared to other airports around the region such as Bangkok, Singapore or Kuala Lumpur. The check in is decent, but at the International terminal the immigration lines are always crazy long, since the airport still hasn't invested in smart gates, and the people operating are often very slow. Furthermore, there are individual lines for each counter rather than one long snake line which doesnt make much sense. The process could also be faster if they allow families to go together, but they only allow one at a time. At security, they make you take off everything including shoes, watches, ipads and belts, which delays the whole process and doesn't make sense to me since in many other airports you don't have to take anything out. The departure area is quite small for the main airport of a large city, and it clearly over capacity. There is not much to do, with mainly souvenir and a few designer shops. The food selection is also quite underwhelming, not meeting International standards. I have visited this airport many times over the last 6 years and barely anything has changed. While it's not the worst airport in the world, it is definitely one of the worst in Asia. The interior of the terminal is also very bland and uninviting, rather than open and airy, maybe okay for an airport in the early 2000s. It's a shame that they haven't made this airport more comparable to any other airports in the region, and I hope the new airport under construction will be better. Even though there are not many flights from here to connect to, if you have a connecting flight somewhere I urge you to choose Bangkok or Singapore instead as you will have a much more comfortable layover."
1861,8134,"As shown in my review inbound to SGN, the airport is a massive and messy airport. The check in process was flawless there was no queue for business class passengers. Our departure, which was around 12am was during the night time peak hours. Due to this, the 8-10 all passports emigration lanes weren't able to handle all of these passengers ( the lanes were handling passengers of 7 wide body departures and some narrow body planes departing.) The next step, the TSA check was another chaos where only 4 x-ray machines had to check all these people. Inside the terminal wasn't too bad and there was a decent amount of shopping options and some dining venues. We got the access to one of the SASCO lounges at SGN airport and we chose the Rose lounge, which was closer to our gate. The decent lounge had some hot meals and some tea and coffee and had great apron views. Overall, SGN airport should try their best to improve customers' experience by making the emigration and TSA check process faster."
1862,8135,"Worst airport experience ever. Our flight landed around 10""30pm which was around the late night peak hour. Our terrible experience started with the massive queue for immigration that just wasn't able to handle even with all of the counters open and we waited in the hot, humid terminal for almost 30 minutes for our passports to be stamped. Our experience just got worse when we found out that all passengers were forced to go through the customs in the ""items to declare"" lanes even if they have nothing to declare. The lane was packed with people and after our bags were scanned through x-ray machines, they were piled up and mixed up with other passengers' baggage and we needed to search for our bags. Now it gets even worse. Exhausted, we tried to sit down a little bit but we realised that there aren't any seating areas so we decided to catch an Uber with our phone which we failed since the airport wifi wasn't working. That was when several men from the taxi counter started to try to scam us. (these people are supposed to offer correct taxi prices and information to different areas, not try to scam passengers) Overall, the SGN airport is an embarrassment of Vietnam and HCMC deserves a better airport rather than this miserable, chaotic airport."
1863,8141,The clean international departure area is not air conditioned
1864,8150,Congested terminal and gate areas. Slow security lines and little seating areas. Very few places to eat.
1865,8151,If masks are required then they need to up the a/c. It was very hot and stuffy and you can barely breathe with the mask on. Only one place to eat! Food was okay.
1866,8152,CBP and TSA flow is hot mess. Not to mention the entire facility condition is tired and in desperate need of a refresh. Restrooms are disgusting.
1867,8153,"Get to the airport 3 hours early and bring an umbrella! The line into Customs and Screening is about 2hrs long since the whole CBP, TSA, Bag Drop is a hot mess! TSA does not have sufficient manpower to open additional xray machines, long lines at both bad drop and screening thus creating a back up at CBP which then CBP stops process passengers b/c they have no more room inside the building. And the umbrella is for when the Customs line is so long it extends to the sidewalk and if it rains, you will definitely get wet waiting in line. You have been advised."
1868,8154,"Typical Caribbean airport. The terminal is small, but easy to get around and the food and concession options are limited. Customs is usually very quick and easy to get through upon departure. Nov-April is high season. May-October is a ghost town."
1869,8163,"Airport was extremely hot and poorly lit. Was forced to use stairs to get to the Arrivals gate. Free WiFi not working, honestly the Airport just looks sad and tired and doesn't inspire confidence. Literally drains your energy...Hopefully the ongoing upgrade addresses all these issues."
